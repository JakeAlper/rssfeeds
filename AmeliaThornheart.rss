<p class="cnM4YTk0NjYzNmVlYjQxZTE4OTlhYTcyZGIyMWEzMmE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing Amelia noticed upon waking was the lack of pain. She had become so used to either the rotting ache of her disease or the sharp pain of needles that she had forgotten what it felt like to not be in some form of agony.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGY5MTE5ODg0ZDQ5NGY5OWE4ODlhMjkxZDdjNmIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body felt floaty and warm and her mind, normally racked with exhaustion and headaches, felt clear and rested. Feeling herself smile, Amelia set about trying to memorise these feelings she had long forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2NjMDJhMTM0NjQwMzdiZWU2NjI1OTAzNjhlNmFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few moments, she decided to risk flexing a few toes and was delighted to find that this didn’t cause the usual shooting pains. She moved a leg, then an arm, and then, deciding to risk it all, did something she hadn’t been able to do in years.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWRkZGVmZjRiYzRmZjBiNDI4OWNmOTY2MTdkZTg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmmh!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODFkN2Q2YTI4YzQzMTNhZWE4MWYxOGE1N2I1NWY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">She stretched like a cat, feeling satisfaction reverberate through her body. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NmI3YjNhZGUyMjQzZGRhOGU5YmVmMGFhNmIzMDRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Surely she had died and this was heaven!?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTY1NTA4MDM1ZDQ1MjdiYWNjYmE2M2RiODc4Mjgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, she was definitely lying on a hard wooden floor and that didn’t seem very heaven-like at all! Not that she was complaining; compared to her years in the hospital a floor like this was a welcome change of pace. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGI4NjQ2MzMyYjRlNzZhNjg2YmRlODViZjk0MDc4"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she thought, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I should probably open my eyes and see where I am.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhYjRiMjY2ZGI1MjQyYTU5OGM2YzI1YmM5ZTE1MGM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">A wooden ceiling looked back at her, striated with dark beams. Amelia sat up and found she was in some kind of office or study. The walls were covered with bookcases, cabinets, and tables. Where the wall was not covered in furniture, it was plastered with paintings. One side even sported the mounted head of a moose! Centred in the room, in front of her, were an ornate desk and leather chair flanked by two large windows. Behind her was a pair of double doors.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjdhM2ZmMjEwYjRlMmZiYWM2YzYzOGRmNGFhNDlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Using the desk as a handhold, Amelia slowly stood up. Amazingly, she still wasn’t in pain! Her knees didn’t feel like they would collapse under her own weight! They seemed… strong!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTRmNWRmNWY5NzRjZmNiYzMyZGRkZGVlMTk1N2Q5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m standing up!” she exclaimed to herself and the world.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTk2NGU2YTA2MzQ5ZTQ4NTc0ZDA3ZTJjNzY5MzE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">She took a few steps back and forth and then a few more. The feeling of not being weak was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">intoxicating</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She even did a few jumps, her blond hair rising and falling in waves.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzkzODMyZjBmMDQyOTNhZWY0ZDI3YmM5N2EyMGVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, her blond hair?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTI0ZjdhNTk1YTQ0MTY4M2VlNjAzNjdlNzkzNzgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia grabbed her hair and examined it. It was definitely blond, practically golden! How had this happened!? She was certain it wasn’t dyed, so then how did her hair change colour!? Amelia’s hair was supposed to be mousy brown, not this lustrous, shining gold! </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTMzMjE3OGIzYjQ4NjdiZGFiMTU2NTAzNzRmY2U4"><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked over the rest of her body, feeling herself frown. She wore a simple grey top and shorts that hung loosely, leaving her midriff and legs rather bare. These clothes were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">definitely</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> not the usual hospital clothing she’d grown so used to!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODMwMjRkN2Y3ZDRlYzM5OWUyNGRmMzNjOWIwYzNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Who was responsible for not only taking away her pain but also changing both her hair </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">her clothes!? Amelia looked around, her eyes settling on a painted portrait of a young woman. The painted lady appeared noble; she wore a white and gold uniform and had the same golden hair Amelia did. The refined depiction had eyes that were a brilliant blue and, on the woman’s forehead, two small, neat horns sat.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWYwY2IxNjFjODQxMjI5NWM2MDRkNDA5ODRjZGY1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Weird</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">but they do look cool</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait! Do I…?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlYzE3NWFhZDk0YzRhN2E4MzNlNDBhYmE3ZDFiNjgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hands snapped to her forehead. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2I4OTJiZWI0MjQwNDZhZmQ4NTJlOTVjZDQ3MGZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, what a shame!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDgyMDE1MzM0MzRhMTU4NmViZmJmYmUxZmQ2YjJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">While she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">didn’t </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">have horns, the weirdness didn’t end there. Continuing to examine herself, Amelia found that her pale feet, with all their ten cute toes, were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">definitely </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">not hers. Amelia had spent countless hours looking at her toes at the end of the hospital bed and these were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">her toes. Looking at her hands, she came to the same conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjEzYWIyYWFmZDRhYzdiMTIyMzM3NGM0NDQ4NWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">These were not her fingers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTI1ZDZhNGRhYjQ2ZjM4ZjQwYjQ3NWNiMzE0MmUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was not her body!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzVmZDI4YzViNzQyNTRiZmVhMjcwM2RhMGNkYWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">She found a mirror hung by the stuffed moose head. She raced to it and stared at her reflection, not quite believing what she was looking at.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2Y4ZDY0YWNhYTQ4ZTE5N2Y1OTVmMjg0N2Y5N2Uz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Golden hair. Blue eyes. No horns.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTM0Yzc2MDEyNTRmY2ViZDYzYTdkZDZjMjUyNzdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">And a face that only a fool would deny was unbelievably adorable and cute!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjA2NDhjZTIwNDRmM2FhMDk5ODgxMDgyMDI1MTgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no doubt! This was the body of Amelia Thornheart, the character she had spent years levelling in the hospital!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDY5MWJkYTRkYTQ3ODY5NjUwYTJlOGU5NjA4MjRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">But… why was she in her game character’s human form!? Her character was supposed to be a demonic combat mage with horns and black wings! That’s how Amelia had played her for years!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWM4Mzg1Y2ZjNTRmMjRiNzQxNDU0OTU2NGY5ZTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDFhNGQ0MmQzMzRmZGRhYzliZTJhODRkYjExZjVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia remembered the last time she logged in. She’d participated in a guild social event where they all took polymorph potions to change their form. To make things even more amusing, they undertook combat roles vastly different from their usual ones for that night’s PvE event.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTcwNmNhZjIyNTRlNTQ5ZTlhYzJlZmViZWFjYzc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">So, Amelia Thornheart, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">demon </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">mage of destruction and terror, was instead played as an adorable blond </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">healer! But why </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">she in the body of her game character? Was she still logged into the game world?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDdjMWFlOWI4ODRmZTlhYjMxMzgwOGE3ZWQ0Y2Ew"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">No</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Amelia thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkMTI1MGVkYTQ3MDQ3MTM4MzljZWQ5MGEyZmJmNDQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, she knew on an instinctive level this wasn’t a game world, dream world, or any kind of neurolink-enhanced simulated reality. This was the real world, with everything as corporeal and sensational as it should be.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2U1MGFmNDk3MDQ5M2JhZDNmMmJmZDFjNDE4YmUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Did that mean some divine power had recreated the game's world in some pocket of the universe, or did this world always exist, and the game was made to replicate it for entertainment purposes?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGI5MmZlYzExODRmMjFhZDA1NDdkYWY2NDVmN2Qw"><span style="font-weight: 400">More importantly, if her body had been changed to that of her polymorphed game character, then did that mean…?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTZiMGViMjZiZTRiMGViYTFiY2RkODRmMmRlYTgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Status,” Amelia muttered, a glimmer of hope rising in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjY5Yzk5ZDRiMzQ0ZmViOGQ2OTZiNTYyMTEyMzI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing. There was no floating game screen. Amelia tried a number of other phrases to the same disappointing effect. She even tried to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">will </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">her character screen into existence to no avail. She supposed it did make sense. If this was the real world, and she was certain it was, then she wouldn’t have access to her status screen.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODhmZTg4YmY4NjQ2NWU5Y2VlZTk5Yjc2MGZmNmJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">What a shame! She’d hoped to be able to access her in-game subspace inventory. Unfortunately, it seemed that the entity that had given her a new body hadn’t replicated the overpowered end-game armour and weapons she’d spent hundreds of hours grinding for!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Zjc3NmQ3MjE1YzRmZWQ5YjlkYmJlM2JiZjVjMTEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that she was complaining! Whoever her mysterious </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">creator</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was, they’d already given her the most valuable thing of all!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzFkZjIwYjAyOTRmYTJhODRiNGM5M2YzYzkxMGQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">A healthy body!</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDE3NTU0N2M1YjQ0NGM4NDUyMWY5YTk4OGNiYzY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia patted that very same healthy body, giggling to herself as she experimented with tensing her muscles and enjoying the sensation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">strength</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. As she explored her new body’s capabilities, a part of her mind became aware of something else that seemed to align with the game she played. She could sense an ethereal substance that floated within her in massive quantities.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzBhOGFlYWYxOTRhMTBiYjIwNzllYWI2NzZjZTZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Similar to how she instinctively knew this world was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">real</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she also somehow knew exactly what the mysterious substance was.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTk2MDcyZTQzNTQzYjg5NmVlNWRiZGNkZGJkOTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Aether. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NThkZmFmNzVkOTRkNGFhZjNkMDI2MTllZTQ5M2Q5"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, it was the primary resource for most magic disciplines. As a combat mage, Amelia had spent an enormous amount of time completing quests and hunting titles to maximise her aether capacity and regeneration. After all, she needed all that aether to cast her titanic combat spells! Her obsession with aether had earned her the nickname ‘Aether Addict’ amongst her guildmates.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjRmYjhjNmRlMDQyYjg5ZjhjMjA2YzhiZGFlMmIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">So she had aether, but could she cast magic?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODQ0MmQwNmM4ZjQzZjY5YTVhNjFhNWEyMjcwMjll"><span style="font-weight: 400">Canonically, magic was cast in-game by speaking the incantation. However, Amelia had grown used to casting magic by </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thinking</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the spell name. She’d been thankful for the game developers for putting that feature in, for she was often too exhausted from her disease to talk. Could she do the same here?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWRlYTA0MGQ2MzQ5MjVhNDhiMmY4MWYwMWY0NDEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, as she always said, nothing ventured, nothing gained!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTVlOGZiMGRlNzQwMDRiYTU3NGI4MjhiOWYzMTc3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">First-Circle, Ward of Thew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she said in her mind, willing the magic to manifest. Amazingly, she felt her aether tremble. It had definitely responded to her thoughts! Steeling her mind, Amelia tried again.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWU0MTRjZjUzYjRjMjRhNzEzZDEzN2M4MDYyZmJk"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">First-Circle, Ward of Thew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWJmODYyNzRmNDRmY2JhZjFkOWM1MTMzZjljZjA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, she felt an exhilarating rush as her aether twisted and turned inside her, moving itself into the required structure and then </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">activating</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. As the wardspell manifested, Amelia felt stronger and full of vigour. She felt </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">powerful</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She felt like she could stop a blade with her bare hands! Her skin took on a golden glow, matching what she remembered from the game.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjNkZWM5NjYyYjRhYTU4NjEwMjEyYmMwMjdmZGI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">That golden glow bathed the room in yellow light. That wouldn’t do! Amelia could hardly explore this new world while glowing like a lighthouse! She needed to do something about this!</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWQ5MWM3ZWM1MzQ2YmQ5ZGE5MGI5ZmE4ZmU0ZDdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily, she knew the exact spell she needed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDA0YWIxMjFmYTQ0MzQ5ZTljMWExZTg1NGVhNWJj"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Third-Circle, Cloak of Secrecy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWM3OTQyYTkyNjQyM2VhZmJlMzE5MWI1YjE1OGJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The cloaking spell activated, hiding the characteristic golden glow of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ward of Thew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She let out a sigh of relief. Thank goodness for that!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTkxZmJmMTU0NDQ3ODE4YTQwOTIyYzRkOGJhNDZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that she had some defence, Amelia felt confident enough to explore. Approaching the windows, she noticed they were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thick</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Perhaps six inches or more! She peered out and was met with nothing but a blue sky far above and clouds below. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzA1MDY3YWRhOTQ5MzVhMTkyODJhMzQ1YjA5NDFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was this building on a mountaintop?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzIzYjBkNTA1NjQ0ZjBiYzE2OGJiN2NjNTM0ODQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her attention to the desk. Upon it lay a large map that seemed to be of an archipelago. Numerous locations had been labeled and the owner of this office had pinned notes to different locations. Amelia peered closer to read some of them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzk2ZjQ5NTdkYzQwODg5YTczNzg4M2NkYTYyZTYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yup, she couldn’t read this!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmVhYTNjNmRkZjRkY2Q4NTE2ZTdiYzFkNjY1OTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">It certainly wasn’t English, nor did it look like any of the scripts found in the game!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmZkMTAxODk2MjRiYThiNTYxNmQ4MDBkZGE1MTM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What language is this…?” Amelia pondered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGJlZTI0YWViNjRkMjNhNTFkOTE5YzQ2ZDQwY2I4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That would be High Imperial, little one,” a coarse masculine voice intoned, causing Amelia to jump and hit her head on the ceiling! As she fell back down, Amelia realised her body wasn’t used to the extra strength the now-cloaked </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ward of Thew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> gave her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmM4ZGJlOGVlZTRiYTI4YTUyM2E5MmY4MDg0ZmUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who's there!? Show yourself, intruder!” Amelia shouted. “I have hands, and I’m not afraid to use them!” She held out her hands like a boxer while frantically scanning the room for the hidden speaker.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDNlYmU5ODY0NjRmMmM4Y2RjYjY3MzBiM2RhZGUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… hahaha!” the hidden man laughed. “I’m the intruder? What a strange human you are to accuse </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">me </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">of the crime </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you’re</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> guilty of! Yes, yes... Over here. No, no… to your right, by the mirror, little one.” Amelia followed the voice until her eyes settled on the source.</span></p><span class="cjQxOTZiNDQwZWYyNzQ2YWU5YTY5ZjExMGRmMGU4NTI2"><br/>Unauthorized use: this story is on Amazon without permission from the author. Report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkMTAzMWY1NTE5MTQ5MWVhMzVhMjVmNTcxOWZiNjJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A talking moose!” she blurted out, looking at the stuffed moose head.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGUxZTBlZTIzNjRiZGVhZmRjNGRjZDNiYWM0Zjlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a talking moose!” the talking moose exclaimed. “I am… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Anathor</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! The guardian of this ship and adviser to its captain. I-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjFhODNiMTUzYzRmMTM4ZWNhMzdmNTk2MjliMWMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re on a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ship</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!?” Amelia interrupted. She darted back to the window, peering through the thick glass. “Then why can’t I see the sea!? Where’s the water!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjVlNjIxMDkzYjRlYWI5M2NjOWM5ZmQ3MzgyYzNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hrmph,” grumbled Anathor. “I said we're on a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ship,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> little one… the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! A mighty military vessel feared for leagues around! This is no mere watership for harvesting salt! What use would there be of putting a warship on water when we have the skies?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGNlOGI2YjRiYzRjNGY4MmEyMDMxYTRhNzk0YWY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">flying</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? I’m on a flying ship!?” Amelia bounced back to Anathor.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzBjOTljMDdmYjQ0N2NiNWZhNGZjM2IwMjMxZjMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Flying? Fish</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> fly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. We’re </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sailing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Anathor paused before quickly adding, “We forget ourselves! The topic of this conversation is you! Who are you, little human, and what are you doing in the captain's quarters?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmMzNmY5ODVmYjQzZWY4ZjdjYzgzOWRmOTU0ZjQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anathor’s glassy eyes took on a red tinge that Amelia supposed was meant to be threatening. Surprisingly, she found herself completely calm. It was a weird feeling, considering the situation. She </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">supposed </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">she should be frightened or otherwise intimidated, but somehow, she found herself lacking any feelings of anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGZmM2U2ZjdlYjQ2ZmM5YTMxZTVjMjRjYzBlYzZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, she felt </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">excited</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! Whether it was the giddiness of her pain-free body or the thrill of using magic, something in Amelia told her that if she kept being positive, everything would work out!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjhhMzVkYmVjNDRkNzc5MmQyMmI0MjVjZDQ2MjQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, Amelia had a certain </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">feeling</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that Anathor wouldn’t harm her, and even if he tried, she was confident she wouldn’t be harmed, owing to her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ward of Thew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was a strange sensation to be able to instinctively determine the relative strength of Anathor and her magical defence. Had she inherited not just her game character’s body but also its stats as well? </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmRiODMwM2RkZjRiMzRhMjI4NGNlNjdiODNmMDEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, the higher a character's perception stat was, the more capable they were of determining what can and cannot harm them and the general nature of another creature. As a max-level combat mage, Amelia Thornheart had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">tremendous </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">base stats, boosted by months of achievement grinding. It seemed that enhanced perception was now part of Amelia’s new body.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmNlMGIwYWUwZDQ2ZTJiOGQwMjE4YTEyNDFjMWE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">She just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">knew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that Anathor was someone of good character and not dangerous!</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGIzZjNiNTg4ZTQ3MjliYjJjMzM4MTNhY2M1NDAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, not dangerous to her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmNmNjk4OTJjYTRmNzE4NjllNmY3MTUxNDEwZmFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Collecting her thoughts, she answered Anathor’s question.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDNjZWMxNTk5ZjRlYmM4NDg1OTVkZjQyZWZjZTU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m Amelia! Pleased to meet you, Mr Anathor!” she chirped, giving a polite bow and flashing the red-eyed moose what she hoped was a charismatic smile. Her mind was racing, trying to think of how to approach Anathor’s second question. What </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she doing in the captain’s quarters? It wasn’t as if she could explain that she was a virtual avatar that some great power had somehow created in the real world and moved her soul into! </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGM3ZGM2ZTQ5ZjQ0YzU4NTUyNTgyZGMzNWY2ZmNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">That didn’t mean Amelia had to lie. Amelia hated lying.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzcxYmJmYmZhNTRkMzA4NjNiZDZlMGQyYTNhOTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">But she could also rephrase the truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTk5ZjQ5NjgzMDRiN2U5Nzg4M2FkNjAwMzkwYjk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As for why I’m here…” Amelia began. “After a long battle with a painful disease, I was finally cured of it! But somehow the cure has magically transported me to this location unknown! I really didn’t mean to come here! It was an accident, I promise!” Amelia swallowed before continuing, “To be honest, I don’t know what the future holds for me, but after being bedridden for so long, I want to travel and explore the world!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTEyZTUxNjM5ZTQ5MTlhNGQ3NjQyODJmYjRhMWNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">As she spoke, a sudden idea flashed in her mind. After all, this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her game character, and she knew she could cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ward of Thew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. That spell was from the divine healing branch of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and while her true magical talents lay in ridiculously overcharged combat magic, it wasn’t like she wanted to go around destroying everything! Anathor did say this was a military vessel, after all. Wouldn’t her healing magic be valuable to its captain?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmFkZDVkMzI0ZTQyZjNhNDM5NTRkZDE3MDlhOTA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wouldn’t she be able to explore this world by just staying here? She could at least learn about the world before deciding whether to escape! Amelia nodded to herself reassuringly. She opened her mouth and said, “I have some talent in magic healing. If this is a military vessel, perhaps your captain would allow me to offer my services?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGU5OGEzNWZjODQyNjJiODJmZWU1OTM2NDljMTE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anathor was silent for a full minute.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzhkNzQwOWY2MjQyMzBiNjU4NzY0ZGU0MThlNmNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm….”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWVlMmNiMDI4NDQ5MzViMTgzNDI4ZWFjMTk2NmEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mr Anathor?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmUyMGQyZDNiMDQ5ZDY4MjE5MjhhNzJkMjRkNTBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a strange human you are. Your personality… reminds me of…” Anathor grumbled something indecipherable before announcing, “Nevertheless, you may explain yourself to the captain!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzlhOGMyOGRmMzQ2NTI5ZjRkNTgzYWQwNTE3Mzhl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The captain?” Amelia question. “Uh, sure! Where is he?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTUyMGJmNDViNzRhYjc5NDI4N2VkZmE0ZDNkMWE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is here now. Be warned… she can be a little… angry.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTkwYWVjN2FlNTQ5Yzc4YzI4NTJjMjA1Mjc1M2Vm"><span style="font-weight: 400">As Amelia processed that last sentence, the double doors burst open and suddenly there was a cutlass in her face! A real, steel </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">cutlass</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! Attached to this shining blade was a firm and steady hand, and attached to that hand was a towering figure in a neat black military uniform trimmed with gold. On the top of this figure, a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">beautiful</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> demon face was snarling at her, with deep crimson eyes, smooth black hair, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">a set of magnificent horns!</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiZGJiMzAxMTNlMjRiYjhiNzc2ZDU3OWI0N2IyZjkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A demon! A demon captain!” she exclaimed, admiring the figure that looked like it belonged more in a storybook than reality. She found herself getting lost in the captain’s crimson eyes. Yes… she could work for such a pretty captain!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWE0NTNmNzY4MTQ4NzhhMzgwNGM0YzllN2IzZjZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially one that made her heartbeat race!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjE3M2VlZWE3MjRlNTRiMDI5NDIzM2ZiYThkYTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, she felt her cheeks warming. She wouldn’t blush, would she? What would-</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTNiYjUxNTZhOTQ1Y2I5OGYwYWQ0NzNhOTBiZTI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Port or starboard? Pick one!” the captain suddenly snarled at her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDI1MjdkNmUyODRlZjBiOGU1NzRjYjRjODhiYzc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh…” Amelia frowned. “Why?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2Q2MDU5OWFkZjRmMTdiMDBkYTAxOTdmMTIxMmU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll let you choose which side of the ship we hang you from after you spill everything you know, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human spy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” The last two words were punctuated with little jabs of the cutlass, now millimetres from Amelia's nose.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWViMGJmZjNiNDRjMDQ5N2VkMzY1MDQ5NjY0YjI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, this job interview was going rather badly! </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjBhMTUwYTVjNDRlNDliNzVlNWNlM2Q5ZjQ1NGUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">She would need to fix this quickly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTk1MWZkMTM0MTQxYTU5NzhiOTNiOGNkZGMxY2M1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I like your horns!” Amelia said with a smile and tilt of her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDNkZjY0YjRhOTQ5NjNiN2E1ZTQzZDMxNWNmZTcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The demon captain opened her mouth and then closed it, a moment of confusion flashing over her face. This was excellent, as it meant Amelia’s cuteness had started to come across to the angry demon! Now was the time to push the attack!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGE4Zjg2Y2U1NjQyOGRiMWQ0MGEzODcwYWE0NGRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, they’re super intimidating, of course! If that’s what you’re going for… but they’re also really pretty, you know? Can I touch them? Please!?” Amelia made sure to flash her best let’s-be-friends grin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTk4ZWNiYmU4OTQxZjI5MmVkYmFhYmI5OWVjYTc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The captain and her guards were stunned. For a few moments, the captain’s quarters were silent apart from a faint chuckling coming from Anathor. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">the compliment was badly timed, but after feeling so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">good </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">after so many years of feeling </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bad, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia felt like she wanted to be nice to everyone!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWU3NzNlNTMyMjQ1OWNiMzk2MTJmZjYxZjJkMTk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You…” the captain began slowly. “The Republic must be getting desperate to send a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">mad</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> human to spy after me. Ran out of sane assassins, did they?” The captain punctuated her point by tightening her grip.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjZmMGFjMGIzOTRhZDI5NjdjMmFiYjIwZGU5YzIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not a spy! Or an assassin!” Amelia protested. “I’m a healer! Would you like to hire me… perhaps?” In response, the cutlass poked her nose a little. Her skin wouldn’t be so easily pierced with the ward active, but Amelia could sense this captain had some real ability. Now that she looked, she saw the demon was glowing with a subtle red aura.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjEyYTg2NTlkYzQxOGJhNTM4YTIzMDczMTQ5ZmQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, if it came to it, Amelia was sure she could Speak the First-Word, but that would destroy the captain’s quarters, if not the ship itself! If they were really flying, no, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sailing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> through the skies, then she would rather not condemn the crew to death!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGUzMDgzYTdkNDQxYzNiZDNlMzM5NWMyYzI1Mjg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although… she should have the skills to protect them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWUyNDMxNDY0MzQwN2I5MDVhNWM3MjFkNTkyZWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain,” Anathor piped up, interrupting Amelia’s train of thought. “Perhaps we should not be so hasty in our judgment. Perhaps we should confine this human below and have a discussion about how to proceed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDhiYzBmZTNjNTQ1YmU4Y2IzODczMGQ1OTg2YmQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anathor,” the captain dryly intoned, not moving her eyes from Amelia. “The human is a spy or an assassin. There is no reason to keep her alive.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWUyNGQxNGQ5OTQzYjJiNzI4ZTQ4MjU4MDcxMzUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm… the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> has suggested otherwise.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2RkYmVhOTYwZTRjM2ViMWU4MTZiNmVhZWRhMWQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The captain's eyes widened, briefly snapping to the moose before settling back on Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmEzZDBlMzE1ZTQ1NTJiODdmZTNkMzllMTgyNjNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The… ship spoke to you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjc3YjI1ZGE3MzRmYTY5M2I5ZGQ0NDNhZTEwMDU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2VjNDIwNmQwYzQ4NmJhYTZmNTVlMjM4Njc1MDQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia couldn’t believe her ears! Not just a flying ship, but a talking one!? What a strange place Amelia had found herself in! There were no flying </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">or </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">talking ships in the game!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODI0MTAyNjEzZTRkNzg5MDJhZjU2MTkwYTQyM2U4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The captain kept glaring at her for a few more seconds.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmQ4ZmQyNWQwOTRlOTA4Yjc0YzE1MjcxNTVmMzli"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia grinned back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzNlNWYxZjU5ZjQwZDA5ZjJlZmFjYmUxN2MyNGM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, she just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">knew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> this demon wouldn’t harm a single golden hair on her adorable head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmU3YmVjNzc1YTQyODQ5YTkzMmMxZTk3NmU0Njdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take her below!” ordered the captain. “Kill her if she resists!” At her command, several more demon soldiers appeared. These were male and, despite their horns being larger, Amelia thought they were much less impressive than the beautiful pair the captain sported.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2Q1MDJiNGQzZTQ0N2ZiZjQ2MzliZGI1NDJmZjk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">She allowed them to put her in chains and a sack on her head. She soon found herself lifted off the ground and being carried away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjQwMTVlMGYzNTQ0Mzg5NzcxNzc5N2NjN2MzZjJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed they didn’t even trust her to walk.</span></p>
<br/><br/><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></div>

<div>
<p class="cnM3NWRjN2M4NmVlMjQ1ZjRhNjY4ODgwZmU1OWE2ZGIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena examined the office and her desk for any traps or missing documents. The desk drawers didn’t appear to have been opened and she couldn’t see the telltale marks of any lockpicking tools.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2I5NzcxYjc5OTQwZmQ4NGY2YTc4OWU4N2Q2M2Nm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anathor had told her as much. He’d been notifying her of the spy’s activities the moment he had discovered her. Still, Serena didn’t fully trust his recollection of events, especially as he couldn’t tell her how the human had bypassed so many locked doors and guards to get into her quarters.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWRmOWJkNTk3ZTRjYTc4NmQ0YWE2Y2JhODhhNDli"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t understand. How can you, the guardian of this ship, not know how she got in here? You see </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">everything</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjU5ZGZiZTdlZjRhYjZiN2Q1N2FhYTNiMGUzODZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” the stuffed head mumbled. “The human was not here and then she was.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWRiNzRhODFlNjQ1ZTlhMmI3ZTJjZTQ1OWZjNmNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you see her arrive?” Serena sniffed. “The moment it happened?” For a moment, she thought she caught the scent of something burning, but it was gone before she could identify it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmYyMGEyNzRhMjRhN2E4ZGU5MGRmMjk2OWFmMjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No… and there was no change in the aetherfield. I don’t understand it myself. A realm-shift makes the most sense… but there are very few beings capable of hiding that from my eyes, Captain.” Anathor was quiet for a few moments before continuing, “And… even if I was fooled, no power could fool the ship. If this human were a true threat to us, it would have expelled her.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzYyNDQ1ZTk2NjQ3ODE5MDAzMjZkNWQzYmYyNGY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena raised an eyebrow. “A threat to us or the ship? It has allowed assassins to board before.” Anathor didn’t seem to have a response to that. His connection to the ship was only slightly more reliable than her own. Serena waved a dismissive hand. “Enough about the ship. Tell me again how she behaved when you first saw her.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDA3NTBmNzI5OTQzYjRhNGVkZTUyNWM1ZjI5MmZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She moved… as if she was unfamiliar with her body. At first, she was hesitant in every motion, like your injured soldiers with grievous wounds. The human seemed delighted to find she could move. She did not behave like a spy or an assassin.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDJiMTNjMDExMzQwZmJhMTdlZTJjMTY4MTk4M2Vh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena sat in her chair, tilted her head to the side, and began tapping one of her horns in a rhythmic motion.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDMzZjdkYTZkOTQ3YzQ5MmM5MTJhZDU1MDA2Nzhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And then?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2Q4ZjYwOTMyNzQ3YThhNTBjZmE5MGQ4ODk3M2Jh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She seemed surprised at her hair and body. She rushed to examine them in detail in the mirror. She was excited. Relieved. As if it was her first time in a new body.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDBmZjQxMWU3NDQ5MjViN2ZhNTMzNDJiMDUzN2Iy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh? A potential realm-shifter and now a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">darkblade</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? Come now, Anathor. We are reaching fantastical levels of theory over a mere </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Tell me of the spells she cast.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzI1OGM5N2JhYzQyMDE4YjgzNmQwMTAxZTViMGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A low-level defensive spell, silently cast, so she should be at minimum a second-circle mage. However, she cancelled it not long after. Hmm… no, it’s unlikely…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTE1NTE4MmNhMjQyMjdiZTk4OTkwMzViZjdlZGUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Speak your mind, Anathor.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzRhYTU4YjJiMTQ1NzM4ZTk1MTIwZDk4OTY4M2E4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When the spell was cancelled… the aether was unusual. There was no dissipation into the aetherfield from the residual aether. She might just be a talented second-circle capable of cycling the residue aether or…” Anathor trailed off.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjI5ZmQ3NGI2ZDQ2YWViM2VmOGY5NGJiNWM1N2E3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Or she didn’t cancel it. She cloaked it,” Serena finished Anathor’s line of thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzEwZWUyZmQ4ZTQyZmM5MDIxNDdhODQ0MjkxNzg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… if she can cloak even a low-level spell to that degree, then it’s likely she’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">third-circle</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. And if she’s third-circle, then…” Anathor’s eyes flashed. “There’s a chance she knows the First-Word, Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTFlZDI3Y2RhNjRiNjlhMTQxZDMxNThhMThmM2Y1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena wanted to dismiss the possibility, but her dutiful military mind entertained the possibility. It was rare for a demon to be a Speaker of the Words, and even rarer for a human. It was improbable such a young human could Speak, but… it was not without precedent. And </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">if</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she could Speak, then Serena had to wrestle with the fact the ship </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">allowed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her to board.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTA2ZWU3NzFmMjQ3MTA5MzdmZTY4OTRlZTJhMmYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which meant the human wasn’t a threat to the ship.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzBlN2ZlNTQ0ODQ2ZjI5NWZlNzRiMGFiZWQ3OTNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a memory of her encounter sprang to mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjdhMzYyZWRmOTRhZTE5OTliM2QwYWIxZWFiOWVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anathor, what is she doing now?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGM1OWJiZTEzNTQxYmVhZGNiMjQ2OWFlZmE4NGM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s in the cell, uh… stretching.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGU1YjVkYTJmYjQ1Y2NhMzcxOWM5NzNiZTMzYzAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stretching?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGYwNGE2OTIyNzQxYjY4MjZhZjNhZTlkYThjMDk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Captain, and now… she’s doing push-ups. Tomes and Dagon are watching her.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2RiM2FmMzJmODRjMjlhY2FiM2FiYmMzNTEwMzc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena shook her head. Was her captured human just an idiot after all?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjY4YmEwNjE1NDRmM2ZhYjYzZWI2NDJjNjI4NGMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does she have a cut on her nose?” she asked. “Any blood?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMThiZTNmNjJiNzQ3NGJhYjQ3ZjcxZTYxMTI0MDY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… no Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjUzMzJiMWU5NTRkZjU5YzRkNGY4NDdjYjJmODNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt her eye twitch. She was skilled with the blade, and she’d definitely given that smug-looking human a poke with her cutlass. If she wasn’t bleeding then the chance that the human had a cloaked defensive spell active was suddenly uncomfortably high. Clicking her tongue, Serena communicated her thoughts to Anathor.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTE4ZjliMTg2ZTQ0ZjJiYWM1MmNhYjk0NjljMzU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… time for you two to have another conversation. Not many leagues till we’re at battle stations.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmQ5OTU5ZjNhYjQxZTc4NDVhZjkxZDYyNmViZTE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.” Serena found herself nodding. “A little interrogation to answer some questions.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDczZTk0YzQ3ZDRkMTA4NzYxMGZlOTExMzBmM2E4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Try less </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">interrogation</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, more </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">conversation </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">if possible, Captain… best not to have any Words Spoken on the ship, by either that mystery human or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM4Zjk1ZjVlY2E5YzQ1MTU5MTE3OTNjZDQzM2U2Mzdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Forty-nine… fifty!” Amelia finished her last set of push-ups and sat up. It felt so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">good</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to move her body! How many years had it been since she’d done a push-up? Or a squat? Was exercise always this enjoyable? Those foolish demons, they thought these thick chains on her hands and legs would restrict her! Ha! Rather, they’d given her ample opportunity for some resistance training!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTRjMTMxYmNjMDQzYTdiNjFlN2E1NzZiOTM5NDJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was amazed at how her game character’s high base stats and ward translated into such strength and endurance. Amelia could tell the chains on her were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">heavy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, no doubt designed to seriously slow down any movement or escape attempt; however, she found it remarkably </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">easy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to move around.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGZjOTdjNWIwNzQ1MDRhOWU1YzIyYjk0ODk3NjAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Being this strong after so many years of being weak made her feel giddy. Perhaps she was drunk on power? Either way, her imprisonment did nothing to reduce her enjoyment of this new life.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmQwMWViODc0ZDQ1MjJhZWI2Zjc1MDM0N2MzMWJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her cell was no more than a two-metre-by-two-metre box of iron bars that extended from the floor to the ceiling. It was one of a line of cells that were arranged in the centre of this deck of the ship, but Amelia’s was the only one occupied. Hundreds of cargo crates and barrels lined the walls, with just enough space left for the demons to walk around and between the cells.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTEzNmE5MjBkMTRhZWM5NjY0NTg3NTQwYTE2NGYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">And leaning on these very crates were the two demons that had manhandled her so aggressively! They had thrown her hard enough against the bars that she was sure she might have broken something if she had been a normal human being!</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDc4YTVkNjQ3NjRiMzM5NjEyNmRhNzk4MDY5ZTgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">But, a normal human being was something she very much wasn’t! She was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the top-ranked dreadmage of the Blacksteel Crusaders! What player had spent sleepless nights slaughtering thousands of archangels to be the first to finish that collection log? She did! What player had the most solo speedrun records for the Abyssal Dungeons? Her!</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWFjODNjNDRjYTQ4MmU5MzYwZWQ1YTY0ZDBlMTM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, the iron bars were the ones in danger of being broken and she would definitely be complaining about her experience to the captain! She should start by giving these two a piece of her mind and-</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmRjNDA1YWJiMTQ3NzZhM2Y0NmJlM2YxMTQ1ODE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, what were they saying?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWY4NTI2NWQ2MDQ1YmU5MDkwOTQyMjRkZGE5YmEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, what was that?” Amelia bounced up to the iron bars.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjViMTA5ZGY0YjQ2NmNhMmJmMzU0NjE2YzkzNjI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two male demons were ridiculously muscular. If her current body was accurate to the height she chose in character creation, then these two, who stood more than a head over her, would be about seven feet tall! Their hulking figures were dressed in some kind of military uniform, with one of them having a pair of stripes on each shoulder. Holstered in each of their belts were a sword and a firearm. They were both bald, with deep orange eyes set under a thick brow and above a square jaw. Their skin was marbled with black, grey, and red in a similar way to the camouflage patterns of a modern military uniform from her old world.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjU1YjY5YzE4NzRjNjA4MmJlNjA2NTc2YmQ3Njhl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Each wore a set of heavy curled horns, similar to those found on a ram.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWY1ODQzZjliYzRjMTFiYTRhM2ZlMzI2NGI5ZTcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The demons from the game world didn’t quite look like this. Other than herself and her magic, most of the things she had already experienced seemed to indicate this world was very different from the game she played in the hospital.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTVjZDBjYWVmMTRiZTJhODI2M2U1ZDI2NTViODk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cap’n gunna make toothpicks of your bones, human,” one of them said to her with a grin consisting of chunky white teeth. “Ain’t that right, Dagon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGQ4ZWZmZTlkMjQ5OGFiMjU1YzQ5NWQ5ZWUyM2Ri"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right you are, Tomes,” said Dagon, flashing her his own grin. “You ’member the last one she broke? Hung him up from the starboard sail.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzExODlhYzBiMjRhNjZhZDRjZDc5MGJkYmUxZTcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Used him for target practice we did, didn’t we Dagon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWYxNTJhNjJkZjRiOWVhNzI5NWE3ODJjODY4ZDI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dagon nodded, smirking at her. “Screamed all night he did, didn’t he, Tomes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDgzMzEzMzNiNDRiMzM4YjY4ZGI1Y2MyNjQzNzFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That awful howling. Kept the entire crew up all night it did, didn’t it, Dagon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDE1ZGIwZTU1YjQyMGJiYjFhZTk2ZTQxYTNhZjU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Truer words never spoken! Cap’n kept his skull to drink her wine fr-“</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjA3Y2MxODc0NDQxYWVhNGZiMThhOWRjY2NhMzRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute!” Amelia interrupted. “She tortured someone </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">all</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> night? Kept you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">all</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> awake?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzhkZWE4YTc4NzQyNjhhOWY2MDc1Mzc0MDVhYmFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dagon spat on the ground, his forehead furrowing in annoyance. “Damn straight, little human, exactly what’s gonna happen to you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjJhYmQ2MTE0YjQ5YWU4ODlkNTI2MDdlZDAyNDhi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia wasn’t buying it. She crossed her arms and asked, “The captain made her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">entire</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> crew, which operates a</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> military ship</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, go an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">entire</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> night without sleep!? Huh!?” The demons paused at that and Amelia took that as a sign to push the attack. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hrmmph</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! Sounds like </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">someone’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a terrible captain! Or maybe… maybe you’re just trying to scare me with your exaggerated and made-up tales, hmm!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODhkOGZhZGVjMzQ5NzdhZTk2MTEwNmQwZWRjYjgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dagon looked stupefied; his mouth opened in response, but nothing came out. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGJiN2RmYmQ3MTQxYmY5YTY4MWIyNjcxYzllYzRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Tomes who spoke next, his expression darkening.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzJlM2E3MTY0ZTRkNjhhZGE2YWZmMGU2YTIwZWM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exaggeration or not, little human, the captain really does torture and hang those that endanger her or her crew, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…” He punctuated with a finger jab. “Are a threat. If you tell her everything you know, she’ll give you a quick death. Seven hells, if you’re extra cooperative, she might even dump you on an island somewhere. She-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjUzOGFmNmUwYjRmNGY4YTYzNWY5Mzk5M2IyYTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomes. Dagon,” a cool voice intoned from the shadows.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODVmOGQ1NWU1ZTRmMWViNzg4OGQwN2Q1NGUyMTE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The captain stepped forward. By head height, she was shorter than the other two, although her horns just about made up the difference. The captain’s eyes were fixed on Amelia, her arm resting on her sheathed sword.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjNjODg0ODY1NjQ4M2NhYzMxYzhiNDc4MmZkZjJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was easier to see in the dim lighting, but the captain’s skin still emitted a subtle red glow. Amelia might have missed it if it hadn’t been for her heightened perception. Was this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">aura?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> If it was, did it function the same way it did in the game?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTYxZDhiOGFjODQ5Y2ViM2QzYzA5N2I2N2RmNjMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia raised her chained hands and gave her a little wave.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWUxZDUzY2M1ODQ3NDY5ZDdjMTY5NGRmYjA0N2Y4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello,” she whispered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmI1OTNmZTAxNzRiODA5MTYzM2Y4YzljMjNmNjU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Any troubles?” the captain asked her two subordinates.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjZhMTUxMDYxNTQ3ZTZhM2MzYTYxYWFlOTYxMDJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, Cap’n!” they both exclaimed in unison.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDg1OTM2ZjVjZjQwODM4MjNlNDk4MmY4NzBlN2Y0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just recounting to our little spy here ‘bout that cutthroat that snuck on board last moon,” Dagon explained. “Don’t think she quite realises what situation she’s in. Want me to smack her around a bit?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjQ1YzhiYmQ3ODRhNGE5MGEwZGNlNTlkZThhNDQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The captain didn’t reply immediately and kept her eyes locked with Amelia’s. What was she thinking? She did seem a little… calmer. Maybe she’d had second thoughts about her employment!?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDljYTM1NjljNTQ4Y2E4OTZiMWNmZWRhOGFjMmE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomes. A word.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDAxMjViZDRhMzQ4ZGVhNjhkMmMwMGExMTZlMThk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Cap’n!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTgxZjQyZDlkOTQyZjdhOThlODRiZGU2N2UwOWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomes stood up and followed the captain away down the line of cells while keeping an eye on Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWU1MmYxMDM4ZTQxOGZiZTVhZDI4YTFlMGJjNzA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite her feeling of delightful drunkenness at having a new body, Amelia realised that not once, from the moment she was thrown into this cell, and even now with Tomes and the captain walking away, and even now with Dagon watching her…</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGM5NDVmYzVhMTQ4ODViNDhjMmM0YTk1ZTFmZDBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Did any of them ever remove a hand from one of their weapons.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzYzI4ZDRhOTlmMjQxYWZhMWM4M2NlNzQ4MTQwMjcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena walked Tomes to the end of the cells, as far away from the human as she could be while still keeping her in sight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGJjNjY0ZjgwYjQwMjY5MmIwZTFhZTdjNzlkMTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did it go?” she asked in hushed tones.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjU2M2Q1OGM4YzQ3M2FhMTZlMjAyYzRhOTg1ODJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomes took out a pair of neat spectacles and slid them up his nose, responding in an equally low voice. “Something's not right here, Captain. I’ve been at war long enough to know how humans react to us, and I know what a frightened human looks like, and Captain, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">she ain’t frightened</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She might have twigged me and Dagon are playing dumb.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzNlYzQ1MjU5ZjQ2YTdiOTM5MWM2YWI0Y2I2NzNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anathor and I think she might be a Speaker.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTU5YTE1MTk1YTQzMGI5ZTYyNDA3NDczNjY1MzQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain!” Tomes blurted out, starting to move back, pulling out his firearm, only stopping when Serena grabbed his arm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWU1ZWNhODA4ZDQ1NjdiNzhjZWIwMDAxZWQzZGIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” she hissed. Tomes was one of the smartest soldiers she had ever had the privilege of commanding, but he always had a blind spot in rationality regarding his sworn battle-brother, Dagon. “She hasn’t done anything yet, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTQ4NjNkNGY0ZDQwYWM5YWE3ZTdkNmFmOWEwMTg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomes didn’t look back at her; instead, he focused on the human in the cell. “Not yet. Captain, if she can </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speak</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> then those chains and bars aren’t going to stop her.” Tomes's eyes widened as he faced her, his face going white. “Seven hells, Captain! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">The munitions</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmUxOTYxOTE4NTRiMTRiNGMyMWJiZTQzYzYzNTU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Below this deck was the munitions hold, where several thousand four-inch shells lay sitting, patiently waiting to greet the Republic with their fiery tidings. They were sailing heavy in anticipation of the upcoming bombardment, but this preparation was a double-edged sword, and an unknown human Speaker added a domain of risk Serena never thought she would deal with on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODhkN2E1MTQ2ZDQ2OTBhOTRjMDkyMjIyY2VmNzgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, what was the ship doing, allowing that human onboard?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzFkMzZhYTJlOTRjZmVhMzc4MWU5MjI3YjU3MGQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have Anathor directing the crew. We’re moving them as we speak. The deck armor is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">strong,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Tomes. Besides, she’s indicated she’s from a healing branch. If she only knows the First-Word from one of those, we'll be fine.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzAxN2RjMmQ3ODRmODBiMGM0NGZjMmEzMGNkM2M1"><span style="font-weight: 400">If Serena had to Speak, her martial Word would dominate the human’s healing one.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2NhMzBjMGQxODRhMzY4OTZhMWI5ZTJjYTNiNGY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomes was silent for a moment. “Anathor told you she could cast a defensive spell, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjUwMDAzMWRjYzRlYzk5MTkzZDNkZjdjMTE2NmM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. A ward-spell. She probably cloaked it so…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjkyZmZhMDEzNDRlMjZhNWY5MTQ4ZWI4NzNmYTFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So we can’t just shoot her in the head when she's distracted?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTMxNzc4MzdkODQ2YTY5ZGRkOGQ4NzgzZDk4YTVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Afraid not, and believe me, Tomes, if she’s a danger I’ll do what needs to be done to protect this crew, but…” She trailed off, causing Tomes to look at her with a quizzical expression. “…Remember, the ship </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">spoke </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">to Anathor; it doesn’t consider her a threat.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmNmYTU3ZDNjODQ0YWFhODllZDRhMDliYTg2NWQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is he sure he understood the ship correctly? It’s not exactly speaking modern Imperial to us, is it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmQ4NzM5YmRkOTQwYWRhNGEwOTgyYjFlMTIxY2E4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He seems confident.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzJkMTNlMWM0ODQ3YjRiOWE4OGFhMjk4ZjRiYmI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, ship hasn’t done us dirty yet, has it?” Tomes removed his spectacles, cleaning them with a bit of cloth before putting them away. He shrugged his shoulders and sighed. “We about to get friendly with a human Speaker then, Captain?”</span></p><span class="cmQ5NTRlYWUyYzZkMDQ1Y2U5ZTQ3NjQ4NDA0N2YwOTMw"><br/>Help support creative writers by finding and reading their stories on the original site.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4NmYwYzY5YzRmNzQ3YzQ4OTJjN2JhZDVjNjQ5OWRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt herself grimace. “I’d rather not, although I have a gut feeling.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTVhMzBhMzhhMDQ4ZjA5ZTQ4ZWIwZWYzODcxN2Iz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A gut feeling?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDQ3ODg1ZjUzZTQxMjQ4ZTJkY2Y0YTNmNzlhY2Zh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That she might be... alright.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWRmZjgzMDEwNzRlZDQ5NzM0NzMzY2FmYjI5YTk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s instincts - honed by years of war and enhanced by her divine communion - hadn’t failed her yet. Beyond that, a mad idea was growing in her mind. For some reason, the more she thought about it, the more it grew. If, and it was a big </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">if</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> - </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">if</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the human wasn’t a threat, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">if</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she really was a healer…</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTk2M2JjOTI3ODRlNGM4NzM4M2VjMzlkY2NkNmZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be an unbelievable boon to her crew, propelling their combat efficiency skywards.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzAwODU4MzUyMDQ4M2Q4M2ZlYTI4OTRiYzhjMTM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomes shook his head. “Korvus will never accept that. He’ll try to kill her.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTMwNGJjNTU4YTQzYzA4MDU5MTBlZjYyOGJiNWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anathor is keeping Korvus distracted. I don’t want him knowing of her existence until the battle ends.” Korvus was almost certainly going to be a problem. If she wasn’t a Speaker herself, then controlling her best stormtrooper would be impossible.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2U3MzU4NDgwMzQ1YTU5ZmNhMWI1NDU0NzRkZDQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How are we approaching this? We got a plan to find out if she’s a Speaker or not?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTQ0MjlhNGI0NTQ5YzQ5MTQ0YTQxODQzNzM0ODAy"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> not </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">we</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. You and Dagon will go help move the rest of the munitions. If things go bad, you won’t be able to help in a fight between Speakers. As for the method…” Serena’s hand went to her pocket, her fingers delicately touching the small box she’d collected from her quarters. “I’ll just ask her,” she said with a tone of finality.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWYwZTg0OWZiYjQ4MjM4YjQ4OGQwZDU1YjgyYjhi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If she says no?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmE4NjgwMjBjZjQ5YjU5ZmQyYzkwNTU5N2Y5MGQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll stab her proportionally to how smug she’s being. Find out if she’s really a healer.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTA2ZTlkNTJlNTRjYjU5YWU2ZDgwZGI5YWIxYjA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If she says yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTg0M2Q1MjFkNjQ0NGRiMzRkZDhjMjVmOGVjMDAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Might just stab her anyway.” She clicked her tongue. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWFhMzZjZDVkNzQyZTZiMjk0MTM0MTZjOTNjMGVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena walked back to Dagon who seemed to be recounting the tale of when she’d hung some thieves that were selling off cargo behind her back. Those thieves, who had been demon mercenaries she hired, seemed to have been replaced in Dagon’s retelling as a band of human women.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDM4OTU0YWMwZDRiMDU4OTVlZjY2MmMxZmNiZGU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“…And then, the cap’n took a fire poker and heated it until it was as red as the Red Moon itself, and then- ah Cap’n, you’re back!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjZhMzNlZTA2YjRmM2NiZWU2ZTUyNThjYjFhOTYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your brother has a job for you. Go to him.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTY2MzQ2NjMxMDRlZWJiZGM0ZTAzYWFlZWI1ZDcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Cap’n!” Dagon hurried past her, and as he did so, he fixed his eyes on hers.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWU1YzU2YzljNTRiNzI4MDgzMWE2MGIxNmI0MWZh"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Careful</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, he mouthed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWRlY2RlNGFjNjQ5ZjJhMDNlNDU0ZTljNmU4OTU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">She gave him a subtle nod in return.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Njk3NTZjODA2MDQ5MjlhZjlkODYwMzY4YmY3MTk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena looked at her captive. This one was tall for a human; her blond hair was more golden than any she had seen before, and her bright blue eyes seemed to almost sparkle. Didn’t humans from Karligard look like this? But if she was from there, why did she speak Imperial with a flawless Centralis accent? </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWRlMTQ4YmNhZjRiZjliMDg1OWZhMTNiYmQyYzcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything about her appearance seemed to be trying to declare, ‘I’m cute and innocent!’</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmE5MDdmYzU2ZDRmZmJhOTcxNTU0NDIyY2RmMzMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The human’s button nose wrinkled as she scratched it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzk1YWFjZjQzODQ5NjA4MWYzZTk1N2RhODZiOGFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Moons, this human really pissed her off.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTdjODk1YjMzNTQ4N2E5ZWU5NzJmODg3ZTM4YTVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enjoying Dagon’s stories?” she asked, keeping her expression and voice neutral.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDVhYmQ0Nzc3MTQzMTc5ZDUzZmQ4MDljYzZmYzgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A bit!” the human chirped, leaning forward. “According to him, you hang and/or torture everyone who looks at you funny! Ever thought you'd catch more flies with honey?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjg1M2RkYmYyZDQwMTZiNDg3ZTRhZWJkOWQwNDNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena watched the woman closely.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTRjNDI5YzRhMjRlNGY4NjkzMmY5YTUwYjg3YzM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The psychological battle had already begun.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWY4ZDUwN2Y4ZDQ5NGE4MDhjOWU5ZjFmODg4ZjA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, was her captive even playing?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWUyNTM2ZDdhYjRmZGM4MzFmMjUzNjc5MjRkNTQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What does that mean? That expression?” she asked, pulling a crate and then a barrel in front of the cell as an impromptu table and chair. Barrels, in her experience, made excellent seats which you could leap from quickly when attacked. As she sat, she kept her aura red, ensuring she was ready to push it into the more powerful colours if the human did anything suspicious.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWQ4MWViZDIzNDRiYzViN2YzNzg4MGNkOGQyYTE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Oh, you don’t…” The human raised a finger, placing it under her chin. “It means you can get more people to your side by being nice and offering something rather than being forceful.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDg2YjNmYWY4NDRhYTk5YjExM2EzNmEwMDcwMmU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena had already figured out the meaning behind the previously unheard expression; she was just trying to keep the human talking. The earliest stages of an interrogation were the most risky, where the captive was most likely to clam up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDRmZWQ0YWIxOTQwOGU4ZjcyN2M1ODJhZjBhMGU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And if you’re the fly on my ship, what honey are you looking for?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OThmNzU0MzMwYzQxMmJiOGYzMjA3MWQzNTZlZWQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yeah. I’m sorry about this, you know?” The human rubbed the back of her head, looking to the side, taking her eyes off Serena and her sword arm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjliZTJlYTJhZjRhYmFiYmQ0NDU0MWViZGU4ZWVl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignorant. Or fearless</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought. The human was certainly a mage, but it was as if she had no experience being around warriors. Did she not know how dangerous it was to let an expert of the sword like Serena get so close? Or did she not think she was a threat at all? Tomes had been right; this woman wasn’t reacting to a crew of demons like she should.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGI5MTlkMGI4YjQ5ZmNiNDYwNWQzZDQ0MjJkYTUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Who the hell was this idiot?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODhhZjYzNGQwZDQ1MjY4NTkyMjY3OTVkNmIwMzI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry about what?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDcwMDQ0Yzk3YTRkMDRiZGJjYTg3ZTMzZGVmNGIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Turning up like this, on your ship. It honestly wasn’t my intention. I-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmVhY2M5Mzg4MjQwYzBhNmE0NTI5NDc2YjVmNjI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A moment.” Serena put a hand up and fished the small box from her pocket. She opened the box, revealing a rotating blue crystal shining lightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWNhY2VkOGNmZTQ3ODI5Y2MwZGI4Yzk1NDJkNzRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is an Axiom Crystal. It will record our conversation.” Serena did not mention the other, smaller crystal embedded in the side of the box, which was positioned so that only she could see it. As captain of a military vessel, she only had access to one of these and using it meant she would have to fill out no small amount of paperwork, but the circumstances warranted its use. “Now, if we start again, did you intentionally board my ship?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmIxNTA0MzQ4NzRkYzNhMGQ0ZmFhODMyNzU4MTAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NThjNWVlYTkzZjRjNGI5MDBiNGQ2YTE2NzE5NmE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena kept her eyes on the human, but paid equal attention with her peripheral vision to the colour of the smaller crystal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjY1Njk4YWI0MzQ3ZGM4MDMzZDM5YTdiZWJjMDI4"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Green</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWM3OGU4MzViODQyODg4Mzk4N2Q2MmFlOGRiOGE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Through what method did you board my ship?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWYzZTcxNjVhNDRiNDY4Y2U2NjdlMjI2YTk5YzM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWRmYTllNGI0NTRiOTBiODI2NTFlYWU2YzhmMTBm"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Green</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmQwZDE5NzJjNDRjZDI4YWI4ZTRkYTJlYmMwOWNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was she supposed to make of this? A human, unknowingly and unintentionally, somehow found her way into her quarters? Was one of the Fell Gods playing a joke on her?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDQ0YjRlZjQ2MzQyMzk4MGE4OTQzNDU3NGJkOGZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">She would have to approach this another way.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDgwNjhmMDI3ZDQ0NTE5ZjYwMzc5ZWI4YzA5MGZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is your real name?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmU3NzQ3NDEzMTQ5NWU5ZjMyYzgzYmQyZWNkYmM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia Thornheart! Pleased to meet you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWU3YzFlZWY5YzQyNzFhMDk2YzkwZDNkNDI4ZDRh"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Green</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTFkZWI2Yjg5OTQzZmViMDk0M2NhZDQzYzAyYjA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where did you come from, Amelia?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWRhMjQ0Y2Q0MjRiNzdhMDJkZTYyMjQ0MGQ2ZDYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“…The hospital.” A fleeting moment of sadness flashed across Amelia’s face. Serena remembered everything Anathor had said about the girl. She would watch and remember every word, looking for the slightest inconsistency.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTAzZjRjNmExMTRhNmI4NDM0NzA1NTc4YTQwYzYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why were you in the hospital?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWRhMTFiMDQ2MDRmZjlhZjcyZmMzNDkwMjc1ZDZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was dying… I was getting better, but… it takes many years to cure what I had, and not everyone survives… but I’m better now!” Amelia tapped her chest, her mouth forming a happy smile. “And if it comes back, I can just heal it again with my magic!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGNmOGJiMDlmNDRkYWU4ZTU5ODc3ZDljNjQ5NGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena paused. She always tactfully paused and let silences linger a little too long. This was an interrogation tactic to extract more information and maintain a perception of control, although every time this human opened her mouth, she felt like she was the one losing control.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjFlZDk0YmNiODQ2MWNhYjA1ZGY0ZDkyNTQzOTRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What… affliction did you have?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGMxNjFkN2U5MDRjODY5ZjRmYTU0N2EwZWFjMzAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chronic Endothelial Collapse Syndrome.” Amelia's happy expression vanished as she spat these words out. For the first time, Serena saw an emotion she’d seen many times in the humans of the liberated territories.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWZhMzk1MjBhMjQ4OTQ5ZDg4YWE4YjRmYjMxMTIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hatred.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzM1ZTE3OTZkMzRjYTJhZWNiMGYyZDE2NzE1ODIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">But this time it wasn’t aimed at her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjM2ODgwMmE4NTQxODI4MGY2MmRhZjA0YTAxOGY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are the symptoms and causes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzRmYTdjNWQyOTQ1NzA5ZGQ2M2E3ZmI1YzEzZTBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A spontaneous disease marked by rapid deterioration of the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, resulting in systemic circulatory failure.” Amelia ground her teeth, her fists balling tight. “That’s the textbook definition anyway. Heard it a thousand times over the years. No one knows where it comes from…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmQ3NTI5Y2I4ODRkNjZhOGNjZmE2ZWEwZjJiZWJj"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s educated</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Serena took a mental note. A noble? But Anathor said she couldn’t even recognise High Imperial writing, despite speaking it flawlessly. Even if she had been educated in one of the human nations, she would have been able to identify the script of the Empire.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWNhYTBlODA0YzQ0NzY5MTJmNzhkOGIzMTdmMjFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it contagious?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmQ5OTkwNjZhMzRkYzZhZTkwY2IwMjc2NmFmMjQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGVmOWY4ZDg2NjQwM2Q4N2JiMjg2NGIzYTZiYWU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did you not use magic to cure it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTYxNzc1ZmM5ZjQzZjk5NjJiYTY0ZmQ1OWIxYmU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It… wasn’t an option.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmMwOTI5ODg0NjQ5MWU5YmUwZDM1MzAzMTZiNDky"><span style="font-weight: 400">Questions upon questions. The green light informed Serena she wasn't being told lies, at least, not knowingly. Truth-tellers weren’t infallible; if you were careful with your answers you could give half-truths that would be reported as truths, although this human didn’t seem to be trying such deception.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODRmYmVmYTZlMTQwZTM4N2JjNDYyOTMxMDlkNzhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were cured by non-magical means?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmEyYjE4NDM0NTQwYTJhZGY4ZmVjYjE5OWI5Yjll"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… maybe?” Amelia gave a little shrug.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDc5YzlhMmQwNDRmNGZhZjRlYzdiYjVhNzRkMWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your body is healthy. You do not have the appearance of someone who has spent a long period fighting an affliction, what-“</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTE1MzQ2Yjc0ODQzMzRhN2EwMDY0MjFkOWNkNjZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena closed her mouth. Here was a healthy person, somehow not knowing how they were cured. It didn't add up. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGQxYzg3MjdlMjRjM2M4NjRhODU5OTNkNzczMmM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something Anathor had suggested suddenly flashed in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzY2NzQ2Mzc0MDQ0ZDdhMzc5YzZkOGMyNTE4NTEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her mind connected the dots to reach an incredibly unlikely conclusion. A question formed that needed to be asked, one she never thought she would have to ask anyone, whether demon or human.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzhhZGVjNzNiOTRlZGNiMThkMWM1MjIzZTRmYWJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia, is the body you are in now the same one that suffered this affliction?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Mzc1MmExOTUxZjRiNjA4ODJjODA0NGM0NDRmOTE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s eyes locked with hers, a solitary tear running down her cheek.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDY0Yjc1MjI3MjRlNTJhMzk0MDkyOWQwMGQ2MmQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“…No.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTlkMGViY2Q2MjRiZmVhNDcxNDJhY2IyMWYxMzdl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Green</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGJmNTJiNjYwOTQ4YThiOGU5ZmQ3NmI2NGIwMmI0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">A darkblade! A lifecheater! A heretic!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena leapt up, drawing her cutlass, starting to twist her aether, letting it froth and layer upon itself, the pressure and heat building up, as she felt the First-Word forming, felt it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">want</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be Spoken. Anathor would sense what she was doing and warn the rest of the crew, but first, she would seek confirmation!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzI2MjZkMGVkOTQ0ODliZjVjYjg4OThlMzZmMWY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you knowingly transfer your soul into another body!? </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Answer me</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWJlNDI0MmU0MjQ1OWQ5MDE0ODI4YjcxZmVhMWQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no!” Amelia’s eyes widened with panic. “I didn’t know that was possible!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2QzN2NhZmJiNzRmMWViYmQ4NTI1YzBmNTM1MzVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you a darkblade!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjE0NDFmMjNjMjRkNGZiOTdhYTJjMGRlNjU3MTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know what that is!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTE1NWNlZjg0OTQwNjQ5M2M3OTA3OTZiMzRlOWI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you follow the scripture of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Anathema</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!? Are you a heretic!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDAxNGEzNDc3MzRhZWM4MGY4ZWFjMTZkY2E3ZDQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!” The human threw up her hands, which almost made Serena reflexively attack. “I’m not even religious! Will you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">calm down!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Stop being so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hot-headed!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> You’ll blow us out of the sky if you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speak!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmVmODRjOWY0NzRhNzU4MjhmNzk2MzU0OWQzNzQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia was glaring at </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> now.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWIyZDgxMmEyZjQwNzJhOGU0OTY0YmRlOWY0NTA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">They stared at each other for a few seconds. Serena clicked her tongue. Damn this entire situation! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">was this human? Why did she look upon her as if she were… a friend admonishing another friend?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDZhMmE5NDk1NzQxZTBhYWIwMGYwMWI3NzUxOWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia, do you plan any harm upon me, the crew, or the ship?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDk4ZmRjNTY1YzQ0MWY4Y2YxZDk4YmQyOWNkMzVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTQwYjAwNmQ3MzRmYmNhZDhkYjdjNDUzNDVmMTcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though we are of demonkind? Waging war against the rebellious Republic?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGNjNjM3ZTMxMjQ5ZjRiYmVmMjIyOTI4YjlhMTgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I like demons!” Amelia shouted as if declaring some important, long-withheld news.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGM2OWU0ZDM2MDRhY2M4NzFkZTYzODU3NDhhMjU0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Green</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTMxMjA1YjEwYjQ3OGY4MDY3YTJhZTJmMjMxMDc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzA0YjcxNTJmZDRlNDU5NjQ4NzZkNjVjNGQ3MWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt herself blink twice at that. She slowly sheathed her sword, sitting back down on the barrel. She took a slow breath, cooling her aether down but keeping it simmering, just in case.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjMyNjk5Y2JlZDRkMjU4NzYyZmRhNGEzYmFkZjgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time for another difficult question.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWE3OTExODUxZDQ0ZWY5NjlmNjIwZDQ5MzU3NDE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you... a Speaker of the Words?” Serena asked. When she saw the human visibly gulp, she knew the answer before it came.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjM1NmJkMDEwZjRiZWRiNWJhYjRkMzlhOWNmYWRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Yeah. I can speak the First-Word of a healing branch.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWEyY2JjMWFhMTQ3MDNiZWJjZDIxZDgyYzBjOTEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was definitely going to be a headache! A human Speaker on her ship right before battle! But… there was potential there. Could Serena manage it?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2ZkYWMxMGZiNTQxYmJiM2M4OTMzOWVlZjU3ZGEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">First, she needed more information.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmI2NzE3ZjMwMzQ0NTE5MTlkMTI1ZWIwYmRiMGU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many years have you lived across any and all bodies your soul has inhabited?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjJiYjA1MGIwZDRlOTdhMTRmMTc5YTA5ZGU0MDdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Twenty-five.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODVlNjdjMWY1YzRiM2Q5MzFkNWQ3YmYxNGFkN2Nh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk!” Serena clicked her tongue. Amelia wasn’t lying! Twenty-five and a Speaker! What awful talent had she stumbled upon! She had to make sure. “Could you prepare to Speak now without fully forming the Word? As proof of this claim?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjAxMmFhMDM0ODQzNWQ4MDlmZjgzNjhhOTc1MjM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, sure. But I’ve never Spoken in this body. Give me a moment.” Amelia’s eyes became unfocused and then started to shine. Light flowed from her body, brightening up the dark deck; hues of aetheric blue and gold danced from her skin, and Serena saw, in the eyes of that human, the depth and breadth of the ancient power waiting, wanting to be released.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTMxZWM1MTgxNTQ2Nzc4MTA1YjNhMjY3OTZlOTc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was beautiful.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjg1OGJkNTk4ODRkYjRiODZiNGE4YTc2NTAyMTIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop,” she commanded, and Amelia obliged, her radiant body dimming and her eyes becoming focused again. Serena took out a key. “Come here,” she said. Amelia came closer, pressing her cheeks between the bars. Serena unlocked the chains on her, and they fell to the deck floor with a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thud</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWI1OGZhNWZjZjRhMjM4ZDMzYWU3NTUxNjNhMWEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have never had a human Speaker on this ship,” she said, watching Amelia closely. “And I have never had a human Speaker be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">non-hostile</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I can only request that you forgive me for the way you have been treated. As a Speaker of the Words and in accordance with international law, you are entitled to a level of dignity you will now be afforded.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2JmYmMzNmIxYjRjMjVhZGQ5MGQ1OTg4MDlmYjM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">With another click of a lock, the cell door opened with a whine.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDE1MjZkMzAxYTQzMmY5OWRhYjUyMzBhMmE1NjJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The human looked up at her, only stepping out when Serena gestured.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjZkZWU0ZTRlMTQ4MDNiMjZlNWQyNjE4YThiNGRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“However,” she continued. “Keep the matter of your… new body a secret. You seem wholly ignorant of too many things, and that’s dangerous.” She jabbed at Amelia with her finger. “In fact, don’t talk to anyone but me, Anathor, and my Trusted: Dagon and Tomes - the latter is our bookkeeper and quartermaster and is the one you’ll need to converse with. I’ll take you to his office now.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDkxMmI0MTg1MDRjNTI4YmI1YTkzYTZiODdkM2Fh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure! Why do I need to have a conversation with him?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTZkZjE0YmVkNzRlOGFhNjBmM2U0OTIzZTFlM2I2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…” Serena said, peering down at Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDc5ZTgyZDExNzRhMDRhM2IwOGVhMjU0MGQ4MmQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The human had already offered her services, hadn’t she?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODEwMDgyNGU4ZDQ0NWVhZjkzYzJkNmQ5ZjRjYzEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For salary negotiations, of course.”</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNhZDFhM2RjNjYwOTRjMmRiNzkzMDA4ZGM4M2U3MGEx"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNlNDVmZmE5NTI5NDRlMDdiOGY1YzhkMzVmMDg3NTgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain on deck!” a voice rang out as Serena stepped through the threshold. Everyone in the bridge scrambled to stand at attention. Serena took her position at the top of the bridge, overlooking her loyal officers.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTI1Mjg1YWFmYzRjNmFhMTFkZWZmOTg2MDA3NzIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The bridge was a cone-shaped room poking out the bottom of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> upper superstructure. It was ringed with thick reinforced windows for observation, through which Serena could see the three twin-barrel turrets along the deck of the ship. These turrets formed the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> main battery. Each one could fire a set of four-inch flak, explosive, or penetrator shells every three seconds. That firepower was supplemented with another two sets of one-inch repeater anti-air guns installed lower down on the sides of the ship. One portside and one starboard.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2VhODYyMzMxYzQzN2Y5MmFmYTViNWI3OTI5OTM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was classed as a light cruiser, but under Serena’s command, making use of the ship’s unique aspects, she was able to make it punch well above its weight.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTM4MzhhOTE1ZjQ2YjM5ZTJlZjkwZGZhYjhiN2My"><span style="font-weight: 400">To her left and right were the port and starboard observation posts. These small rooms jutted out over the ship's structure and allowed direct observation of the sides of the ship. There were two more underhull observation pods at the front and rear whose occupants would pass information through speaking pipes to the officer on duty.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjQwZTAxZGRkODQ2YmQ4NzZlNjcxYTY0ZTQ1OTVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The bridge had three elevations. At the highest was her station, the helmsman’s wheel and the first officer’s position who, along with her quartermaster, were currently preoccupied with a certain bundle of blond hair and irritating bouncy energy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTJmZWM2OTBhODQwZGQ4NmZkNzNiNzZkM2RkYWE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The middle elevation was a larger space, ringed with desks manned by her most important staff. Here, the navigator, communications officer, sensors officer, weapons officer, and chief engineer all worked as a well-oiled machine. Centered on this elevation was a large table on which a small model of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> lay propped up next to maps of their target – Port Highwind. Leaning over this table, moving pieces from here to there, were her air and ground tacticians, doing what they did best: planning and arguing with each other.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTNhYTZlZmI3MzQxMzk4MDFjNTcxNjA2ZTkxOTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">During combat, these tacticians would, as best they could, keep this representation of the air space updated with the locations of enemy ships, and the maps updated with the movements of her stormtroopers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzkzM2YzMzIzZTRjYWY5ZWMzY2U1YWRlN2E2MWQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">At the lowest level were the lesser officers and subordinates of her key staff. They manned a semicircle of a dozen desks from which they could communicate with areas around the ship, prioritizing and passing information to their superior officers, who would either handle it themselves or pass it onto her or her first officer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmQzYjljOWE4YTQxMDdiOTBiYzc5NjI3MmQ1ZWRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“At ease,” she intoned. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTYzYzFhMWMyNTRiNTU5YzUyNzJlYjJlOTE2OWRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ship’s crew resumed their work, while Serena took a moment for herself. She wanted some time with her thoughts before the upcoming engagement between the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and Port Highwind’s defenses.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjQ3NWNmMjVjYzQyMTU5ZjQ5YzU5YmU2M2E5MDAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia had been left in the capable hands of Tomes and Dagon, who seemed reluctant to let his brother be alone with her. Serena had given Tomes a rundown of where she and the human Speaker currently stood with regards to potential employment. Incorporating her into the crew formally was out of the question, Tomes had reminded her as much, stating it could even be considered an act of treason. Hiring her as a mercenary was equally dubious, and despite her station giving her far more freedom than other captains, Serena still had her superiors to obey and regulations to follow.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGQ3MmQzZjFiZDQwZDZhOTA4MzdjYThlNTc4ODRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The best solution Tomes had come up with would be to contract Amelia as part of her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">personal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> retinue, as an adviser and, well, as a maid. Serena did have the right and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">technically</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it did not conflict with her military obligations, but it was pushing the boundaries right to the edge.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODkxYTZmODEwYjQ0NTliNjZkNzIzNjBlMGMxMGRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Regardless, she would still risk it despite the future problems that would inevitably arise. Demonkind had no gods of healing to learn from, so, unlike the human nations, they were more or less devoid of magical means of healing. A warrior's aura and mage's wards could accelerate the natural healing process, but they couldn’t regrow limbs like human magic could.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmFiMGQzMWRjNDRjOGNhNDJkYzJlMWIyODE4MTgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">To find, then, a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that was not only a Speaker of a healing branch, but also who seemingly lacked the knowledge of the recent racial conflict between their two species was something she previously thought impossible. To then stretch those odds even further and discover that this human appeared to have a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">positive</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> opinion of demonkind was almost beyond belief.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWZhODEyYmE2NDQzOTg5MmZmNzExMjM5ZjE5ZDQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The force multiplier Amelia would bring could not be overstated. The average non-recoverable casualty rate of her stormtroopers on a given mission was twenty percent. Five percent would die during the assault, while the remaining fifteen percent were a mix of missing in action, those who would die on the operating table, or those who recovered but were unable to return to combat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzdlOWJlMzNhODQ2NGQ4NTVhYmI2YWMzZjUwYmI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if the human could bring that twenty percent to only ten percent then the combat effectiveness of her command would skyrocket. The savings on recruitment, training, and logistics would not only help their purse strings but allow them to focus more on training specialized soldiers and build stronger cohesion in the ranks.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzFhYTgxNzg0NzQ5ZDNiNDY5YmY1OTgwNWFhMzMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">if</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she could employ Amelia. Serena had to be thorough and there were many things left unchecked. She hadn’t had nearly enough time to cover all the topics of discussion she’d wanted. Where was the human born? Who was her family? How could she speak Imperial but not write it? What other spells could she cast? And…</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzUyZTJjMTY3MzRhMDU4Njk5MmM2YmVkNTFjNTky"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">How did she get so strong?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhMmQwYjU0NTFiNjQwYTJiNWYxNGI1ZWI0ZjhhMTVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">With any luck, the answer to these questions would be getting teased out of her by Tomes and Dagon at this very moment. This time, with honey and sugar, as opposed to chains and dark cells.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjI4ZTRlY2I5NzQyZmVhM2M3ZjUyMzI4MTY4NGRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain?” a gruff voice piped up, breaking Serena from her thoughts. It was Anathor, this time speaking through a mounted stuffed windlizard. Anathor didn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">need</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a mounted head to speak from, he could do it from almost any part of the ship's structure, he simply preferred to talk through them as, apparently, it felt more </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">natural</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. "We're at the pre-appointed time," he said.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjhhZDljMWVlZjRmOTE4ZmE4NzI4N2Y2YTc2NWUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Navigation! Status!” Serena commanded, pushing Amelia out of her mind. It was time to focus.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzQ1ZjFmNDc2MzQ5NDNhYjU4OTFjMDI5ODE4NGI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thirty-two knots! Bearing twenty degrees from north! Two thousand three hundred meters!” the navigation officer yelled out, reading the values of the pitot-static instrument in front of him. “Five klicks 'till we’re within aetherscope range, Captain! Ten klicks 'til we're horizon-visible!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTNiZGQ0NjFlYzRlMGFhNzg3MjcwNjI2NTk3MDg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were sailing low, just over two klicks above the lumina boundary. Port Highwind sat on an island almost as low, allowing them to get far closer than normal before they were within visible range of the port's watchtowers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDBiMTZkOGRmNjQzMGY4NDVlNGNhZTdkOTk0OThj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensors! Report!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGYyMGMyODM1MDQ2YTM5NmRiNTI2OTcwM2FiODNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No blips! Low-level lumina noise! Aetherfield clear!” the sensors officer shouted. Even with being over two klicks away, the lumina caused interference with the aetherscopes that ringed the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was these devices that detected the aetheric combustion of a ship’s lift engine and served as an early warning system where and when their observers’ eyes failed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDgyY2EwNGEyYzQ4ZmI4ODdjNTE5OWJiNjEwMmRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The interference was why ships, military and civilian alike, avoided sailing low. Instead, most battles and travel occurred in mid- and high-sky. Get too close to the lumina boundary, and the noise would render your ship’s instruments useless. Sail </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">into</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the lumina, and the aetheric combustion would catastrophically chain-react and destroy the ship.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2Q2MjMyNDJlMTRiM2FhOGVjNjE5YTk0OGZjM2M3"><span style="font-weight: 400">That is, if the ship wasn’t the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTA4OWQzOWM5YzRhNzNhNzY1MzhkMmQ4NzBmNzg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Communications! What do our eyes see?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTQ5N2NhMTY0MTQ1ZTBhOTRmYmNiYzhjODJiMzY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sky clear! Visibility good, Captain!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjIwZTJjYTc1YzQ4MGZiZjI5MmVjMWQ0YjNiYjU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright… let’s go swimming!” Serena cleared her throat before giving the command. “Pitch down! Ten degrees!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWU3OWUwYjllODQxMmY5ZjBhNmRlNTM5NmEyN2Jm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pitch down! Ten degrees!” the helmsman responded, adjusting one of the many levers of his station.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTU4NzZmYjRlOTRlMGZiMjU5MTc2OWVmZDYxNTdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pitch down! Ten degrees!” the chief engineer shouted into a speaking tube, reporting her command to the engine room.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjQxNGFjMDhhMjQ2ZWU4M2RkNWFiMTJkMWNjZjQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few moments passed, and Serena felt the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> respond, its bow dipping slightly below the horizon. The shimmering expanse of the lumina and its gentle glow were now visible as an orange blanket that formed the foundation of their world.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzMwZTU0MGVhODRlZDg4NmEwOWY5MGVmNTU4M2Qz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, it was calm today. Even commanding the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena knew to avoid a lumina storm.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTQwMjVlYTJlZTQ1YjE4MjVmMmQ2MTg1MmM2NjQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">She did the rough maths in her head but decided to have the navigation officer report it for the benefit of the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTBmZTc2MzE3NjQ2MzA5YjM0YWZlZjc3YzkxMWQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Navigation! Time till impact?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2U3MzVjYTBjODRkNmNhM2MyYmZlMzkyODcyZjEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thirteen minutes!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTJiZTAyMTM5ZjQxMzU5ODNlNTlkOGMyMjNlOTNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was little left to do. Communications would report anything that needed reporting and the sensors department would soon be mostly blind. She double-checked with the weapons officer and got the green light on all barrels. The ground tactician also reported all green for the stormtroopers, who were prepping the transport ships which were attached to the sides of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> along with several support craft which, according to the air tactician, were also green.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmE0M2NlM2EyNzRlMGU4NDdkYTI5ZWRkNWU3YWQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">She considered asking Anathor what Amelia was doing but decided against it. It was frustrating how that smug face kept appearing in her mind. Maybe if she found an excuse to stab her a little, it would stop happening. Perhaps the human would like a friendly spar between Speakers?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjlmMTgzZGYzODRlYTE5YjQxNWE0ZTA0YTY3ODQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anathor, how’s the ship doing?” she asked the stuffed head.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDhkMTQ5MDhlNzRiZGY5ZGY4M2Q0OWIzMzNiNzY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” The windlizard paused for a moment. “It’s… excited. Looking forward to the lumina.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWFmOTkwNDc4YTRkMjM4ZmE2MDJjOTg5ZTI4YWFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Where other ships faced certain destruction, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance liked</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the lumina. The ship had a supernatural ability to maintain aetheric combustion while sailing within the boundary, an ability that she, before and again now, would make great tactical use of. Serena had once asked Anathor if the ship could go even further, to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">break through</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the boundary itself, to reach the fabled </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">under-sky</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, but he had only responded with, “She’s not ready yet, Captain…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODJlMWY2YmZmNDRjM2Y4NTY1NmU5NWFmYTA2YmNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thirty seconds till impact!” Navigation called out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGQyM2E1ZTljZjQwYjE4MWViMjc5N2Q4NTUyMzRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aetherscopes blind!” the sensors officer yelled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2ZjZDg2YjhhYjRiNzhhMzZkYmZlNjY1NDdiMmI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pitch up! Five degrees!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTVjYWM0MmU3YjQ3MDI4MjM0MGNhMzFmMzY1Yjlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pitch up! Five degrees!” the helmsman and chief engineer responded in unison.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTlkMDgzZTc3MzRhZTM5NWY5MDQ4NmU0ODJmMmI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rig for silent running!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDY5MmMxNzM0ZDQyZGM5MzhiNmQ1ZmZlMWYwMzA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rig for silent running!” the chief engineer passed the order to the engine room, and soon she felt the ship slow, as air resistance brought it down to a slower twenty knots, just as the under-hull of the ship entered the lumina.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmNiM2IxODI5YjRlNzJhOGFmOTcwOGVkMTc5YWM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rigged for silent running!” reported the chief engineer.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzM1MTNjOTEwNjQ5MmJhOTZmZjJjYzQ5Nzk4YjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Under-hull, one point five!” the sensor officer shouted. There were density gauges attached to the top and bottom of the ship. They were normally used to check the density of clouds they sailed through, but they could also be used to estimate the density of the lumina.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODhlZDg2ZjNiNjRjNWQ4MmRmYWM2YTEyZWQ3MzE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Under-hull, one point eight!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTdlNzhkN2M0YTRjMzJhZjEyZDZmOTQyNTMyYjBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maintain course!” Serena commanded. The lumina was calm today, not very dense in its upper layers. They would have to go deep to ensure they were adequately camouflaged.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjBhZmE0NDU3MzRiMjg5N2JjYTY2N2Q5NDYyNzg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The deck of the ship was swallowed by the ethereal fog, and then the turrets, and finally the windows themselves.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDgzMTc3NmY2YTQ1NWY4YTA4MGU4ODE2OTEzMTVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Visibility one hundred meters! Under-hull, two point two! Mast, one point five!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzc3ZWIwYjkzYTQ1MGJiZmRmM2RiYjAyMTU3ZDdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt a moment of pride at how well her staff worked now. When they did this originally, after much convincing from Anathor who claimed the ship </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">needed it</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the tension had crippled their cohesion. Now, they were almost relaxed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjJlODNmZGIwMDQ4NzliNGE4ZDlmNmVmOGFiMjEx"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTUxZDdhYWU0YjQ2YThhYWU4OWRiMWI5MGMyZWE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Visibility eighty meters! Under-hull, three point six!

Please report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjMTE1ZDZkYTY0YTRjNWQ4Njg0MjA5NmYwMjVkNTc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, a certain pair of blue eyes entered her thoughts. Damn it all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmFhYjBlMDZmODQzOWE5NmUwYmNkNGE3NGY2M2Nk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anathor,” she whispered, “how goes it with Tomes and Dagon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmYzN2I1MjJlNDQxNjhiMzFmZTQ2MzM1ZjkwNTFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… they are playing poker, Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmVkMjFhZGJkYjQ3YzJiMDM2MDc4MTA1MjI5NWU5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">They were doing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> what</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTlkMmE2ZGI3ZDQ0NGI5ZmQ3YjZlNjA3YmRkZWUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re doing </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">what!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” she hissed, keeping her voice as low as possible.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTE2MmEzYWVmYjQ2YjhiMTI0OWMxYTUwNmYxZDZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s winning. Dagon thinks she’s cheating and won’t let her deal anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjg1YjliMjZlMjRmZjJiZTIyZWNlMjYxZTYxYmE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena resisted the urge to grasp her horns in frustration. “Damn it Anathor, unless it’s something serious I don’t need to know everything she’s doing.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODg2ZDU1YjEyODQwNjBiZWJjNjE2NDA1N2ExYzAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… you asked.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmEwODEzM2FjMzRkNGNiZGM3YTZkOGQxMDAwZDcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjY5MzA5YzI3ODQyZDNiZTgyMmQ2NDZiZWE5ZGM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Visibility thirty meters! Under-hull, five point five! Mast, five point zero! Captain!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGJkOTYzYjcyNDQ3MzFhNTI1MjgyZTRlZDY5NmRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Level out!” she commanded. Her helmsman and engineer quickly repeated the command. Moments later, she felt the ship’s bow align. “Navigation! Status!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzcyMzIwNjM3ZjRiOTJhYTcxNzI2M2NlNzA4MmQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eighteen knots! Bearing twenty degrees from north! Minus one hundred twenty meters! Sailing level!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjM0MTg5M2U0ZTQyZGM5NTE0MjYyMTIyNjlmZjk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain!” the communications officer cried out. “We’ve got cavitation!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTM5NjUyZTJmYjQwY2E5NjMwMTFhZDUyMzI2Yzg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Slow us down! Fifteen knots!” The orders were quickly relayed down the chain of command, and the ship soon slowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTdmYWI1N2JmZjQ2ZmRhYWVjNTQzZWQ5ZjU3MWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cavitation could occur when sailing through thick clouds. The propeller of the ship created a region of low pressure behind it that could form bubbles that would collapse, creating noise and stressing the propeller and hull.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTYzODQ2NDI5MDRlNTBhYWVmMTIzOGQ4NWM1OTQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Communications and the chief engineer gave her the all-clear. She resisted a sigh of relief. More than a few ships had fallen from the sky due to damage sustained through cloud-borne cavitation, and the lumina was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">far</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> thicker.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDIyNzVmYzI5ZDQzNjM5MWU4NDM4YTJiMzY3Y2Q3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maintain course, two hours,” she instructed the helmsman, who nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTEwYmQ2NGQ4NTQxMDFiNDAzZjgyZGIxZGU1MDgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye, Captain!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDBhZDI2OTZiZDRlODdiMzE4ZTZkMmQ1ZGVlZWYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Air tactician,” she said, causing the demon in question to turn away from the maps and look at her. She knew his name of course, she knew all their names, but you didn’t use names on the bridge. You used titles.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzVjNmI5MWE0MTRkYjZhNTM2MjIzZDQ2YTBlMTcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In your command,” she said to him, turning to leave. With Dagon, her first officer, occupied, the third-in-command was her air tactician, who would keep an eye on everything while she was gone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWFiNjcxNTQyMjRjMTJhYjg5ZjA0MTkwM2MyNWM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Captain! Captain leaving deck!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWE0ZmVjZTcxNDRjZWRiMTJmNzQ2ZWYyY2MzNTg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena left the bridge, deciding to head to her quarters to find something to busy her mind with. There was always bookkeeping to do, reports to write or double-check. Barring any emergencies, she would return on deck in an hour and a half, giving time for last-minute checks and clarification of strategies and-</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDZlYmFhNGNkYTQ0MjViMzVhMzBhZTM1MGRjNzgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">How had she gotten here?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjQ0ODUxMWUzMjQ1OTQ5NGE3OTczMjdhNTE3MTll"><span style="font-weight: 400">The door of the quartermaster’s quarters stood before her and, beyond it, the sounds of conversation and… was that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">laughter</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> reaching her ears? Serena reached out to open the door, stopping herself short.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2MzNTQwMTcxNzQ2YmI5OTc4NjZkYTNmYTU0MTQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was she doing? She didn’t need to babysit. Tomes and Dagon were more than capable of their tasks. It would be patronizing to constantly check in on them. She trusted them to report to her as and when needed. Micromanaging was not how she commanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDNhNjE5MmQ3NDRmMjE5NTNjOWI2NGIyZGNhMGFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at the doorknob for a few more seconds before turning away, walking with determination until she was back in her quarters. Thankfully Anathor, who no doubt saw what happened, didn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjYwODU0ZTQ1ZjRjOTRiYzE5NTE1YjQwMWE2NGMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting in her familiar chair, she felt a sense of normalcy and took a moment to appreciate the quiet. The lumina cast a gentle glow through her windows, similar to the morning sun. It might have been relaxing if they weren’t a few hundred meters from certain destruction.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzk1YjZmMTQzYzRiNGZhM2Y1NDAwM2FiNTQ1YThi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena fished around and found some reports that needed doing and set about completing them. For a few minutes nothing but the scratch of a fountain pen filled the quarters. Just as she was getting lost in her work, a familiar voice interrupted the flow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTFhZjBjYzVhMDRkNDY4NmFmNGI5MjI3MDRkODdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain, quartermaster on his way,” the moose’s head informed her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjAxOGM1N2QxYTRkYWVhOGJhZjMyZjNlYzQyYjIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And Dagon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGVjYTY3MGMwMzQwY2M4MGI2MzJmYjk5ZGY4MGFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“With the girl, they’re playing drunk demon’s hand.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTNmMDEzMzIzNTRmNTFiYjU1YWVmZjAwNjlhMDE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk!” Serena couldn’t stop her annoyance from coming out. “They’re not </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">drinking</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, are they?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2ViNWJjYjY3ODRlYjlhOTlhOGZlMDliZDQ2OGQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, Captain. Quartermaster outside.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjdjMGZiZDBkODRkYTc5NzRjNjVmZmJmMmY5ODdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">A second later, a few knocks sounded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjExZDA2MzhlMTQzNWM5MTY1NTM1YTdjNDgwOGE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come in,” Serena called. The door opened and Tomes stepped in, closing it behind himself, paper in hand, spectacles on nose.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTc5Njc1YmM0YjQzNmM5MjZlYzQ1OWQzZDkzMjVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, Captain. Anathor said you were here. All good on the bridge?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjVmMDgxNTA3OTRhNjZiZDk5MTEyNDA2NjI5M2Nm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Had some cavitation, had to bring her down to fifteen knots.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDk4YTg1Y2QwMjQ1MjhhMGM1ZDE3YTdlMTUxZWY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm.” Tomes scratched his stubble. “I remember speaking to some Ainese merchants a while back. They said some Aindo builders had come up with some new propeller designs. They curved the blades in a way that was supposed to prevent or minimise cavitation. Could be a worthwhile upgrade, considering what we do,” he finished, gesturing to the lumina outside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzRjN2FiYjJjMzQ0YTk4NzRlMDY0Y2ZmZmU0ZWY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Send some feelers out, next time we make land.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTc0NzJjNDhiNTQ4ZGQ4YTcxNzRhMTFjMmM1ZDNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye, Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2U0MjVlNGI2MjQ1OTJiMmRkZDU2M2ZjN2Y5MjYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">An awkward silence lingered long enough that Serena felt a headache coming on.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmMwY2JkNmE5MTRmYTViNjUxNGU3MTZmNzRhYmQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, Tomes. What do we have?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGM2MzJjNTY4ZTQ4OTBhMWUzN2VkNzg4YjdhNmQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her quartermaster shook the paper in his hand with a grin. “I got a few answers, but I hope you’re ready for all the other questions and impossible things that arise from them.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmE4N2M2ODk5OTRjMzk5NmQ0MmNlNzY5M2QyMzVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, why would I expect anything less? Why do </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human women</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> have to be so damn complicated?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDk0ODlmYjQ2YTRjMjg5NDg2YjQ2MWM3MDIzODNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha! That’s all women, Captain! Ah, sorry, Captain…” Tomes dipped his head, touching his horns as an apology. “Got carried away there… with how friendly that human is, you sort of find you let down your guard.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODYxMzg1M2Q3YTQxYzliNTU2MjI5ZDc2NWMzNjZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s that?” she asked, ignoring him and nodding to the paper in the quartermaster’s hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzIyNTQ5ZTVlODQwMTM4ZWNjMDY0OGUwYTkxODJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember Anathor said she couldn’t read High Imperial? Well, look at this.” Tomes placed the paper down in front of her. “Dagon had a bright idea, pretended we didn’t have chips to play poker with. Gave her a pen and paper, got her to keep track of it all, and she did. That’s what she wrote.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTM5NDJlY2FhZDRhZGNhNzViMjdhZjZmYzc3MTkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena peered down at the paper, which contained neat and organized letters of a foreign script.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmRiMjExMzExYzQ1Njk4NDVlNjgxM2FiYzFiZGNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“First,” Tomes said, “given the quality of the writing, that human has to either be highborn or born into wealth. She’s definitely educated. The words she uses, and her lack of slang... She ain’t some alley-rat.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzlhYjM3YTVkMjRlNDlhNjkzNTk4NjliOTJhMDM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“These letters… and numbers… I feel like I’ve seen them before.” Saying that, she became certain. She had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">definitely</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> seen this before. She raised an eyebrow at Tomes, who walked to one of her many bookcases and brought back a small black book, embossed with a golden upside-down cross.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWQ3MzU0ZDJhODQ5ZDlhNmFjOWNmM2MyNjgzYWU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Bible?” she asked, eyeing the familiar book. “That’s in High Imperial, though.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTRlM2M0NTUxNjQ4ZWQ4YzYzOWE5NWIxMTYwZmYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomes placed the holy book on the desk and opened it. Its many thin pages fluttered until the front of the book was reached. “Here,” he said, pointing to the page. “Read this.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTY3NWViMjI0MjRjMzNhNjg2MGEyODA2MGY5MjYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the year of divinity, eight hundred and twenty-six, we, the Imperial Printing Press, are honored to produce this printing of the Holy Demon Bible, translated in whole by the Imperial Cathedral, with assistance from the Centralis University, from its original </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Anglish</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…!” Serena felt her eyes go wide. Anglish! She knew she had seen it before, embossed and etched into the stone tablets at the Cathedral of Bone!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmU3MDQ2ZDIxNTRjMDVhNjk2YzQ0ODY1NDQ3MmY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">A holy language.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjc1MjIxMTQ1MzQ2MDY5MzczMjMzODQzODkyYjdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">A </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">dead</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> language.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODM0YzdjYzQwNzRmNzNiNjAzYzM1MjcwZTQ5NjBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomes,” she said, this time not being able to resist grabbing her horns in frustration. A habit from her childhood. “What does this even mean!? Is she a member of the Human Church? A human saint?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWZmNzQwZmRkYTRiMGU4NWFlNWYwYzM1M2I5ZDUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You told me she said she wasn’t religious, right?” The quartermaster looked at her with a sympathetic look. “Don’t worry Captain, it gets worse. Anathor?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWE4MmM0OGQxODQwNjdhMDdkYjEzMTgzM2ZlZTVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” came the rough voice from the moose. “It’s not quite Anglish, Captain. It’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Old Anglish</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the proto-language the original human Bible was written in, telling of the great demon of Good, Speaker of a Thousand Words... Christ himself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjFjOWI5ZWIzNjQ3ZTRhY2Q5YWU2ZDM3MmUyY2Vh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn right,” said Tomes, “when I twigged it was Anglish I asked her why she wrote in that language, and get this, Captain: she looked at me like I asked something dumb and said </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">it’s what everyone wrote in and spoke, where she’s from.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDk1MGQ0ODFlZDRhYWI5NTc0NGE0NmFlOGE2MTM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena put her head in her hands, letting out a muffled groan, which didn’t stop Tomes from continuing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2M4ZWFkZDAzMTRjMzE5ZGVkYjhkMzEzNWFjNjYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Which means, Captain, if she’s telling the truth, she’s either from some secret sect, some nation from one of the distant continents, or she’s from another realm.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGM3M2U4MmM5YjRhZWI4MDJlNjU5MWQ1NmI4Mjgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s certainly not a native of Cascadia…” Anathor chimed in.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWU2MDE0ZjNhZTQxODFhZWZhYjQ0ZTkwZDc1ZjVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why can she speak Imperial!? She speaks it perfectly!” Serena was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">just</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> able to resist throwing her hands up in frustration, having regained a little bit of control. “Could it be… a blessing?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTA1OGMxYzEwYjRjNDc5ZmU5MGVjMzRjMjQ0YWI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye, a blessing.” Tomes nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGZmOWI2NDg5YjRmMzRhZDJlZGY2YTc2ODM4NWRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fell gods, and even some of their more powerful servants, could bequeath blessings upon those worthy. Blessings took many forms, but generally either gave an ability to an individual, or enhanced one they already had. A language was certainly possible.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjExODdjNTQ4YzRkY2E5NDUxNzY0NWZhNDFkYWI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Alright,” Serena said, “theory time. One of the fell gods, or some powerful entity from the mists gave this human from a land far away the blessing to speak Imperial. They then either realm-shifted or otherwise transported her into my quarters… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">for what purpose?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Serena intentionally left out the tidbit that Amelia had changed bodies. That was the type of secret she wanted to keep close to her chest.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzIwODQyZjgyNTQzYjBhOTkyYzcxNzA4YTMzNzI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomes shrugged. “It could be that, but then again, it just raises further questions… Why her? Why </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTkwZmYwODk5MDQ5ZjZhYzcyNzIyMDJlNzU5NTg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s put this to the side for now. My head’s going to fucking explode if we keep going down this line of reasoning. Hopefully, I’ll wake up tomorrow and it’ll have all been a bad dream.” She eyed her quartermaster. “What else is there? Did you find out about how she became a Speaker?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDVjMjQ0NzkwODQxODc5OTBhMmUyZmU3MTRhOTdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I asked. She said she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">trained</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I asked what kind of training and she said she wouldn’t say, not that she didn’t want to, but she didn’t know how to explain it without giving an inaccurate picture of events. I poked further but she clammed up.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDdlNjQxOTg3MjQ4YjliODYxMTU3MTAxYjllN2Y3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The human claims she spent most of her life in a hospital bed,” Anathor said. “I’d be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very interested</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in knowing what kind of bed-bound training can produce a Speaker. Could it be a blessing?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzkyOTRiYTczNzQzMGNhZDNlMzQzMzc4ZTIwYjVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No blessing in history has ever made anyone a Speaker,” Tomes said, shaking his head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTEwOTcyZTliNTRmZDg4Nzk4YmVhMzBhZDRhZWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We could find out,” Serena said. “The human church would be able to tell the nature of the blessing if they examined her, wouldn’t they?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzQ0NDFkYjMwZDQxZTNiMDA2NWQyNmQ1ZDA5Y2Zh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomes took his spectacles off, steaming them up with some hot breath then setting about cleaning them on his shirt. “How are we going to get a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human priest</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to do that? We could kidnap one, but then we’ll have the Inquisitor Navy after us, and that'll be the end of us, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> or no </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTgxMzFiYmM0NDRiODA5MzEwNzAwYjUxZDVmYWRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I wouldn't be so sure of that..." Anathor said softly, almost too quiet to hear.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Nzg4MjliNzQyODQ5NzE4NmQ4NjVjYzU5M2Y2ZTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena shrugged. “Guess we’ll wait and see if the opportunity arrives. We’ve already got one human friendly toward demonkind, why not another?” Tomes chuckled at that. “Did you find out anything else about her powers? She can speak the First-Word, but is she a fourth-circle mage?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWVjMTJlMzA0YTQ2MTk5NzBiYmJjZjQ0YmVkNDQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She said she was not sure and would need to experiment. Not sure what that means, but then I thought if she had a blessing that helped her become a Speaker, she could be quite new to it, and not know her limits.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDYzOGFlMmVjNjQ0MGFiMjFjMmZhYzVlMjliYjI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena found herself nodding at that. Unlike Tomes, she and Anathor knew Amelia was in a new body. Perhaps the soul transfer meant she wasn’t yet sure what she was capable of. Amelia had said she hadn’t Spoken in her new body yet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmFkMzUzODk5ZjQ3OWU5YTg0OWNjNDA5YTVkM2Nh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As for first, second, and third-circle…” Tomes continued, “she said she knows a range of healing spells, ward spells, and what she called support spells.” He took a breath. “And for all of these, she claimed she could cast them as a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">field</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> spell.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTExOGJhNDBlNzQ2NDJhNmViODZhMzc4YjA5NjFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena narrowed her eyes at that. It was more than she hoped. “How many spells can a typical human healer cast?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTAzMWFlOTBiYTQ0NjBhNDgzMmM0NDJkNGRlYmZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somewhere between four to six as a third-circle healer. Maybe ten as a Speaker of the Words. But the way she was talking implied she knew </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">a lot</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> more.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzY0NmNmNDg1NzQ3Yjc4ZGJlNzc5YTQzOTkzNzRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And her aether capacity? Did she go into detail on that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmJmZTRhNWMwZjQ4MzA4MmIxYTFmYTcwOTJhNzkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I er… didn’t get around to it. To be honest, at this point it was hard for me and Dagon to keep a straight face. You would have had to be there, Captain. She was talking about all of this so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">casually</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I don’t think she realises how taboo it normally is for a Speaker to discuss their abilities.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTJiYWU1N2QzZTRmNTNiODgwYWY4NmE3M2E2NWZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that’s in line with how she’s behaved with me.” Serena leaned back in her chair, allowing a few deep breaths to calm her mind. “Family? Friends?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTExNWE4YzUxOTQ3YWU5NTgzMWE0MzFiOTlhNmFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No family, she claims. Didn’t ask about friends.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjYyYjAxMjM2YTQ4OGVhMDFiZDZjYjVjYTYwNTNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And about her employment?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzUwMjc5MzgxODQzZjY5YzIyYmFlMGE3Zjg0YTA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah”–Tomes looked awkward suddenly–“about that.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTg4NzQwYzAyNzRkMjU4ZjM2ZjAxNzAzOTVhNmRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just tell me, Tomes, I can’t get any more surprised.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzRjNzIwZjViNjQ2ZTBhNzI0Nzc3ZDdjNmNiYmNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, she seemed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">especially</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> delighted about being your maid. Even when I used the term </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">adviser</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she kept referring to herself as a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">maid</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Talked about wanting a proper uniform and everything.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjEwYTkwM2JjZTQ4YzQ4MmI5OTdiMjUwZGYzZTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt her eyebrow twitch. Speaker or not, she was definitely going to find an excuse to stab her. Maybe she’d say it was practice for Amelia to get used to her new body and its abilities.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDk2ODE4NmRmYjQwZDliYTY2ZTI5YjFhMTFhZTMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Compensation?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWFhMjRjNDM0OTRiYWFiMDAwNzM5NzJlOGEzMzAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Offered her twelve hundred Denarii a month. Fair wage for a Speaker and, to be honest, she’s probably worth more, especially considering the fact that she’s a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">healer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She’s ignorant enough that we could shortchange her, but why risk losing her when she finds out her value? Not like we could stop her leaving.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTRjNTdiOTFhMzRmZjY4YWI2MDVhOWMwNjVmOGM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Agreed. Anything else?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTE1ZmJjNzQxODQzZjI5N2JlYmJhOTI0YWNjMTAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She wants me to teach her how to write, High Imperial that is. Figured that’ll be fine, and gives a good excuse for me to find some more answers. And…” Tomes put his hands behind his back, shuffling awkwardly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2YxYjEyZWFiOTQ1ZDA5MjE4ZWViMTIzMGNmMzBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Could headaches get headaches? Serena was sure that was about to happen.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmY4YTNkYmRmNjRkOTNhODEyYzVjN2QyODhkNTFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“…She wants you to teach her the sword. Said she’s got no need to get better at magic, said she’s never held a sword in her life.” As Tomes said this he tensed, as if expecting an outburst from her. Instead, she found herself smiling.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTRhODkzMzEyMTQ4NDZhYWFkNjg1NjQ2MDg3MmFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjk1MDUwNjI5YjRmM2I5NWRmZjMwN2EzNGQ3NzEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I think we can do that. I think that would work </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very well</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDIwMWI5ZGNmODRlOTZhNDNjMTc5MWY4ZjkxNTY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Anathor piped up. “You have that look in your eye again, Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTlmOWU3MjA5YjQ0MWM5MmJmMjQ1ZTNhZWUyMjNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What look!?” she snapped.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTA3N2MwM2JhNTQ0ZDU4NDVkNDQ1NjFkNTQzZDU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing. Nothing…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjFmNzdjYjhiMzQwZWNhN2ZhMDZiN2Y4OGI5YTIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Prepare the contract, Tomes. Dismissed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWRlZjY3ZGMwMzQ5MmM5YWM4MGY3NjFkNGQzMTM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Captain.” The quartermaster turned and opened the door, but before leaving, his eyes met with hers. “You know, Captain… with her being a Speaker… with everything that’s happened, everything we’ve seen… do you think… with her… there’s a chance?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmYxZTllNGE0YTQ3ZWE5OWY2YTgyMjkyMmIyYjlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A chance for what?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjRjNjRjMDM4ZDRjYjI4MTgyMmFlYjY4MDcxNmY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That… never mind. This old man is thinking stupid things again.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjAwMGIxOWMwYTRjOTZiNjg0NTkzOGRjOGQ1ZDNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get some rest, Tomes. Dismissed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWI1YzdmY2ZlOTQ4OTE4ZDhiODliY2RiNmNiN2My"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTczYzQ0YTBlMDRjZmZiYzMzYjZlM2FlNDU2NmVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The door closed and Serena let herself stare off into blank space. She had known Tomes for many years; they barely needed to talk to communicate with each other. She knew what he was going to ask, and she was thankful he didn’t. Given their situation, there were some questions that really, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">really</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> should not be asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGRkOWRmZmZkNzQ0MGZhYmU1NDAyMzFhMjM5YTBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">For the wrong answer, spoken at the wrong time, could escalate this war into something beyond her darkest fears.</span></p>

<p class="cnM2NjNjMDUyYzUwOTQ0ZGRiOGRiMjJmMjk2ZGUyMTUz">Returning to the bridge, Serena had been greeted by the familiar air of pre-battle tension. There was no changing plans now, no more debating and theory-crafting over maps of defenses. They were locked in, their hand having been dealt and the dice thrown.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzM2ZjFmNTkyZjQ3OWZhMzMxNmE2Yzc5MjhmZjVk">Port Highwind was an important logistic hub for the Republic, through which demonkind had long suspected aid was funneled in from the other human nations. It was the largest island of the archipelago, floating three klicks above the lumina. Despite its importance, due to its ability to act as a supply hub for the front line, the port only kept a squadron of frigates and interceptors.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDhlNGVjYWYzMzRiZDhhYTI1ZWI3NDc5OWQ1NDc2">Even that was somewhat impressive, considering the state of the war. It wasn’t the frigates that were the port’s primary protection, those scouts and light-ships were mostly there to send early warning to the Republic’s reserve fleets, which would scramble from the air-staging bases in the north, thirty klicks out. No, it was the static defenses that secured the low-lying port’s security.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTUzNzlkZWU4MTRiY2NiZmFjMDdkNTgzNTQyODgx">If their information was correct, they could expect the battlements of Port Highwind to be laden with no less than forty-two six-and-a-half-inch artillery systems, paired with several dozen lighter anti-air turrets. That heavy artillery could fire a shell over thirty kilometers and, given Port Highwind’s open sky, it was easy shooting at any imperial ships that came close. Battleships would be hammered before their own guns got in range, and lighter craft would be shredded by the flak rounds.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjI5ZGY4NWNkYjQwODlhODJjNTVjYzA3YmNiNzQ3">However, the port had a weakness that only the <em>Vengeance </em>could take advantage of; its low-sky position. Any other ship would be unable to get close to the supply hub, either spotted by the screen of scouts, detected by the port’s aetherscopes, or simply seen from their watchtowers.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWQwYWU2MDhjMjQ2MzQ4NDQzMjYxZDM0YTM5MzE3">But a ship that could travel into the lumina? It was something that wasn’t supposed to be possible, yet the <em>Vengeance </em>did it anyway, and now the ship was a half-klick from the port, making its final moves before the battle would begin. The stormtroopers were loaded and her escort frigates reporting the all-clear.</p>
<p class="cnM3Yjk1NDEyNTQ0YzRhZjNhNmRlNTU0YzY1MjE0OTFj">It was time.</p>
<p class="cnM5NTMwZmQxZGNkMjQ5ZTJiNTM4OGJiZjM0NmU4YmFl">The moment the propellers were clear of the thicker lumina fog, Serena gave the order.</p>
<p class="cnM0N2YwZmFhY2IyYTQ2YTJhYzU4NThkMWE4YzU3YmU4">“Flank speed!”</p>
<p class="cnMzNzJiMDYxZmZmNDQ3MjU4YTA5ZjY5MTBiZTEwODgw">“Flank speed!” yelled the helmsman, pushing the lever that controlled the ship's speed all the way to the red zone, where someone had written ‘Danger!’ along with a skull and crossbones.</p>
<p class="cnM1Yzg1NzY5MjQ2OTQzMjhiYzRkZGNkNWRhZWZlNDU4">“Flank speed!” roared the chief engineer, screaming down the speaking tube. The ship shuddered and its hull creaked as new forces took hold, and the deep hum of the lift and propulsion engine could be heard, even here in the bridge, as every knot of speed was forced out of them. The noise would be deafening in the engine room, but alas, the engineers didn’t need to hear, they just needed to keep the engines from blowing.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTk5Zjc3NjhkYzQyYzhiZTBkZWI0NzJiYzZmNzQ1">They broke out of the lumina like a great arcwhale breaching a cloud. The ship’s bow pointed steeply up and through the port-side bridge windows Serena could see the reinforced wall of the defenses looming, artillery barrels poking out, appearing like shadows from this angle beneath the sun.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzllMzU3YTAxZTRiY2E5YjZiMDg5MzFlMDJhY2Rl">Communications worked quickly. <br/><br/>"Abyss one, three, and four confirmed! Abyss five… six, confirmed!” Her tacticians placed magnetic icons representing the defenses on the map of the port, their position having been verified visually. Looked like their information was good.</p>
<p class="cnNmYmZiMWY2MTYwZDRiYzlhMWEyZWMyYzkxNjM5NjA5">“Armed tower at chalice one! Armed tower at jinx three!” Information flooded in from communications to the tacticians and weapons officer, who would prioritize and delegate targeting of the ship's cannons.</p>
<p class="cnNmNGExZTM5YThjMDQ1MTg4MjM4YmZmMGFmZmE2ZDhk">“Weapons free!” Serena gave the order.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzcxZjg1NjZkNjQ0MzJiMGZkNDRhY2E4ZDM0Mjcx">“Weapons free! Hit the towers!” repeated the weapons officer.</p>
<p class="cnMzYTdmZjNkOTYwNzRlMmM5MzJlMGUxMWQ3NTI5MWFm">“Launch escorts!”</p>
<p class="cnMwNDI1ZjAxYmE5MjRjOTQ4NjBiNzY2ZjFiMzUyYzMz">“Escorts away!”</p>
<p class="cnM5MDRmOTAzMTExYTRkZDBhZWY0NDc0MzY2OTAyNWU3">As she saw the six barrels turn, selecting their targets, the squadron of escort fighters, painted a deep red, screamed past. A moment later the guns roared to life in a thunderous symphony of destruction, as if the ship itself was breathing fire and fury. The bridge was heavily armored but the vibrations could still be felt throughout the steel and wood structure.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjk2YTc3OTllNTRhMGVhOTM0MDU0YzhlMzI2MDg3">A moment of silence, the briefest period of violent calm as the sound of the guns died, and then came the telltale sounds of destruction as their explosive shells found the isolated watch towers, blasting huge holes in and through them, causing their collapse.</p>
<p class="cnNkM2QyNzdjNTUyYzQ0MjRiNmU4MmZhYTEwM2FlNGY4">The <em>Vengeance's </em>engines hummed as it tore towards mid-sky. Just as the ship was about to come level with the defenses, Serena shouted out the next stage of their attack plan.</p>
<p class="cnM1NGM0M2FmY2M3MDQ0YjlhZDAyMTg4Nzk5NTE5Yjc3">“Release gliders!”</p>
<p class="cnNkYTFmYjQ4NDVkZDQ4MTZhNDQwODJiYTc2NTU3MWZh">“Releasing gliders!”</p>
<p class="cnM2MmMyZTdlZTExNzQyMzU4ZjExZjlhMGU0Y2U2NTk4">Their stormtroopers, nearly two hundred of them, were crammed like coals in a furnace in the dozen gliders they had attached to the <em>Vengeance</em>. These heavily armored gliders, as the name suggested, had no propulsion of their own and served merely to keep the demons inside alive as they transited to their targets. Luckily demons were made of sterner stuff than most squishy humans, for these gliders less <em>glided</em> and more <em>crash-landed</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTUwYzM0NzcxZTQ4MTNiZGNlOGUzNTljYjY1MjU1">A shout rang out, “Gliders released!” Each squad of troops would aim to guide their transport as close as possible to their prearranged destinations. Their velocity would carry the gliders, and the troops within them, in an arc over the walls and into the port.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDU3MzBmMzliMzRjOWY4OGFkNTIzNjY2OGM0NWIx">In reality, many of them would fall short or overshoot their targets and the soldiers would need to improvise, the ability to do so determined who was picked as a squad commander or not.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjBiMzk5MGNhNjRkYzI5ODM4ZmM3YTdlZTFkZTFj">Just as the last shout faded, the <em>Vengeance </em>cleared the defenses. The ship, being pitched up twenty degrees, meant the port wasn’t yet visible through the bridge windows.</p>
<p class="cnNiODhlOTkyMWE4NzRlYjJiMDMwMGUwODllYjlkYjI4">“Level out!”</p>
<p class="cnM5MTI2Y2E1YTllMzRlYzdiNGE5M2YwMmEzMTY3MjVk">The side observation rooms, as well as the under-hull observation pods, would be able to see clearly, and soon information came streaming into the bridge.</p>
<p class="cnNlNmIxM2ViYThjMjQ0NmE5NjQwMmE2NTlmYjcwZTNj">“Abyss seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven and thirteen, verified! Armed watchtower at chalice seven, chalice nine!” The weapons officer and his subordinates hurried to coordinate the under-hull guns, while the tacticians hurried to add and remove models from the map.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTRiYWQ5ZGEyZDRjOWZiYzUwYTVhY2E0NDAzMmI5">“Communications! Find their staging! Navigation! Get us turning! Roll thirty degrees!”</p>
<p class="cnNmNTBjNTZlM2Y1ODQ3MGJiYjFlNjhlMWFiMWNmZjA1">“Yes, Captain!” The two officers responded and a flurry of commands was given out. She intended to put the <em>Vengeance </em>in a circular turn, low and within the boundaries of the port's ringed defenses, relying on surprise and firepower to destroy the fleet-endangering static artillery. The ship groaned as it rolled and every demon in the room had to adjust their limbs so the thirty-degree tilt wouldn’t throw them to the floor.</p>
<p class="cnM4MWRlMGMyNzBjYjRjYTBiNWFkZmEyMzJlODc2YzU1">“Staging found! Three… belay that! Four light craft identified! Grid six by eleven!” Communications shouted out, causing Serena to cast a look at the map on the table below her, identifying the location. They had found the air staging platforms for the port's fighter squadron. Some would be out forming a scout screen, no doubt hurrying to return as their aetherscopes picked up the Vengeance’s engines. The rest, however, were landed at the staging towers, idle.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjViZDEyMzRiYjRlMTc5MDAxYmNjMGU1NTEzZDMw">“Weapons! Prioritize the staging! Grid six by eleven!”</p>
<p class="cnM2MzA3ZTllMzEyNTRlOGM4NWE1YTg3MDc0ZTA5NDFk">“Aye, Captain! Grid six by eleven!” The weapons officer shouted into a speaker tube. A few painful seconds later the guns re-aligned, the roll of the ship allowing them a straight shot to the other side of the port. All was still for a moment and then the shuddering crescendo of the guns sounded as a broadside, followed by another and then another, launched explosive shells into the grid square containing the staging towers, bringing them down like they were made of matchsticks.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDgxNDVhNWU2MTRiMDU5ZjkxMmQzMGM5ODg5NjIz">“Good work! Weapons! Focus the battlements! We’ll do a full circle!” There were at least forty-two static defenses on the walls, and it was <em>required</em> for these to be non-functional or captured for the final part of the plan. Another explosion flashed across the bridge windows as one of her fighters hit the stored munitions in one of the watchtowers, blowing it into oblivion.</p>
<p class="cnMwODM0MDkzNmM5YjQwMzdhNGRjNDNmZTFiOWMyMzVh">An air siren finally started to ring out, the element of surprise now lost. It was faint on the bridge but would be impossible to ignore in the port. Every Republican soldier and sailor would be rushing to battle stations. It was a race against the clock, to disable those guns before they could finish the laborious task of turning them inwards.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjIwNDMyMGMwYjRkZWM5YzU4OTY5MjRkYjkyNzM3">“Captain! Aetherfield! Three signatures! Bearing one-ninety! Two’o’clock! Eight klicks!” Sensors shouted out. The scouts they had stealthed past were returning, now in range of the <em>Vengeance’s</em> aetherscopes.</p>
<p class="cnM0YmI0Mzc0YmMzZjQ1YmVhOWNjN2VmZjI1NWI5OTZh">“Notify the fighters!”</p>
<p class="cnNkMTdhM2VjNjViMjQwMTk4ZWEzMDI4ZGM2ZDI5MWMz">“Yes, Captain!”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmYwNGYwMDBiYjQ4MTBhZjA2Mzg2N2RhZTc4YzM1">“Turret one jammed!” The weapons officer exclaimed, the turret in question falling silent while its brothers and sisters kept up the staccato of shell fire.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTkzY2IyMzVkMjRkODA5NmEzNTQ3NDM0NzJkNDNl">“Turret one!” screamed the chief engineer down one of the many speaking tubes in front of him. “Make haste!”</p>
<p class="cnM0NTBlZjU1NjliODQ5MTE4MjI0ZmE2NTE4Mzk5Yjc5">“Abyss twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-eight confirmed destroyed!”</p>
<p class="cnMzOWM2N2UyZjc0YzQxYjE4ZjA0N2M3ZjA1OTkzZTdk">A bead of sweat fell into Serena’s eye, but she refused to blink. She couldn’t miss a thing. A battle as risky as this meant seconds could make the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDgzOGM5ZGVlYjQ3MDViNzkzMWZmMDYyMmFlYzIy">“Taking fire! Starboard under-hull!” A voice shouted. Something from inside the port was hitting them.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjRiZWM4NzhmMDRiMTJiOWU2NTE1MDZiNTc2YWFi">“Anathor!” yelled Serena.</p>
<p class="cnNhY2VmNDhmZDYwMjQ4ZGRiMGExMGM5ZTI0YzlmNGE1">“Holding, captain!” The stuffed windlizard yelled back, “It’s only flak! They haven’t time to load anything else!”</p>
<p class="cnNjOGVkMTM5ODAzMDQxOTI5MmI2ZGRhMDdiMWY2ZjI3">“Weapons! Get the under-hull guns on it!”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTA5YThhM2U4NjRmZDJhMzQ3MmY1ZDc4YmNhNTY1">“Aye, Captain!”</p>
<p class="cnNjMWFkMGFlNzI4ZDQ3ODBhYzBkOWU2MjkyYzU0N2Vj">Thankfully they weren’t being hit by armor-piercing rounds, all thanks to their point-blank surprise attack. A fortress like Port Highwind would have its defense strategy centered around a flak screen first, expecting to engage an attacker at range before needing to switch to something more solid.</p>
<p class="cnMyMGRmYzYxYWNkYzRmNGE4YzhlOTNjNzdiMTQ1ODEw">“Abyss thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, destroyed!”</p>
<p class="cnNlYjNiYmU2MTcwODRhOWM5Y2M0NmU4ZjUxODI1ZjQ5">“Watchtowers destroyed!”</p>
<p class="cnM5N2VhMDk4NTI0ZTQ0NDliNmNiOWExMmMzZmQxYTdk">“Captain!” Announced the ground tactician, “We’ve secured the gatehouses!” Port Highwind’s walls could only be accessed through a gatehouse, one in each cardinal direction. These were the primary objectives of the stormtroopers, whose landings would have only added to the confusion and chaos.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWYzYjQzMTgxYzQ0ZjRiYjk4YzcyZjhkMzlkMGQ1">Now, with the gatehouses secured, they would own the walls, and with it, the port.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTkyMDc0MjI3NjQ1N2JhNTg4NGY5MjI1ZGYyMGU2">“Deck cannons! Ceasefire! Tell the troops to take the walls!” She gave the order. No need to destroy the remaining artillery if they could capture it. It was a better result than she had dared hope for.</p>
<p class="cnNkZThjOTIyOWVlZDQwOTQ5ODkzNzZjMmZmNmQyYzkz">“Yes, Captain!” came the chorus of replies.</p>
<p class="cnNhYjlmNjQ4YjljMDQzODQ5YTAyOGQ5ZDI3MDM0ZDg3">“Turret one back up!” yelled the chief engineer.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzdiMTBmNjI3OTRkYjE4MDE3MGZmOGNjZDA2NWYy">“Hmm… we’re not getting hit by flak anymore, Captain!” Anathor declared, “Looks like we got them!”</p>
<p class="cnM3OGZhZjk0Zjk3NDQ5NjRiMDQyM2YwYzE3Y2VmOWZi">“Captain!” The ground tactician shouted, “We failed to take the citadel! Squad six and seven took heavy casualties!”</p>
<p class="cnNhZWJiNjI4NGU3ODQ4MWFhNTNlYTBlZWJkMDdhMWYy">“Pull them back!” Serena ordered, “What are we looking at!?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NjExMWMwZDAxYzRmOGRiMjdlMTBlNTczNmIxZGVm">“Somewhere between fifty and a hundred Republicans holding up in there. We’ve destroyed the rooftop guns but storming it will be costly, and…” the tactician paused for a moment, “it’s where they funnelled all the civilians!”</p><span class="cmRhMTc5NWJiNTg4ZjRhNzBiYTk2YTkwMjUwMGRiMDdl"><br/>Support the creativity of authors by visiting Royal Road for this novel and more.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkZjA0YWI2ZWJhNzQ2MWU5OTQwM2RhOWRkNDhiMzM0">Serena couldn’t help biting her tongue. She could order them to bring the citadel down, killing everyone inside, soldiers and civilians alike. Part of her <em>wanted</em> to do it, and some captains would have already given the order.</p>
<p class="cnNiNmE2YTk0NmJmMzRmMzZhMGI4ZmZhY2E0NGIzYzM0">But, that would make her no better than the <em>humans</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDg2ZmVkNWU2NzRiMWRiZWUwYzQzYmIyZjA5YWEz">An image from her childhood threatened to surface in her mind, but she squashed it down. Now was not the time.</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2ZhZWQ0ZDc3YzRlMWM5MjQ2MzYzYTRjMzZlZTQx">“Finish securing the walls! Keep one of the under-hull guns shooting sporadically at the citadel. Keep them panicking and from having any bright ideas!”</p>
<p class="cnM1MzI2NzI3YmZkNDRhOTlhMDVmMGE5OTU2YmY0MjEy">Several more large explosions hit the port, as stores of munitions were detonated by stray shells or sabotage from the ground squads. There was no point in trying to secure the munitions for themselves, human calibers were not compatible with demon guns.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDU0ZGFhMTBiMTRmMzI4ZjFlMjNjNWU1ZmIxNWQy">A minute passed and reports came in of mass surrendering of the unlucky soldiers that were on the walls when the attack started. Those that weren’t cut down in the shell fire would quickly find any further resistance useless, surrounded by the ground forces and the <em>Vengeance </em>circling above them.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzFjNDYzZWQ1MjQ5YTRiNmY4OWVhM2NjOGNhZTVm">Other than the citadel, a few pockets of resistance sprang up, stubbornly holding on to the false hope of a reprieve. These locations were identified and a few rounds of the ship’s deck guns were more than enough to quench them.</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2Q4ZmNiMDY0ODRhOWU4NDUzYTVmMTkyNTMxY2E2">“What about the scouts?” She asked the sensors officer. Having seen how the battle was going it was possible they would flee, to inform Republican headquarters of the attack. It was likely one or two of them had already broken off out of aetherscope range, and there was nothing to be done about that.</p>
<p class="cnM4MWQzODA1MzJlZDQ5NTZiMjA5NWU5N2ExZTEwMjFj">“Three signatures! Bearing one-eighty! One klick! Three’o’clock! Wait, they’re breaking off… Captain! Torpedoes! Incoming!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NGM5YzIwMjYwZDRhNjE4Y2E3ZmUyZTNjNjcwODE2">She swore. “Pitch down! Level out!” She commanded, trying to get the ship out of its roll so it could face as much of its thicker side armor towards the threat as possible. Torpedoes! Damn the seven hells! When had the humans put a torpedo on <em>light-craft!?</em></p>
<p class="cnNlNWUwMDA3YTc2YzRiMTZiYTBiNTUyMmEwMzY0NzQ5">Serena did the mental math, a torpedo launch at half a klick away, that gave them…</p>
<p class="cnMzODJkYTQyNjYzYzQ3YTM4Njg1ZDE0MmVkYWMwZTI0">No time at all.</p>
<p class="cnM5NGI4OGMxNDA0ZDRjNDlhMmQ5NTg1ZTVmNDA1YTVh">She saw, eyes widening, as the first torpedo flew past the front deck, and a moment later the left side of the deck was engulfed in a tremendous explosion as another one slammed into the ship's armor, ripping through it like paper, throwing out blue flame and light that, for a moment, blinded her vision.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTFjY2Q3MWRiZjQzYmZhNmQyNWJhZDMwMWU4ZWMy">Serena was thrown to the deck, the shock wave too much, her ears ringing from the deafening sounds. It didn’t end though, as the explosions kept coming.</p>
<p class="cnNlOGEyYWJiZjcyYTRkNmE4NzkwMjEwY2VhNmMyZmU0">“Secondaries!” a voice cried out from somewhere in the bridge, almost too faint to hear, as another huge explosion ripped turret three from the ship's structure, flipping it through the air like a coin, its munitions detonating catastrophically.</p>
<p class="cnM2NjA1OGM2NTIzMDQ2YmRhNDJjMDM0MGJkNjA3NDhi">An alarm rang out. Anathor was saying something but she couldn’t hear him.</p>
<p class="cnNhZWIwOWY5MWFiMzQ0NGM4MDFmZGQ3ZDc1ZjI5N2M5">The helmsman was on the floor, in a daze. Seven hells! Serena gritted her teeth, forcing herself to her feet, and grabbed the helmsman’s station. She turned the ship, trying to rotate it so the damaged armor wasn’t vulnerable to another hit.</p>
<p class="cnNkMjJlZDZiNzI5MzQ1ZjI5YzUwZjM5YzA4M2MxZGMw">If the <em>Vengeance </em>was a battleship, it would be too slow to respond, but it was a light cruiser with its engines running hot, and thankfully the torpedo had hit near the bow of the ship and not the engines. It responded quickly, and as Serena turned the ship she saw, through the smoke and fire on deck, two of the enemy fighters had been shot down with the third being chased by the escorts.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTMwYzYxZGU5YTQ3ZmJiZDg2Y2EzMzY2ZWNhNDhh">“Damage report! Anathor!” Her hearing was slowly returning.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWYxZDQ0NDM0ODQzZWM5ZDEzNzAxNWFlN2RkM2E1">“Captain!” The guardian of the ship cried out. “<em>We</em> closed the bulkheads! <em>We</em> stopped it chain-reacting to the other turrets! <em>We</em> have fires to put out! Decks one, two, three, and five! It’s a big hole! What the hell was that torpedo!?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjEyZGQwZDE2ZjRhMWZiMDFlNjQxMWE0ZjE3Y2Ex">During times of crisis, Anathor would speak like this, using the term <em>we</em> to refer to himself and the ship. Serena didn’t quite know if she should treat the ship as a person or… something else.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGZhYmJhNWE0NzRjODE5ZWI5ZGZlNjIxZTk5YmVk">“Well done!” She shouted, “…casualties!?”</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2U1ZjFmYTljMjQzOTA5OWJhYWI1ODQ4ZjY5ZWE2">“Dead gunners, dead engineers, Captain! We have wounded! Two dozen sailors, maybe more!”</p>
<p class="cnNmZjRjNjFhNGExMDQzZjZhODI2OWVlNmNjN2Y4YzY3">“Tomes and Dagon? The girl?”</p>
<p class="cnM4M2IyYzM4ZmMzYjQ4ZWFiNjJjZWE4YTQ4OGFhOTcx">“They’re fine! Took a knock on the head! She’s healing them up… oh… what kind of <em>magic</em> is that…”</p>
<p class="cnM1NmRiNmVlODI1YTQwYTQ4NmU1MWI1NTA3ZDkyMTMw">“Get Dagon here! Keep Tomes and the girl there! I won’t risk her till we have the all clear!”</p>
<p class="cnNlZDhlM2RhMzUyYzQyYWJiMmJiY2MzNDVkNzIzMTNk">“Yes, Captain!”</p>
<p class="cnM1NWJlNjg2MjBjMzQ1ZWU5NzdlZjZkZTdlZjQyZTBm">A flash in the distance and Serena saw the final enemy fighter go down. <em>What the hell was that torpedo?</em> They should have only been small torpedoes carrying a small amount of explosives, something the side armor should be able to handle. But that hit like it was a battleship weapon!</p>
<p class="cnMyNzM4NmQ2MDlhMDRiZDRhOWJhMTgxNDI0ZDczNWFj">“Anathor! Call medical in here!” She shouted out, seeing that a few of the officers and subordinates were groaning. The helmsman also seemed to have a concussion of sorts. “Only a few, send most of them to the impact area! Get the wounded to the med-bay!”</p>
<p class="cnMwZTM4ZmZiOGMzMjQ3NWE4MTJmMDVmMjI1MDRhYWU0">She brought the ship's speed down to half, giving the engines a chance to cool. Running at flank speed, a full sixty knots would eventually blow the engines, as well as burn through inordinate amounts of moon-crystal fueling the aetheric combustion.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDFmNjA3ZmFkMDRjYjM4M2I0MmNiYWU4ZDg1NjRj">“Sensors! Anything!”</p>
<p class="cnNlOWEwMjIyOTI3ZDRjODU4MmFkMDA0ZGIyZGYxZjc4">“Negative!”</p>
<p class="cnMzNDJlNDZlZDJiNjQ4ZTI4YTYxZGU4ZDIwNTIyZTY1">“Do we still have fires?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNzk0Y2U4OGI0ZTQ3MmZiYWI1NWM5ZGJhNDBkM2Uw">“Last of them being dealt with, Captain!” They had procedures in place for fire-fighting. Buckets and stockpiles of sand were spread across the ship, and the few sailors who had a talent for the rare art of air magic would do their best to snuff the flames.</p>
<p class="cnNkNWU4OThhNWExNDQxMjc5MGMxOTZhYmJjZjZkNDRk">“Captain!” A new voice rang out, and a familiar set of rams horns on a bald head appeared. “What the hell happened!”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTI4ZDlkN2NiNDQ2OTQ4MjQ5ODY1MjgwZmNkMWU2">“Dagon! Some type of new torpedo hit us! Never seen anything like it!” She spat on the floor. “Fired from a light-craft! What have the Republicans come up with now!?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDQyY2EzYmMxNjRmZTU4MDE0MmUwMTI4Mjg1MTY2">“Captain, you’re bleeding!” Behind Dagon a wave of medical staff descended on the bridge, tending to injuries and wounds. One of them tried to approach her but she waved them off. As a Speaker she was inherently more resistant to physical damage.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTI2MGZhNmRhZTQ0ZWNiOTk4MDcyNjQ1M2I1OTJj">“I’m fine! I want you to take command, I need-“</p>
<p class="cnNmZWEzM2QwYTFkODQyZDJiY2IyMTcxMGQ3OTgxZTNk">“The citadel!” Someone yelled out. Serena didn’t bother waiting for a report, instead moving to the starboard observation room and looking herself, leaving the helmsman station for Dagon to handle.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjNhNDM5NDY3NDRlOTRiNWM1NmUyMDVkNDQ2ZjFi">The view took her by surprise. The first torpedo had gone over the deck, the second had hit the ship and she now knew where the third went. One side of the citadel lay in ruins, its bulky walls having collapsed unto itself and an enormous crater signaled where the torpedo had struck. She could just about make out her stormtroopers moving into the building, taking advantage of the chaos to secure the final objective.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmYyNjZkMTNiMDQ2MTY5OTY4ZjFiZDgwYjQwMGQ4">She returned to the bridge. With the enemy craft destroyed, the walls secured and the citadel falling, the battle was essentially over.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDY3YmI1ZDg4ODQ0NWZiZWY3NjVhN2U3ZTU5N2Rm">“Bring us outside the wall, Dagon. South side. We’ll dock up, bring the injured troops on board, and the bodies of the fallen. See what repairs we need.” Serena didn’t want to land the ship inside the port, as it would be vulnerable to sabotage or a surprise attack. Instead, she’d dock against the outside wall, from the direction they attacked from, using the wall as impromptu armor for their weak side.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzU5ZDg5NDJmNzQ0ZmQ5NjI0NjQ0ZmJiNmEyYTlh">“In your command.” She ordered Dagon, who saluted.</p>
<p class="cnM0NmY4OGZhNzQwZTRjM2M5ZjQwZGJmY2NiNWZlMDM3">“Yes, Captain!” He gave her a quizzical look, seeing she hadn’t left the bridge yet. “What else?”</p>
<p class="cnNjZjZkMmRjY2YwMzQyNmY4ZTUyMjBlNzkyMTY0NDE2">“Send word to the fleet. Tell them the port is captured. Assuming the Republicans got a message out, we’ll have no more than four hours before the response fleet arrives. Our battleships need to be here before that.” She waited for Dagon to affirm before continuing. “I’ll get the human, see if she’s worth what we’re going to pay her,” she quietly finished. The fact she was going to be <em>paying</em> a human had not yet spread amongst the crew.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2FmYmI3MjY3OTRjOGJiYzg5ZTIwMzE3YmMyMmZh">“Yes, Captain! Captain leaving deck!”</p>
<p class="cnMxYWQwZTc0OWI3MjQ1M2Y4ZmJjNTk2MmUyYmYzNTA1">Serena left the bridge and while heading towards her destination she felt the ship’s inertia adjust, as Dagon maneuvered it against the port’s walls. Sailors, some injured and some being carried, passed her in a rush. Serena did the best she could to keep her back straight and chin up. A captain always needed to portray strength and control.</p>
<p class="cnNhZWIzODM0MjhkZDQ5ZjliNjJlNGQ2YWQ4NDJiNTQ3">Finding herself at Tomes' quarters she opened the door without knocking.</p>
<p class="cnNjZmM4NjlhYjQ5NDQ1MTU4MzE4YTVkNDhjNDdkMTI1">“Hello!” Amelia bounced up to her like an excited wolfhound. “You’re bleeding! Let me get that for you!” The human reached to touch her head, and Serena grabbed the wrist on reflex.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGE1NjA0MGU5MjQ4ZjA5MmZhNGY5YjFjOGIyNjll">They stood there, frozen for a moment. Looking at each other. One set of red, crimson eyes narrowed, while another a set of blue orbs, wide.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTljYTAwZjhhYTQ0ZWM5NWYzMmYxOGFhM2E1ZWZh">“Oh?” Amelia said, “Don’t you want me to heal you?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZjM1NDhkMDY4ZDQ1ZjZhYjk2MTZlYmQ0ZGY1OTI4">“… save your aether. We have many injured.” In response to this, the human made a noise of dissatisfaction, putting her remaining hand on her hip.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDRjNjMyYWJlYzRlNTU5MWM1MWNlNjI1NGI0YjI0">“Believe <em>me</em>, I have more than enough aether for you, and everyone else! <em>Now let me heal you.</em>” They glared at each other until Serena relented. Her head had started to ache. Even so, she couldn’t help but keep one hand on her sword as Amelia reached for her.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGE3NDZkOGRjZDRmMjVhNDZjNjk4NjZiZjM0MTAz">Then, a golden light started flowing from Amelia’s skin. It danced like rays of sun through clouds, and within it, Serena could see hues of royal blue. The spell traveled through Amelia’s arm and suddenly Serena felt <em>comforted</em>, the pain entirely vanishing as warmth spread through her. Unbidden, a memory of being hugged by her mother came to mind, and she felt a tear roll down her cheek.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGQxMzIzNmY2OTQ2NWRiNWVjMjJkZDA5NmU2YTUx">It quickly faded and in its place, Serena found herself reinvigorated and clear-minded. Amazingly, even the aches of old injuries, her shoulder that liked to twinge, all felt like they were completely cured!</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDMxMmJlMWM1YzRmM2Q5ZTNhODRiNTEzODg5ZGJl">Serena made a few motions, teasing her limbs in ways that would normally trigger a painful response, but finding none came. So, this was the power of a human healer.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTRhNjI1MDBlOTQwNjNhZGZhOTMxOGY2YTY3MjY4">“That’s… amazing.” She said softly.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGQyNDIxZGFjZjRlN2M4NjNiNjQ4Y2FlYzlmZGM0">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded enthusiastically. “Glad you liked it!”</p>
<p class="cnM5MDQ0YjNmODNhYjQ1YTNhODcyNWU0YTg0MmQwNDdl">A few moments passed in silence, and Serena looked at Amelia in a way she never thought she could ever look at a human. A look of <em>gratitude</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDU0Yzc0MmNhODQxZWJhOTQyYzdlZWQ1NDViNzk0">“Captain,” said Tomes, interrupting the moment. “Anathor kept us updated. A torpedo?”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTUyMjE0ZWFlZjQ3NjI4Yjc5MzFiM2ViM2Y3ODJi">“Yes.” Serena forced herself back into captain mode. “Something new.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMTk4MzFkNGM5MTQwMGNhZWNmMDQ3YWM1ZjU5NWNj">“I fell over when it happened!” Amelia said, “And it was so loud! All the books came off the shelves! Did… a lot of people die?” Serena opened her mouth to chastise the girl, for speaking so casually about her crew, but stopped when she saw, in those blue eyes, a spark of maturity and determination that was not normally present.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjRhYjJhYjc5YTRlNTY4ZjkyNzNmYThiMTM5ZTEw">“Yes…” Serena said, “and, plenty to heal. Have you signed the contract?”</p>
<p class="cnM3OTU0NTBlNDJhZDRmMzVhMTMzNTU1NzBlNDJiNGM0">“Ah, about that, Captain…” Tomes trailed off.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGJmZDNjYTM4MTQ2ZDdhYTJmNzUxNGQ2ODdjNzM3">“I can’t read it!” Amelia piped up. “How can I sign something I can’t read?”</p>
<p class="cnNmZWEzMzM2ZjQ4YjRlYmM5YzI0N2Y2ZWVmOGQwNjJh">“I will read it out to you,” Serena said, “and on the dignity of my name I will not deceive you.” Amelia bit her thumb, seemingly thinking it over.</p>
<p class="cnM2M2UyNmNkZDZhYTRjOGFhYzBiMTM2Njc4MDA5NjQ4">“Okay!”</p>
<p class="cnMxOTZjN2I4OGFhNzQ4ZDQ4MWQ0MTQ2MTEwNmZiNGY1">“We don’t have time right now. Would you be willing to assist the injured before the contract is signed? We will back-date it to this morning.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNDhmZjEzZmU0NzQ2NmFhY2Y0OWNlYWVjNjk5ZDQw">“Sure!” the girl nodded.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDI3NmNkYzFiNzQxYzNhYjk1Mzc3NjNmOGU3YTkx">“Before that, we need to find you a set of clothes. Tomes?” Amelia was still wearing the simple undergarments she arrived in. It would not do to let a woman walk around the ship showing so much of their body!</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjFhOTBkYjM2MDQyNmViNWUyZjdhNmQyODg3MTlm">Especially one looking like <em>that</em>!</p>
<p class="cnM1Nzc0NDBhMzYwYjQwOTk4OWU1NmUzYzQwNmU4NzRi">“Aye, Captain,” said Tomes, moving to a wardrobe. “We can’t put her in a proper uniform, her not being part of the crew and all, so I found this.” Tomes fished out a set of clothes. “Republican officer. Only one in her size.” The white and blue clothes were a stark contrast to their dark uniforms. They kept examples of the enemy's uniforms, so soldiers could learn to identify enemy officers in the field. This was one such set.</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2Q5OTk2NTQ0YzQzMjk4NDgzOWM1NDE3YTBhNmY4">“I ripped off the military markings and figured we’d get it to a tailor, but it should do for now,” Tomes explained.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzYwNjBkNDJiNzQ0MGVhYWNjY2M1MmRlYWEwNjFh">“Better than nothing,” Serena said, pointing to the human. “You. Clothes.” She pointed to the washroom. “Quickly.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOTllNDZkMTkyYTQ0Y2I4MDUyMWFhYzM3N2EzZGM1">“Yes, Captain!” Amelia grabbed the clothes, hugging them tight before disappearing into the side room. As the door closed, Serena turned back to her quartermaster.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzI0YmJmZmJiMTRiODM5MzFlYzQzMjQ4MThjYzdj">“Sent the message to the fleet. They should get here in time if everything is alright on their end. If not… some of the static defenses survived, we’ll have to see if we can scare them off with it.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYzNmNTlmNDJmYjQ5Mzk5ZTQxOTE0YjQwOWQ3YThl">Tomes nodded. “With the port ours… their entire flank is vulnerable. They can’t have ever expected they’ll lose it.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMzdiY2VlNTNiOTRlYWFhYWZjM2FjZGFiMDc1YWEw">Serena shrugged. “Who knows… This damn proxy war might be over by next year.”</p>
<p class="cnNkN2IyN2JjM2Q4YjRlOGNhYjkzYWUyOTFiZDRlZWQw">“An end of the war? That would be nice. Depends on what the other human nations do. You’ve heard the rumors, Captain? About the coalition they’re talking about.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZGMwZmVmZmUwNjRiN2ZhYmE2ZjIyNTkxMzQyYWNm">“Tsk! It’s just saber-rattling! They won’t commit, not over a rebelling republic.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjQ2ZmRkZmFhOTRhYTRhZWRjZjE1OTRiMGQ4ZGNh">“I hope so, Captain. I hope so.” Tomes cleaned his spectacles, and a moment later the washroom door opened.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzIxMzUxNWU4NjQ1YTA5NzM0MjZlMTE2NTIzNWE4">“Couldn’t figure out how to tighten the bloody belt!” Amelia said. “How do I look?” She gave a twirl, the neat uniform fitting her form surprisingly well. Its white and blue colors complementing her golden hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDRlYzI1MzJiYjQxZWFhNWEzNjEyOTFlMzhhOTFl">She looked… looked…</p>
<p class="cnMxZDM4NDY2ODJlNDQ1M2VhYTAxMDQ2YzQwNWFiZDZk">Serena found herself biting her tongue.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDQzMTFmM2RkNDRhZmQ5YzBiMDFkNjQ1OTNjOWNi">“Let’s go,” she said. “Tomes, head to the bridge. I’ll be there after visiting the med-bay.” She looked at Amelia. “Don’t talk to anyone but me. Keep your head down. Don’t look at any crew members in the eyes. So far they only know of you as a captive healer. And for the sake of the fell gods, don’t let anyone know you’re a Speaker!”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmVkYTZkNTkyNjQxZDA5Mzg5YTExZmMxNWM4ZTk5">“Aye-aye, Captain!” Amelia said, straightening her back and saluting, her face serious yet cheerful.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDM5ODExMzY2OTQ0YWU5NzMyOTc5MjcwNTMzNzhi">“And don’t salute me! You’re not part of the crew!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNjYzZTVmMTIxZTQyZjA5NjY0OTJkNzcwYmMzMGMz">“Nope! I’m your <em>maid</em>!”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjc2OWI0MzlhNjRmZDRhZmUzZjY5MjZmNDg0OWE5">“… Shut up.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMGQxNmVkOGY5NDQyNzJhMWU4ZDM4YjlmOGE2ODlm">They left, Tomes heading off in one direction while she and Amelia went in another.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzg0MGZiZjc5ZTQyZmFiNzRhYzc2YTFhMWVkMzAy">“Walk in front of me, like a captive would. I’m going to hold your hair. It will make it look convincing. Try not to look so… happy!” Serena positioned Amelia in front, and pushed her fingers through Amelia’s hair, grabbing it.</p>
<p class="cnM3MGNiZTFlYTA4MjQ2ODVhMTZiZGU1MGY2MjU2MTgy">She decided to ignore the strange sound that came out of the human.</p>
<p class="cnMwOGQyYWYyMTU1ZjQxMzJiMWU1Mzk1YjA3ZjlkMGZh">They walked like that, through the wooden and steel corridors, down towards the med-bay. They didn’t see many sailors, and those they did see would look surprised and some eyes would narrow in disgust but otherwise, no-one said anything to Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnNmZmMxOGZlYWMzMDQ4YTNhNzI2NDM3NGMzYzQyYWU0">As they approached the med-bay things got more busy. Medical rushed back and forth, carrying water, bandages, and more of the injured. The med-bay was a section of the ship’s third deck, four rooms had been allocated and filled with beds and sanitation equipment. These four rooms were now full of crying, swearing, screaming, and unconscious demons, their injuries the result of that torpedo as well as the ground operations.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODMyM2QzOTg2ZDQyMjk4YzMxNTA3MjU5NWRjNTVk">“Medical officer!” Serena called, and soon a demon appeared, covered in the blood of a dozen patients. Shorter than her, with stubby horns was Hillbrand, her medical officer and one of the few women on the ship.</p>
<p class="cnM1YThhODYxNTU3NTRiNTQ5NzJjZjk4YjI0NThjNzQ5">“Captain! I… <em>who’s this!?</em>” Hillbrand hissed, glaring at Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDY3ZjBiYTM1ZTQxNmI5N2Y0ZmMzYzU2MjBjMzdk">“This brat is the human healer I caught. Figured she could help us out, isn’t that right, <em>human</em>?” She punctuated the end of her sentence by tightening the grip on Amelia’s hair.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTkxOWM2MDQzYTQ2N2ZiNzk5M2Q2NGY1ZWVhNDk2">Again, she decided to ignore the weird noise she made.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGJkOGRhNGJkZTQ4YmU5ZjYxNDBjNjM5YTRlZjE0">“Hillbrand, where are the most critical casualties?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMjdjZGY5MmE4NDQ3OTlhMzk2NDNmZDAyMTFlNzUw">“Over here Captain, but Captain, are you sure? <em>A human mage!?</em>”</p>
<p class="cnMyZWY0ZTZjNDNiYjQ2ZDc5YjU2YmU1OGY1MjdmNjhh">“Rather do this than have more dead, Officer. Don’t worry, she’s nice and docile.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjdiYjc0MjljMzQyOGRiMDM2OTQ5ODY2ZjFkZTA5"><em>And really annoying,</em> she thought to herself.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDIzM2EyOGZkOTRmOTQ4ZmFiNTEyOTE5N2ZjODMx">“Aye Captain… over here.” Hillbrand led them to a line of beds whose occupants were breathing their last. “These haven’t got much life left in them. I gave them something for the pain. Not much else to do, unless this human healer has the aether for it.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNjM4Y2FjNDI3ZTQ0ZjJiOWZiNmQ2MDY3NzkzYWNk">Serena looked at Amelia, who was looking at the dying demons with an expression of shock.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWYwMDY2N2QyMDQxMjBhNmNhYTViZmIzZjVhNDdi">“Well,” she asked, “can you do it?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNGRjYTY3ZjY1YTRmZDY5MjA2NjIwYzNiN2ExZmE2">“Uh, sorry,” Amelia looked at her, a picture of sadness painted on her face. “I’m not used… it’s okay… I’ll do it. Can you let go, please?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMDM3NzdjYjhlYTQ4ZDhhMjM0ODY5OTI0ZWFhYzUy">Serena obliged, releasing her hand, and letting the silky hair leave her fingers. She wasn’t exactly sure about the capability of healers, and how many Amelia, who seemed more capable than most, would be able to heal. If she could mend the worst dozen or two, then they could take it from there.</p>
<p class="cnMzY2I4YjE3YTY2MDRjYWRhM2RiNzEyYjk2ZTcxYWRk">The human stood quiet, eyes closed.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWE3MDJhZTY1NzQxOTU5Y2I0MGYyNTU2MTkzMWZh">A moment passed.</p>
<p class="cnM3ODhlZDdiODhlNjRlNTU5YzQxNmE5Y2EwNTY3NTcw">“You-!” exclaimed Hillbrand, but Serena put a stop to it with a glare.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTZhYzBlMzZlNjQxMzM5MTNmNTE3MjAyOWVjMTJh">“Let her work,” she ordered. She could sense something in Amelia, something building. A spell being prepared. “Say it out loud,” she commanded the human. At first, she thought Amelia hadn’t heard her, but then the human’s eyes opened and she looked at her, a small smile forming.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDRkZWZmYTBjNTRlNzg5MjE3ZmUyMzY4MmEwMGFk">“<em>Third circle,</em>” she said, her mouth closing, before opening once again.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTM3ZDczMjAxYzQ1MzI5MTExZmIzNzNlMmMyM2Jl">“<strong><em>Divine healing of Aseco.</em></strong>”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDY0YmNiYjE3NzQ5MjJiYzcxN2M1MjYxNzg3MGQ0">And the room exploded with light.<br/><br/></p>

      <description>Chapter Five: The Contract</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<div><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Amelia smiled at her demon captain, feeling the aether inside her begging to be expressed, to be <em>spoken</em>. The pressure was unusual, reminding her of the few times she had flown on an airplane and how her ears would pop. Although, this pressure was across her entire body and felt… nice.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“<em>Divine healing of Aseco.</em>”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Warmth, love, and light exploded from her body, filling the space with waves of gold and blue. Amelia felt the aether pour out of her, and the atmosphere seemed to <em>hum</em> in satisfaction as it was saturated with energy. She could sense the spell seeking out the injured demons, wanting to fix them, to make them whole again.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Inside her, Amelia could faintly feel her aether reserves slightly reduce. It was of little concern though, the ridiculous base stats she’d inherited gave her a titanic amount of aether regeneration.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The last wisps of golden light dissipated, and silence filled the air. Two crimson eyes, situated under two very pretty horns were wide with shock, looking at her with an expression Amelia had come to rather enjoy. Her capable captain, being so tremendously capable and cool, quickly recovered.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Put it down,” the captain's eyes flickered from her to her side, “Hillbrand,” she said softly, raising an arm.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Amelia turned her head and couldn’t stop herself from twitching. Pointing at her forehead was the barrel of a firearm, held in the hand of the medical officer who had previously been glaring at her.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“What did you <em>do!?</em>” The demon hissed at her, eyes full of suspicion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Amelia shrugged. “What I was told. Healed them,” she said. “Mind putting that down? You could hurt someone…” She was running more than just the <em>Ward of Thew</em>, having stacked multiple defensive spells and cloaking them in turn. Keeping them up was only slightly slowing her aether regeneration.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Amelia knew instinctively that it would take far more than a mere firearm to kill her. As she was now, she suspected it was a coin flip whether she could take one of the ship's explosive shells straight on. When she was in her cell, her high perception had overheard Tomes talking about shooting her, in the head no less!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was very rude of him! Centuries of racial conflict or not, didn’t they see how awfully cute she was!? Nevertheless, it had only caused her to double her resolve, she was determined to have the captain, Tomes, Dagon and the rest of the crew view her in a positive light! She loved demons! It was frustrating, if only she was in her game character’s original body, she was sure it would be much easier.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Or… maybe not. Amelia Thornheart the demonic dreadmage was more or less a demigod. Worship was something she definitely didn’t want!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The captain, <em>her captain</em>, put a palm against the firearm, pushing it gently to the side, and as she did, faint cries started to fill the room.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I’m… I’m healed!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Praise the fell gods!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“It doesn’t hurt anymore!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“My horn… it grew back!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Captain,” said Hillbrand, still glaring at Amelia, “that was <em>third circle</em> magic, like nothing I’ve ever seen. You can’t hope to keep a mage like that captive, even if it’s <em>you.</em>” She emphasized the last word, no doubt hinting towards the captain's ability as a Speaker.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“That’s because she isn’t a captive, not anymore. I’m hiring her, and having her work under me. This human… is sympathetic to the cause.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Mmm, mm!” Amelia nodded furiously. “Demons are awesome! I like your horns!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Captain!” The medical officer protested, ignoring her comment, “There’s no such thing! She must be a church mage! A Republican spy!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“She is not. I’ve verified it with a truth-finder. The uniform is something we gave her, it was all we had.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Furthermore…” came the now familiar voice of Anathor, speaking through the mounted head of some kind of stuffed bear, with boar-like tusks. “The ship believes in her… even likes her. She isn’t a threat, Hillbrand.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Captain…”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Holster your weapon, Officer.” A sharp edge took form in the captain’s voice. A moment of hesitation passed, and the medical demon finally obeyed her superior.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“The crew won’t like this…” the demon said.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Look around, Hillbrand,” the captain said, gesturing, “they’re damn <em>healed!</em> They might not trust <em>her</em>, I don’t need them to. I need them to trust <em>me</em>, and tolerate <em>her</em>. Nothing more. Can you do that?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hillbrand cast a look around the room. The demons that were previously minutes from dying were now moving their limbs, expressions of amazement and confusion on their faces. One demon was clenching their hand, their arm having regrown after just being amputated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“… aye, Captain. I can do that.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Excellent work, soldier. Now, you.” The captain faced her with a stern, but thankfully not an angry, expression. “How’s your reserves? Are you able to do… that again? There are three more treatment rooms.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Yes! But, no need!” Amelia piped up, flashing a smile. She was feeling a sense of euphoria, an after-effect of not just the movement of her aether, but also the feeling of being able to heal so many! The feeling of doing <em>good</em>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“No need?” The crimson eyes looked confused.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“H-Hillbrand!” A group of demons, dressed similarly to the medical officer, came pouring through the doorway.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“What was that light!? The others…”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“No need!” Amelia said again, not being able to stop herself from sounding a little smug.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I did them all!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The captain blinked at her.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I did the whole ship!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“… Oh, dear…” Anathor quietly said in the background.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt="image" height="61" src="https://i.imgur.com/0ETpTo1.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="480"/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>They returned to the captain’s quarters, Serena having hurried her back after Amelia had turned into a miniature sun. The captain had told Anathor to instruct Tomes that she would be late, explaining to Amelia that it was time to <em>lock her down</em>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Serena sat in the captain's chair, while Amelia awkwardly stood to the side. She had suspected her little act of healing had somewhat impressed the captain more than she had planned, giving Amelia pause as to what level a typical human healer was supposed to be working at.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The healing branch of <em>Aseco</em> was one of the more powerful paths, boasting excellent healing spells, moderate defensive capabilities, and even a few holy lightning attacks. While she <em>could</em> attack, Amelia had decided to avoid that if possible. She would be a healer, not a soldier. Besides, if it really came down to it, she had far more powerful Words from the combat branches of the demonic gods that she could Speak.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The captain was reading over Amelia’s contract and the room was quiet barring the occasional shuffling of paper. Eventually, Serena put the paper down, before writing something on a note and showing her.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Do you know what this is?” She asked Amelia.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It wasn’t English, nor was it the Imperial script she wanted to learn. Its lettering was sharp, with many jagged and vertical lines. She had never seen this before. Amelia told Serena as much.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“It is the language of the Words,” the captain said, “a phonetic language so that the Words of power can be communicated across the barriers of language and culture. This is one of the First Words; <em>Aseco</em>. This is the one you can Speak, yes?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“That’s right!” Amelia wouldn’t lie to her captain, but until they had a better relationship, and more trust between them, she would avoid sharing that she could do far more than just Speak one word. “What Word can you Speak?” she asked, curiosity forcing the question out. There were a few candidates in her mind, Amelia suspected the captain was following the path of one of the demonic sword gods.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“The first rule of being a Speaker, keep your cards close to your chest. You are far too willing to answer questions about your abilities, and to <em>use them,</em>” Serena said, pointing at her. “You should have healed everyone one by one, with a smaller individual spell, like when you healed me earlier. Word is going to get around about this. It will reach the ears of my superiors. Even if everyone finds out that you’re a Speaker, do not be forthcoming with information about your Word.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“But, depending on the spell, and when you Speak, everyone will know the Word immediately!” Amelia protested.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“And until that moment, no one will know you’re a Speaker unless you’ve <em>told them</em>. The element of surprise can be the difference between victory and defeat. Many Speakers on the front-line constantly change their appearance, or blend in with the common soldiers.” Serena sat back, looking thoughtful. “I will have Tomes act as your tutor in more than just Imperial. The language of the Words, the things you should know as a Speaker yet do not… he will teach them to you, as far as his duty permits him. That is the first clause of the contract.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Okay! What else?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I will teach you the sword, to the best of my ability. Much of it will depend on your own talent. I am a busy demon, but will try and find time for you at least bi-weekly in this matter.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Cool! I can’t wait!” Amelia gave her two enthusiastic thumbs up.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I will pay you twelve hundred denarii monthly. One of my foot soldiers receives a salary of eight denarii in the same period, so you are being valued equal to one hundred and fifty soldiers,” Serena paused, “…but, given your display just now, we will revisit this at a later date. There is only so much of my estate I can use without permission from my family head.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh? This was something new. Her captain was becoming more and more interesting.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Family head? Estate? Are you nobility?” She asked.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Yes. You should refer to me as Lady Halen in private, and as Captain when on the ship…” Serena raised a finger, “Actually, refer to me as Lady Halen at all times. It will reinforce the notion that you are working for me, as part of my personal retinue that I have the privilege to establish as a noble, rather than part of the crew.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Halen? Your surname?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“My family name, yes.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Mmm… Serena Halen. Serena Halen…” Amelia rolled the name around her tongue. It was a lovely name, fitting for such a beautiful demon with such magnificent horns. “Serena Halen… Serena Halen…”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Stop saying my name.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Yes, Lady Halen!” A question popped up in her mind. “What family do you have? Any brothers or sisters?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“There is the patriarch, my father, my mother also. I have two younger sisters.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“No brothers?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“He died during the war.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oops! She didn’t want to bring up any bad memories. Amelia tried to give a sympathetic look but was interrupted before she could say anything to ameliorate the suddenly chilly atmosphere.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Tsk! We are going off track!” Serena jabbed the paper in front of her. “Here are your obligations, you are, within the bounds of being reasonable, to provide your services of healing to my battalion. You are on call, always, and must have my permission to leave my service or the ship. You have no obligation to partake in battle directly, although if I request it you will provide your services on the front line, where every effort will be taken by myself to ensure your safety. And…”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Amelia tilted her head as Serena trailed off.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“… you are not to provide your services to the enemy, nor render them aid in any way or form, magical or otherwise.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Hmm…” Amelia said, placing a finger on her temple. “I refuse!” She expected Serena to have an outburst, but was surprised to find her silent, looking at her calmly. When the captain made it clear she was waiting for more, Amelia explained; “I spent years in bed, mostly immobile. I’m not going to let the same fate fall upon anyone else, demon or human! I’m not going to stop you fighting, I won’t get in the way, and I won’t run off without telling you, but I <em>will</em> heal whoever I want if the opportunity arises.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>She examined the demon, surprised to find her nodding to her explanation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I expected as much. The rest is acceptable, though?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Yes!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Alright,” Serena scratched out a line on the contract. “I can only request you give me the heads-up before you render aid to humans, if possible. As for your title, you will be listed as a <em>maid</em> in my service, for I do not dare to give you a higher title, lest it cause even more problems for my estate and family.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“And the uniform!?” Amelia asked, she was <em>very</em> excited to have a maid uniform, a real-life cosplay! The captain gave her a look up and down, prompting Amelia to give a quick twirl.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“We will find something less… Republican. Regardless, you will not have to do any actual maid duties. Such things as cleaning and cooking are beneath the status of a mage of your caliber, let alone a Speaker.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“But I like cleaning! I can’t cook but… I’d like to learn!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Ridiculous… well then, if you are seen cleaning, it will only help sell the idea to the crew,” Serena said. “If there is nothing else, sign here.” She turned the paper towards her, along with a pen. Amelia bent down, looking for the dotted line.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“One more thing…” she trailed off, “where will I be staying? Sleeping?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“With me,” said the captain, “we’ll set you up in my private quarters. Putting you with the crew would never work, and I’d rather keep you close by lest you get into any more trouble.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Amelia immediately signed the contract.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“All done!” she said, feeling her cheeks go red. If Serena saw, she didn’t say anything. “Anything else I should know?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Yes… as a maid, as a civilian under me, you are not subject to military orders, only my own. As per the contract and my order, you will accept requests for aid from any demon on this ship, but should any of my battalion try and order you in some way that conflicts with my own, you may ignore it, and report to me the event.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Okay!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Furthermore, as a civilian, you are not permitted to just stroll about the ship. Most areas are off-limits to you, unless your obligations require you to go somewhere, then you will not. The bridge is off-limits, as is the entire first deck, on which the turrets are mounted. Other than when you need to exit or enter the ship, there is no reason for you to be on the first deck. There should also be no reason for you to be on the second deck, the crew's quarters, unless you’re being taught by Tomes. The third deck contains the medical bay, mess hall, and kitchens. I imagine some of your time will be spent there. The fifth and sixth deck, cargo and munitions, I can’t imagine much reason for you to ever go there... unless I’m putting you in a cell again.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“What about the fourth deck? You left that out!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Hmm…” the glassy eyes of the moose’s head glinted as Anathor spoke. “The fourth deck is off-limits to all, even the captain.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Off-limits? Even for you?” Amelia asked Serena.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Yes. I wouldn’t concern yourself with that, put it out of your mind,” Serena said, but Amelia couldn’t help herself.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“What’s on the fourth deck? Anathor?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Hmm….” Said the moose, but was no more forthcoming.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“As I said, do not concern yourself with that. You will come to understand that this is more than a normal ship. The <em>Vengeance</em> is special in more ways than one.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“How… frustratingly mysterious!” She cried out, throwing her hands up.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Amusing,” said Serena, “for <em>you</em>, calling that mysterious, <em>you</em>, the biggest bundle of mystery that might have ever befallen Cascadia. Ha! What a crazy human you are!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“In the very flesh!” Amelia proclaimed, giving a little bow. “At your service!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Silly girl...” the captain said, shaking her head. Amelia only gave a grin in response.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Captain! I mean, Lady Halen! I have a request!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“… what is it?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I want to go outside!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt="image" height="61" src="https://i.imgur.com/0ETpTo1.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="480"/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Amelia stood awkwardly next to Serena. They were in some meeting room on the first deck, and the captain had dragged in every single officer, along with most of the squad commanders.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A semicircle of six to seven-foot demons, all looking at her with suspicion. Their skin had a range of colours and hues, some demons, like Serena, were mostly pale, with subtle patterns of reds and oranges. Others were darker, with deeper grays and blacks. Their eyes were all in some range of red, orange, or yellow, although none quite as crimson as the captain's.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Their horns were equally varied. Some were thick and curled, like a set of ram's horns, others were straighter, like goat horns. There were single horns, pairs, and triples, and some demons' heads had so many horns it was basically hair.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Serena explained the situation to her staff, leaving out several key bits, she made sure to emphasize how Amelia was not part of the crew, and very much under her orders and control, and yes, that healing light that spread throughout the entire ship was something she ordered. They had agreed at appropriate times Amelia would pipe up with a quick “Yes, Lady Halen!” before zipping her mouth and keeping her eyes on the floor.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>She had been told not to act like her usual cheerful self, and try and be… submissive.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Several officers had protested, most strongly amongst them was a squad commander called Korvus, which Serena had warned her about, telling her to avoid him at all costs. The room had become heated at times, at one point it seemed she might even be attacked, but Serena spooled up her aether, leaking power and intent, and that had quietened it back down.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The captain had emphasized that as a part of her personal retinue, an attack on Amelia was an attack on her, and her family. That statement had seemed to cool the room even further, although the demon called Korvus never took his eyes off her.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Surprisingly, Hillbrand had supported her, despite pointing a gun in her face earlier. The medical officer gave a report on how Amelia had saved the lives of more than a dozen demons, and how a further two dozen could immediately return to work, instead of spending weeks recovering or being dismissed entirely. This prompted a short discussion amongst the officers, as they discussed how such rapid healing could open up a new range of strategies.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After that, Serena had dismissed them and led her to the deck of the ship, where a walkway lay for them to cross to the battlements of what Amelia now knew as Port Highland, a location they had captured in the battle just past.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the deck, Amelia stood with her arms wide, turning on the spot, feeling the wind through her golden hair, not caring if the demons in the bridge could see her. She was outside! When had she last gone outside the hospital? To feel the wind?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Watch yourself!” Warned Serena, as she strayed close to a gaping hole in the deck.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Was this… that explosion from earlier?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Yes. There used to be a turret here. We’re patching it up now but will need to travel south, to a proper air-dock, to replace it. A month of repairs, maybe more.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I see…” Amelia cast her eyes south, across the deck, to the open ocean of air and space that spread as far as the eye could see. Above her, she could see layers of cloud, and below her an endless field of orange, that seemed to glow softly.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“That is the lumina, the foundations of the world.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“What’s beyond it?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“No one knows. We refer to that place as the <em>under-sky</em>, it’s where we deliver the bodies of the dead, so they may explore the great unknown, in our place.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“It feels… weird. It’s not natural, is it?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“No, it’s magical. It disrupts aether. Even a Speaker would not survive a fall into it, although the ship protects us from most of its effects.” Amelia had already been made aware of one of the unique aspects of the <em>Vengeance</em>, its ability to sail into the lumina and not be destroyed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Really! This ship was getting more and more mysterious! She made a mental note to uncover its secrets in the future, should the opportunity arise.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“And the islands? How do they float?” She asked, gesturing to the enormous pieces of land that impossibly floated with seemingly no sense of propulsion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Tens of thousands of years of moon rain saturated the land with moon crystal, which reacts with aether to produce a lifting effect. This reaches equilibrium between the lumina at the bottom, and the lighter aether at the top, and the islands maintain a stable level, depending on their weight, and the density of crystal within their earth and rock.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Is that also how the ship… sails?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Yes,” Serena nodded. “The same phenomena, trapped and utilized by the brilliant minds of inventors and engineers. The ship has two engines, a lift engine, that uses aetheric combustion to generate lift, and a propulsion engine, which uses the same to generate heat, to boil water into steam and drive the propellers.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Wow… it’s all so… so <em>cool!</em> We didn’t have anything like this from where I’m from. Instead, our aircraft only had a propulsion engine!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Oh? Then how did you sail? How did you generate lift?” Serena asked, sounding very interested.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“We didn’t call it sailing, that’s what we called ships that lived only on the water, on the seas. We called it flying. If you put large wings on a ship…” Amelia punctuated this by spreading her arms, imitating the wings of a plane, “… and those wings are shaped in a certain way, and you apply enough propulsion to the aircraft, then the wings themselves generate lift just by how they hit the air!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Yes, I’m familiar with this, some gliders and lighter craft use that method, although larger ships are too heavy for it, hence the lift engine.” Serena paused, seemingly thinking over some words. “Not now, but at some point in the future, I would like to discuss your old world with you. I still have so many questions, especially about your technology.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Mmm, sure thing!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Come now, let us walk.” Serena led them across the walkway. Amelia had to resist closing her eyes. She wasn’t the biggest fan of heights, and she certainly didn’t want to fall into the lumina. If she did happen to fall, there were Words she could Speak that would give her flight, so she wasn’t too concerned.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Together they walked along the battlements, occasionally passing demon soldiers standing guard, while other demons seemed to be examining and repairing some of the destroyed artillery. The conversation had hit a natural lull, and Amelia took some time to look over Port Highwind.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It seemed to be somewhat of an industrial town, with many warehouses and storage locations. The buildings were mostly red brick, but some sections seemed dominated by timber houses with whitewashed walls and clay tile rooftops. This, she figured, was the residential district and as they continued to circle the port, an area that looked to be some kind of town square or marketplace came into view and as it did Amelia couldn’t help but frown.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The occupants of the port had been penned into the town square. Amelia could see soldiers bringing civilians from across the port to the central location. The humans were surrounded by demon soldiers who stood guard on the ground and the rooftops overlooking the area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“The civilians,” intoned Serena, “and soldiers who surrendered. We can’t just let them do as they like in their own houses, planning any possible insurgencies. At least, not until a proper policing force comes in.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I see,” Amelia said, stopping. They both watched the area for a while, the warm sun beating down upon them. “What will happen to them?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“The soldiers will be taken as prisoners of war, and the civilians, once vetted, will be able to return to their old lives, with some restrictions.” Serena hesitated, before opening her mouth again. “If instead, I said I would execute them all, civilians and soldiers alike, what would you do?” Amelia met those crimson eyes with her own.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I’d stop you!” she said, raising and tensing her bicep.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Oh?” Serena mused, a quizzical hint of amusement forming on her face, as she raised an eyebrow. “A Word from the healing branch of Aseco, even Spoken by a talented Speaker, is still only a Word of healing. Do you think it would be enough, to stop <em>me?</em>”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Amelia flashed a cheeky smile. “I have some tricks up my sleeve, I think I could manage it, if I needed to.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Is that so?” Serena asked, “And what tricks would these be?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I’m not going to tell you! So don’t ask! A Speaker keeps their cards close to their chest, remember!?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Huh, would you look at that? The human can learn.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Hey! I’m very studious!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“You still made the mistake of hinting towards the existence of further capabilities, now I’m thinking all kinds of thoughts as to what those could be,” Serena said, placing a finger on her lips, a mock expression of thoughtfulness on her face.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Hmmrph!” Amelia exclaimed, crossing her arms, and turning away from her. Secretly, she was glad, glad that they could already talk this casually. Amelia suspected that amongst all the demons, Serena had a much higher tolerance of humans than most.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A thought cropped up.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Lady Halen,” she said.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Yes?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Since I’ve healed all the demons, I’m going to go down and heal whatever humans I can. Would you like to come with me?”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I… see. I will come, for until you’re better trained I fear what problems will arise if I leave you alone. Very well then.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Together they made their way off the battlements, towards the first group of humans Amelia had ever seen since coming to this world.</div>

      <description>Chapter Six: Korvus the Mad Dog</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNkNTk3MWVmMGM4NjRhNjc5ZDYxNjFiOTA0YWZmYzk3"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNlYjcyYzFlM2FjZTRiOGJhMzExYWI3NDY4YjUzZTM2">As they approached the large group of humans huddling together in the square, Amelia felt a knot of anxiety grow in her stomach. It was bizarre. She felt comfortable around demons, yet the idea of being around humans felt strange, almost unnatural.</p>
<p class="cnNkODgxYjk0MmI0YjRjODBiZTcyYjI0OTRkZTdmNzdm">She figured she had inherited all of her powers from her game character, and had verified much of it; Amelia had previously found time to play around with her aether, to fold it upon itself in different ways as she prepared the <em>intention</em> to Speak some of the many Words she knew from the many combat branches she specialized in. It was a pleasant surprise to find they all seemed to be available to her, and most interestingly, they appeared to provoke certain <em>emotions </em>as they were prepared. Perhaps this was why healing made her feel so <em>good</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzRkYzdjN2Q0NjRhNzVhMDJlMjU0ZDJjMGMwOTI2">Knowing that, and feeling the anxiety in her stomach, Amelia pondered as to whether she had also inherited the <em>demonic</em> trait of being mistrustful of humans, despite being a literal human herself.</p>
<p class="cnNlNWQ1NDc1ZTkwZjQyYTNiOTJlMWYxYWNmOTM2ZTVk">Or was she? Whatever mysterious force had given her this opportunity of a new life, had built her the body of her game character, which, last she remembered, was polymorphed into that of a cute human woman. However, was she still in a polymorphed state? Was her true form still that of a mighty archdemon, and this current body a temporary veneer of… blue eyes and blond prettiness?</p>
<p class="cnNhOWQ0NzgxYTM0OTRlZTc5NTdlODU3MzhiNmYxYjQ4">Serena <em>had</em> seemed to take to her quite well, which delighted Amelia, and so had Dagon and Tomes, other than the initial talk of murdering her, of course. Was this friendliness because she was still truly a demon behind the scenes, and they were picking up on this on a subconscious level?</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2JjNjAyYjA4NjQxZDBiOGQ5ODEwNGQ3MTQ0Yjc2">Well, she could think more about that later.</p>
<p class="cnM3MzgxNjVkNGUyMTQxY2M5ZWU5OWY3ZjBiYjc2M2I3">They arrived in the square.</p>
<p class="cnMxYmZjYTIyM2MxOTQ3MDNhY2Q2MTM1OTczZjgxMjBm">The mood was, at best, grim. Hundreds of humans, maybe half a thousand, were crammed in the square. They wore either work clothes or were barely dressed, huddling blankets against the cool air, despite the sun overhead. The <em>Vengeance</em> had attacked the port early in the morning, and many of the port’s residents had not woken up yet.</p>
<p class="cnNlODczMWI4MmExYzRlN2U5NTlmODJkNTZhYjQ4ZWJh">A separate group, numbering about a hundred, had been cornered off, and judging by the white and blue uniforms that looked so very similar to her own, Amelia made an educated guess that these were the remains of the defenders.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2U3NWM4MmNmMzQzNTU4M2Q0ODM5MjU3MzBkY2Ux">Their eyes were downcast, the atmosphere somber. The cries of children and women could be heard, and the wails of those in pain. Many of them clenched prayer beads, muttering comforts to themselves. Parents kept their children close, but many of the young seemed to be missing guardians, instead, what looked like older brothers and sisters were hugging their younger siblings close, speaking words of comfort to them.</p>
<p class="cnMxYmE3YTg4OTlmMTRlYjg5NTgwYzliN2U0YTNkNjQy">Some of them would never again see their parents.</p>
<p class="cnMxOWRlZDRhYWEyODQ1ZTNhNzUxOGFkNWZhM2MwYzZj">It was a terrible sight, an awful situation that tugged at her heartstrings. Amelia was powerful, she knew that much, and she also knew she was ignorant of this world. Could she have prevented this? All she had was power. She was sure she could have destroyed the <em>Vengeance</em>, saving the port from this fate. She could also have wiped out the fortress, the surrounding islands, and all the human aircraft, preventing the torpedo from hitting the ship. Or she could have simply left, and let the battle happen anyway.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTk1YmFkNWM1ZDQwYzBhMGE0ZmQ5Y2RlYjFjMmZi">What she didn’t know, is how she could have prevented it altogether, without making herself an enemy of one or both sides of the conflict. This was, she supposed, something solved in the realm of diplomacy, a subject that went very much against her brutally honest nature.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTE4YmI0MDQ1MjQyYjA4NTAxZDNiNjMyNzc5NDk2">At the very least she could make things <em>better</em>, for both demons and humans. At least by doing <em>something</em> she could feel in control of a tiny part of this conflict.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmYyNzJkYWI2MTQ5NGNhOTVjOWU1MmM1NmNjMDdl">“Hey…” she whispered to Serena, leaning in so only she could hear. “Are you able to provide them with any medical supplies? Aid from Hillbrand and her team?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjE2OTU4MzBiNTRlMzBhOTEzMzQ1OTBkYTI2YjRh">Serena shook her head, “They hate us, and understandably so. Some small number of them would accept care, but just attempting it would cause this situation to spiral out of control.” She bent towards Amelia, speaking even more quietly; “a decade of propaganda has led to some ridiculous beliefs ferment among the humans. Many of them believe we <em>eat them</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDY2ZDVkNDU2OTQ2MGU4NGZlMjMwNTlhNGNlMmIx">Amelia gave a solemn smile. “I suppose we don’t taste very nice, too stringy.” A weak joke, an attempt to lighten the mood. “Anything I should know, before I begin?”</p>
<p class="cnM3M2ZlNTU4MWE5NDQ1Y2Y5Zjk3YjIyN2EyNGI1NTZm">“... you’re smarter than you pretend to be, aren’t you? I thought the concept of caution was completely foreign to you.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMDZlMWZlZGNiMzQ0N2JiYWY1MjI2MGVhYTNkZTQy">“So unfair…”</p>
<p class="cnMxYWU0NzE0NGViOTRiNGNiMzFkN2M3MzQ0MzNmMjE3">“Firstly,” Serena said, raising a finger, “nothing big or flashy. Do it slowly, one by one.” A second finger joined the first. “Secondly, if asked, do not say you are a captive. Tell them the truth, you are under my employment, and willingly so. Thirdly, and this is the most important, do <em>not</em> imply in any way you have any connection to the human church, or any church for that matter.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMTQ4YmM0ZDFiMjQ5Y2E5ZDI3NTNhMWI4YzdlNzgw">“Okay!” Amelia whispered back.</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2Y4ZGQ0NjQ4MTRhMTA5ZGE5NmRjNDM1ZjNlYzgw">“... and don’t over-exert yourself!” she added, as Amelia stepped forward amongst the humans.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDMzNDhjNzRjODRjNjU4MGM4MmUyZTYyYjdhNGQ3">They were lined in rough columns, with just enough space for her and the demon guards to walk up and down the square. Amelia strolled forward, some murmuring having started as more and more humans, civilians and soldiers alike, noticed her. Amelia’s high perception made it easy to capture these snippets.</p>
<p class="cnM3NWE2MjQ5ODhjMzRhNjdiMjgxMGU1YzAxMDFkYTFi">“Sis, who’s that person?”</p>
<p class="cnMzNzlhYjgwNWU3YzRhNTE4NjdlYTc0OWUwYzA3MjJh">“A Republican officer… ?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMmFhODBmMmJhNjQ0ZTZhYmQyYzA3ZTY0ZDQwOWJi">“I’ve never seen her before… ”</p>
<p class="cnMyNWQ5OTU0YTFkNjQ2NWFiNWU5ZDI2OWU4NmQ5Yjkw">“She wasn’t part of the garrison. A slave?”</p>
<p class="cnNhYWY4ZWUyZjQwODRmYmM5ZWYwMjNmMzI0ODNhOWQy">She bent down next to a man who seemed to have been caught in an explosion. His body was riddled with small cuts and wounds, and his eyes were covered in bandages. A nasty bump on his chest suggested one or more of his ribs had broken, threatening to pierce through the skin. A young girl, perhaps in her early teens, was holding the man’s hand, her face wet with tears.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjkxYWU1MDRiNzRlMDliNjJiMWY4NzYzY2ZmODg4">“Hello there,” she said, intentionally making her voice just loud enough to carry over the square, audible to all. “Is this man your father?” The girl’s eyes met her own, red and raw from crying. She looked Amelia over, before nodding slowly.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2VhZDc5ZDg2MDQwZjFiYmE1OWUwYzg0ZTgzZjA5">“Da’ worked in the warehouses… he… he got blown up-!” her voice broke at the end, unable to stop herself from sobbing.</p>
<p class="cnM4NmJkNWFlY2FmMzQzOWJiYzQxODFkZWQ3MDU1MTRk">“Would it be okay, if I healed him? Is that alright?” She let her voice take on the tone she had heard for so many years in the hospital. The tone she had grown to truly despise, the doctor’s bedside manner, but now… now she was the one rendering aid she began to understand its value.</p>
<p class="cnNmMmIxYWUxM2M2NzRhMDg5MDRmNTJhOGIzMzA5NjU5">“You… you can do that? Make Da’ better?” The girl stopped sobbing, her eyes growing wide like saucers.</p>
<p class="cnM4Njc3YzhiYzA2ZDQ4M2RhNjAwZGUwN2Q0NjVkM2Nk">“I can. I would need to touch him, is that okay?”</p>
<p class="cnM5Nzg0OGU3Mjc2MTQ4MzQ4YTQ4ZDY0Y2QxOGQ1ZmRk">“Y-yes! Please Miss…”</p>
<p class="cnNmZTI4MjMxMTI0YjQ0NjRiMDM5Yjg1MWNiYTVlMmU1">Amelia gently touched the man’s chest, and invoking one of the lesser healing spells, golden light, with flecks of blue, traveled from her own body into the injured man. Within seconds, he was breathing normally, the cuts and wounds had closed up and the broken ribs mended. The man reached up and removed the bandages around his eyes.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjkzZDM2YjhjZjQ3MGE4NzEzYTg0YWQyOWVmNDM0">“I can see… I can see! Oh, my daughter! My sweet, I can see your beautiful face again!”</p>
<p class="cnM5NWVlY2M4M2U1YzRhOGQ4MWQzZWMxOGY1ODY3YWRh">“Da!” The girl threw herself into her father’s arms, weeping loudly.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTcxZDNjMjYwMjQ1NjZhOWY0MTU3Njk1ODUyNWJh">“Thank you! Thank you, holy priestess! I’m not worthy… a thousand blessings upon you!” The man cried, grasping her hand with his own, his eyes brimming with gratitude.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDhjYmM1YTE1MTRiZjRhY2RiYmQzNTA0MTJhZTFk">“Thank you!” Amelia beamed, as the crowd now had its full attention upon her.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzI1NmZhZGFlOTRiMjE4NGMzN2ViNGE3MzViYzQz">“She healed him!”</p>
<p class="cnMwNzY0YTA0MmJiNDRhNGI4MWQ0NmI1YWFjMDY3NDU1">“Is she a captive?”</p>
<p class="cnNmM2NhNmMzM2U1ZTQ3ZDE5ZjEzYmFkNDJmYzY4YjRh">“A member of the church, here? Are we saved?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NThjYjliYWIxODQwMTc5MDVlNzg5YThmZTcyMzYw">“Why would they let her help us…”</p>
<p class="cnM2NmYzOWY5ZWZiYjQ3YmRiNThiMTAyOTliMzM0NDVh">“I…” Amelia said, standing up. The crowd grew silent as she spoke. “... am a traveling healer, not a member of the church, offering my services to those in need! I have obtained permission from the captain,” she gestured to Serena, “to render aid to all of you. I would very much like to heal those who need it, so please, allow me this kindness…” she punctuated her little speech with a polite bow. Hopefully bowing was seen as polite in this world’s human culture.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWI0ZjQ5NDkxMDQ1YTI4N2NiMzVkMWMxNWQxZTll">Unfortunately, the focus of the crowd now seemed to be on Serena herself, and the atmosphere that had started to be touched by optimism and hope was now laden with fear.</p><span class="cmQ5ZDkwOGQxZDQ0ZjQ2YWVhYmNjZTJkOTZmYjNlZTYy"><br/>This story is posted elsewhere by the author.

<p class="cnNhODgyYWI1NzAwNDQ0NGY4YmM3YTE5NTM0ZmJkYjlk">“The… sword demon!”</p>
<p class="cnNjODNmYzk4MTJiNjQ3MGZhZTNlM2E1Y2NiMzU1ZTAw">“The captain of the <em>black ship</em>!”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTU2MzRlZDYzMjRmM2I5NjgyNDY2M2U0YjcyZjEz">“We’re doomed!”</p>
<p class="cnM0MTBjYThhNGM3YjRhOGRhNWE1OWQ4MmI4N2RlN2Jk">“Lord, save us!”</p>
<p class="cnNhNWE2YTRmYjZmNzQ4NWM5YTdmNmVlNDBiNmQ1MTk4">“Tsk!” Serena spat, drawing her firearm and firing it into the air. The sound of the gunshot sent birds flying into the air across the port, and within the square, the humans cowered. “I don’t have time for this! Amelia!”</p>
<p class="cnMxNjIyY2NiMzA4ZDRkODdhMDAzYzhjMjBhYjY0ODVm">“Y-yes, Lady Halen!”</p>
<p class="cnMzNDE3NGFkOWUxNTQzMmY5OGYzZjg3MmY0MDZiYTEx">“You have one hour. Heal whomever you can. Guards!”</p>
<p class="cnNiZTFlMzdiZDgzYzQwZDM5YzY0YmM4Y2EzOTJhNTAw">“Yes, Captain!” came a chorus from the surrounding demons.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjEzOGU1MzMyYjQyNTZhMWM3ZjYyYmM4Y2EzYmUy">“If any of them start causing problems, shoot them! If they’re too cowardly to accept the aid of <em>my human</em> then they can meet their maker! Someone get me Dagon!”</p>
<p class="cnM4MmZiMDFiMjNjMDQwOWZhNzM4M2M3OGMyYzMyMDFj">“Aye, Captain!”</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2ZhNzA5ZGIyNzQwZjE4YzI3MWMyZGQ3ZWYwM2Fh">Well, that was a little bit aggressive, but it had kept things from escalating. Amelia put her hand up.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWFiNGIyMTBhYTQzM2Q5NDE2MGQ3MDc0NTEwMWU2">“Okay!” She said, trying to sound cheerful. “Who needs healing? Quickly now! I haven’t got long!” A long silence followed, then, a soft voice broke out.</p>
<p class="cnM0MGRkMzBiOWFkNjQ4NDZiZDQ5YmNjNmMxMzY2MWU3">“My arm… is broken. Please…”</p>
<p class="cnNiYmYxZGNjNDk1NjRiNmJiMzIzYzFlY2ZkMWNiMzk0">“No problem!” Amelia bounced to the next person, and then the next, and the next after that. Each flash of gold and blue was followed by a flurry of gratitude and as the gratitudes rang out, the touch of hope once again fell upon the captive humans.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjA0NjQwODkwYzQ3ZTY4NDA1NDgzYTg0NjU4NzRi">After a while, Dagon appeared and replaced Serena, who walked off towards the port’s citadel. She would wonder later what that was about. For now, she had more work to do, more happiness to spread.</p>
<p class="cnM5NGVhMDRiYWEzMzRmNmJiOWY2ODY3N2RlYjNjYTEz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNWFjMmU5ZmUwNjQxZmQ5MjY5MWFmODA3ZjljNWY2"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNjMmU4MmIwZjk5NzRiMjA5MDQ3MGM4YzJkZTM2N2Nl">Serena entered the citadel through the collapsed wall, the front entrance having been destroyed by the torpedo. She had to step over the dead, for the bodies of civilians and soldiers lay strewn about, half buried in the rubble. A demon guard led her through the stone corridors until they entered the office of whoever it was who commanded the port’s defender garrison.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTNlZTIyYjcyZTRmMzViYjdlNWViY2ExMjFmY2M4">She had to duck slightly, the human building not quite built to account for the extra height her horns gave her. Inside the office was a table with maps of the defenses they had overcome, and lying upon this table was the corpse of a Republican officer, a gunshot wound to his head. A familiar demon, with pale grey skin, was standing beside the body.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzZhODljNzU2YzQ0NjFiZDc0M2Q2ZDQ1NDZkMzcz">“He shot himself, the moment I entered,” said the demon, “but not before trying to burn these,” he passed a few sheets of paper, more than half of them burned, to her. “Blueprints. Some secret worth dying to protect.”</p>
<p class="cnNjN2E3MDhlYTU2MDQyYzBiZWY2MDRiYzRkZTE1ZDI1">“Korvus,” she acknowledged, and Korvus nodded in return.</p>
<p class="cnMwMmExMGU5ODFmMTQ3OWY4NzhhMTY2NmY0ZjJhNTU4">“Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNTU1YWFjZmE3YTRkNGY5ZDYzYzFhNGJjYTYyZDI1">Serena looked over the papers, she was no inventor, no genius of mathematics like her younger sister, but she knew enough to figure out what these papers described.</p>
<p class="cnNiZWUyMWZjNGUxNjRlNGU5YTkzOWM5ZWY3OTBiZTk2">“A new torpedo. A new weapon,” she said.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjkzYjZmNGRjMDQ5ZjFhMTY1N2NkYTExOTMwZTAy">“Aye. Think it’s what hit the ship?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OWQzOWM3N2M4MjQxNDE5N2MyZDI0OTMxMGRhNTQy">“Could be. It was launched from a light craft. The sizes match… but how? A new type of explosive?”</p>
<p class="cnNlOGMzOWFlYTFiYjRmMDdhOTM3YzRiNTg0MDg2OTUw">“No, even worse. Mages are saying there are signs of spellwork, where it hit the citadel. Lingering disruption in the aetherfield outside.” He spat on the body next to him. “Wiped out half a squad. Spellwork, in a <em>torpedo</em>. It must be runecraft, the old language.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOGMxYWFiY2RmYzQzN2M5NjJhOTNmYjc4YTQwNDkz">“Seven hells…” Serena muttered. The humans were always innovating, and the engineers of the other human kingdoms were almost certainly contributing to the Republican efforts. “With this… a frigate could take down a battleship!” She felt a headache coming.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWQ4ZDNiMGViNTQ1ZDZhN2M2NmY0YTIxNzM0MDY0">“They will never stop trying to kill us,” Korvus intoned. “Their false book… their lies. They will never accept that Christ was a demon. They cannot. It’s the source of all their evil cast upon us, their heresy.”</p>
<p class="cnNhOThkNDkzMDkwYzQ5ZTc5ZjljN2ZjOTIxMGVhNDZh">“Tsk!” She clicked her tongue. Reading over the documents, before folding them and putting them in her breast pocket.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjdlMDlmMTY2ODQ2NWFhYzNmZjNkM2EyMWQyNDlj">“There’s something else, Captain,” Korvus said, eying her. “Above.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YjMxZDNiNDFjYzRiMDY4NjY0YWVkY2E1YzliN2Q2">“Show me.”</p>
<p class="cnM1OTM1YjM0NzRjOTQ3Mjg5YzQyZjY0ZDhjMDE2NDQw">Korvus led her to the roof. Overlooking the town she could see all the fires had been put out, and in the distance, the <em>Vengeance</em> displayed a flurry of activity as firemages undertook emergency repairs, welding plates of metal over the hole in the hull. The fading scents of battle, of charcoal and crystal explosives, still lingered in the air.</p>
<p class="cnNkY2QzY2Q4YWQ4ZDQzMDM5YmE4MDM2YjgyMWViNzA4">It was almost midday, the sun beating down warmth that was quickly whisked away by the cool breeze.</p>
<p class="cnM5MmQ5Y2ZjMjgwYzRiMzliNGNhZjIyNjZhMDNmMDlk">“That’s the other problem we have,” Korvus said, pointing down below. Serena followed his finger and her eyes met a figure, small from here, that was hurrying from one person to the next, short bursts of gold and blue erupting here and there.</p>
<p class="cnM4NWZhYzE3NGM5NDRkNTY5OGIyNjU1ZmRiZGVlYzBj">She steeled herself. She had been waiting for this conversation. Of all the demons under her command, Korvus, the commander of the ground forces, hated humans the most. She would have to be tactful, as despite her being his commanding officer, he was, like her, a Speaker, and the chain of command between Speakers was enforced less by paper and military discipline, but by force and the threat of it.</p>
<p class="cnM1M2IyOGE0MThjMTRmMmI4NzE5NDUwYTY1YmI4ZjIw">“What madness has taken hold of you, Captain?” He said quietly, watching the square below. “What have you brought into our fold? You invite the very cause of our destruction.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDU2NTZlYWVkMjRhZTc4Nzk4ODFiMzBiNGVjYWFj">“She is vouched for, Korvus. By me, the first officer and quartermaster.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDAxNjAwODgyMDQ0Nzk5MzliZmRkZWVhNGJkYWU2">“Vouched for!?” He snapped, “How long have you known this… <em>human</em>? When did she board the ship?”</p>
<p class="cnNlOTBiMzVlM2Q2ZTRmMDk4Y2JiZDE0NzQ3ZjVmY2M3">“I explained this before.” Serena had lied through her teeth when she had pulled in all her officers to show off Amelia for the first time. She had told them Amelia had long been employed by her family, a promising talent they had been nurturing to aid them for the future. It was a lie that was going to have consequences for the family, a lie for which she was going to have to write a very difficult letter to the patriarch. Hopefully, he could be persuaded of the value Amelia could bring, despite any possible loss of reputation and influence.</p>
<p class="cnNjZWJiNGZmZjBjYzQ1Yjk5YjY0MGZjZDZhMWRmN2Nl">“You explained <em>nothing</em>! This has <em>never</em> happened before and for good reason! This was foolish!”</p>
<p class="cnMyZjA4YzM0NGE2MDRhNGE5YzliM2VlZDZiNzIzMGU2">Serena felt herself starting to get angry. It was always like this, with Korvus. Always a fight.</p>
<p class="cnNmMWI4MWEyZTBjMzRkOTFhZmM5YmJkZmUwOWQ1ZmQ4">“Anathor said the ship trusts-”</p>
<p class="cnNkY2NmNzYxYTgxNTQ1ZDBhZjBhNjQ5OWEyYTI0MWI2">“Anathor said!” Korvus interrupted, spittle flying from his mouth. “The ship!” He turned, glaring at her. “Not everyone is on board with putting faith in the <em>ship!</em> And Anathor! He’s not even in the chain of command! He has no allegiance to you! He says it himself, he is the guardian of the ship, not the guardian of <em>you!</em>”</p>
<p class="cnNjYTBhZDg3MWQwNjQxNzRiMWJiNjBiNTRmYzY3NmQy">“I trust Anathor, he-”</p>
<p class="cnMzNzM3NmI1NWRhOTQ5MDZhYzUwMTM3NGQ3YmIxYWRm">“We don’t even know <em>what</em> he is! Huh? And you trust him? Has he ever told you what’s on the fourth deck!? Ever shared that little bit of knowledge?”</p>
<p class="cnNiOWZjNzRlNDZiYTRkYmU4N2YwYTlhMDYyZWJlOTk4">Serena narrowed her eyes at him. “<em>Commander,</em> if you keep interrupting me, you’re going to have a problem with more than just the <em>human</em>.” Korvus’s expression fell, and he turned back to the square, sighing.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTFjMDM0M2ZlNzRkZDM5MzQxOWNjNDdlMDRjMTAz">“And now… you even defend her, over me.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMzQ1YmVkY2NmMTQ3OGY5OTk4MzQwNjgzYTA3MDJm">“Eighteen demons. Four sailors and fourteen shock troopers, <em>your shock troopers</em>. That’s how many she saved from certain death. Dozens of others were <em>healed</em>, Korvus. Dozens of your brothers, ready to keep fighting.” Just as she thought she would make some progress with him, Korvus shattered that, with another softly spoken question.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzljZmUwMDlhNTRmNGY5ZjE4NmI1MzEzYWQ0NDhm">“She’s a Speaker, isn’t she?” He asked.</p>
<p class="cnM1YjU4NDE4NDc1ZTQ1NzQ5YWJhMDhmZWIyYTUwNGYy">“... Yes.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNGY1NGIxZjVjMjRkZGFhMWQ5ZmIyMjI3ODY3YjYz">The wind picked up, caressing her hair as a painful silence took hold of them both. It was broken, eventually, by Korvus.</p>
<p class="cnM4OWExYTVmZGQ1OTRhYjc4Y2JhNmViNzFjMzBjMWNk">“A Speaker of <em>Aseco</em>?<em>” </em>He asked. “One of my soldiers told me she spoke one of his spells.”</p>
<p class="cnNmODI0OTdiZTQyNzQ2NWI5NTY4NGEzYTg3NWQ4Mzlk">“That’s right.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNjBhOGVkZjUyNjQxNTRiMTYwYjNkZWEwMTkwYjJm">“... that’s how I know you’re lying, captain.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MzYyMGQ2MDc3YjRkNzk4YzhhOTMyZmUwN2I4ZTZk">“<em>Excuse me?”</em></p>
<p class="cnM1YmI1ODBiNGMxNzQxZDc5NTRlZmU0NjVjNGY2NWY3">“Speakers of <em>Aseco</em> come from one place, and one place only; the Golden Cathedral. They are all, <em>all</em>, under the direct command of the human pope, for their branch is one of the most divine under the human gods. It is only within the human Vatican, the holiest of places, guided by their strongest priests, could a human ever hope to commune with <em>Aseco </em>and his family. There is no way she managed it, secreted away in demon territory under your family.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNDU5OGUwNDI2NDRlMGQ5NTVlNzUzNmNjZThiZWM5">Seven hells! How did Korvus know that? She had only known about the origin of Speakers of <em>Aseco</em> when Tomes had told her earlier, and all her quartermaster did was read books!</p>
<p class="cnNhZWJmNTAyZjU4NDRmZTFiOTdhOTcyOTAzYjdjNzk1">“Ah…” she muttered, resisting the urge to grab her horns, “I’m getting pissed off, why do you have to make my job so hard, Korvus?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNTQ5NmU5ZDAzYjQ0NmJhYTM3Mzg2YmU5NjBhMDM2">“Likewise, Captain, likewise.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MTg1YzNiYjYwODRkMWViNjNhYmQ4NWExYjk5Yzgw">“When did you get so smart? Never seen you read anything other than a battle plan.”</p>
<p class="cnM0YTc2ZTE3ZjhjNTRhNTM5ZGI4YTY0N2IzODI0YzA4">“... I had the motivation,” he said, a solemn expression on his face.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWMwOTcxN2EzZDQyYzBhMjk3YzNhMmU5ZDc4ZmEw">Amelia was working on the soldiers now, having healed all the civilians that needed healing. Dagon was staying near her, his presence, along with the surrounding guards, was keeping things under control.</p>
<p class="cnM5OWE4NjgzZDAwNTQwYWY5ODU5MGM5NWY5NDk0MWQz">How many people had she expended aether on? A hundred? Two hundred? Her reserves seemed <em>endless</em> and the human wasn’t slowing down. Amelia was invaluable, and Serena suspected whatever other secrets she had, would only make her even more so. The issue was, how could she salvage this situation, how could she convince Korvus?</p>
<p class="cnNjMmNjZjljZjAxOTQwYmQ4ODU1NTExMjA2NjcwNTg2">Her mind raced, thinking of another lie she could tell before giving up. She didn’t know what Korvus knew about the situation. She was backed into the corner, with one last card to play, before things became very risky.</p>
<p class="cnNlNWIyOTY0MDdlMDQ2NDdiMTE2NzFjOTU1YjA5NzI3">The truth.</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2Y0MWYwM2M2ZDQ1YTNhMTExNzZmZWNjYjIzZGFj">“We… don’t know how she boarded the ship. It was early this morning. I was going to hang her, but then we figured out she was a Speaker, and then we talked, and then we made a deal…” Korvus was silent, not reacting to what she said. Perhaps, that was a good sign. “She’s not from this place, not from Cascadia, Korvus. She might have come from a different realm altogether. She has no dislike of demons, she even likes us. This was all verified with a truth-teller. Trust me on this, Korvus.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNDIzZWFlMTQxNjRiZDFiZmI5NTFjOTE0MzE5ZTJm">“Hmm… trust,” he intoned. He clasped his left hand with his right, cracking the knuckles one by one. After he was done, he began working on the other hand. “My father…” he said, almost whispering, “... was a ship-builder. Not the metal kind, but the old one. Wooden. He would buy hardwood from the humans, Republican traders, and have lift engines brought up from Centralis. He would build small hulls, transport ships, and the like. He and his workers were hard, honest men, and got on well with the humans, even if they always tried to cheat him a little on prices. We lived in a small village, under the domain of Greatlord Orlan, by the mountains.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MjcyNGI1Y2NjMjRkMDBiMmMxM2Q5MWE2OWI5MDVm">“... oh.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YTUxYjlhYTk4MjRkOWRiNTY5MThmYzBmZjFlYzJi">Korvus looked at the sky, he wasn’t crying, but sadness bled from him nevertheless.</p>
<p class="cnMzNWUwZmNlMzAyODQ2NjhiN2Y0OTUyZjE5N2Q3ZTJk">“They attacked us with the same ships we built for them. It wasn’t even the Republican army at first, they came later. The initial assault was led by the fanatics, too unstable to serve in the Inquisitor Navy. Village after village. In the fighting, I came across the son of one of the traders I had broken bread with. He was cutting down a child. I killed him.</p>
<p class="cnMwM2JiNjAwZTM0NDQxZjM4NjE4N2I0YzkxOWNhYzgw">"When I finally returned to my village, I had hoped that my family had escaped, but instead… instead I met them again… <em>impaled on pikes</em>. It was then, that I Spoke the First Word, for the first time.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNGRhMDA1MDI2ODQ0YTA5MTFjYjMzNmFlNWI4ZTc5">Serena gulped. “I didn’t know… you never said.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NjdjZjZiODAwMzQ2MWFiN2E3MTZlMjdhNWM0MWVm">“Humans… and demons too, call me a mad dog. Battle-crazed. Thirsty for blood. They use all these words, all these names, that suggest I’m somehow crazy, but the opposite is the truth. I had my mind set clear that day, and every day since.”</p>
<p class="cnNmOTExMGZlNjY4YTQ2YmM5OGEzNzZmYTFkNTIzNjgy">He turned to her, his eyes clear and cold.</p>
<p class="cnM1Yjk0ZWFhYjc0YjQwYzlhNDBlMDUyNzU2NmIzYTc1">“But <em>you</em>, Captain. You are afflicted with the same disease that killed my father, my family, and my friends. For the sake of everything, the crew, my men, I cannot let this go on any longer.” Korvus raised an arm high, fist clenched. Serena was confused for a moment, before recognizing the hand signal that the combat troops used. Her eyes darted to the square, where she saw Amelia, bending over as she treated a wounded soldier.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTgxMzg2YWYzNTQ1ZTU5MThjZGJjMGQzMjdiMzA4">Her eyes went wide. The square’s guards, some two dozen demons, were pointing their rifles straight at the human healer, who hadn’t yet noticed.</p>
<p class="cnM0YmU2ZmY3MWU5ODQ4YTc4ZGZiMDhhYmQ1NzM5NmEw">“I will cure you of your insanity,” the demon next to her said, dropping his arm in one swift motion.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDQ1Nzk0YjUyNzQzNjRiNzc1NTUyMWE0MGM1YjAz">“Korvus!” she spat out, but it was too late. A cascade of gunfire rang out on the square, and Amelia fell into a crumpled heap, her golden hair glimmering in the sunlight.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTg0YmZkMTA4ZTRjZjE4YzA5MWYyNGZlMDNkOGQ4">The world suddenly became very dark. She could see nothing but Amelia, unmoving. Her vision was surrounded by black and she could feel her heart, pounding like a drum in her ears. She was freezing cold and boiling hot, and the feeling of wetness was on her face. There was only one thing she could do, one action.</p>
<p class="cnM0N2RlNjgyZjhmYjQzZGJiZDJkZGNhNzZiYTdjZGM5">There was no controlling this.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDljMWE4YzQ5NTQxZTc5MjFkMDQ2Y2E1NTE2NjVi">Her aether frothed in delight.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM2OGQzYmEwZDcxMTRiYTU4YzdjOWMzZWQyMjlkN2Vh"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMwMjYxMjBhYjg0MzQ1NDZhZmU3NTRjOTYyOWMwNWE5">The Word was Spoken and power, chaos, and violence <em>erupted </em>from Serena. Korvus was blown back, slamming through the wall of a building, collapsing it upon himself. The citadel was destroyed, unable to withstand the force of the Spoken Word. The stone walls crumbled, dooming any demons inside to a horrific death. Those below, humans and demons alike, were thrown back, piling up against the sides of the buildings ringing the far side of the square in a mass of bodies and broken limbs. Their lives were saved only by the distance from the Spoken Word.</p>
<p class="cnNlNThiMDNiODNkNjRjOTBiNzc0YjJjYWVjZDM4NmZl">She hovered there, in the air, her connection with the aetherfield so strong that she could mimic the levitation effect of the lifting engine of the <em>Vengeance</em>, of which she could sense in the distance, the pulses from it beating through the aetherfield like a heart.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2I0NWY4NzczMDRmNjg5M2ZjM2ZiOTIxNmRlNGY1"><em>Something else is there</em>. A thought arrived in her head, formed from curiosity that was not her own. Her attention was pulled to the black ship in the distance. Something <em>strange</em> called to her. There was a song, its melody caressing the aetherfield, a song just for her. Beckoning her.</p>
<p class="cnNjZTM4ZDE0ODdhZTQzMjc4OTAxZDljODZkN2Y5MGQ2">It came from the fourth deck.</p>
<p class="cnNiYmZmNWVkNzU3ZTQwNmQ5MGZkNTY3MzhhZGQwYTM4">No! This was not her mind! Serena bit her tongue, using the pain to align her thoughts once again. She fought to keep the Word in control, to maintain her mind! She wrapped her body in layers of green hues. The normal auras of a warrior - red, orange, and yellow - first, second, and third-level respectively were now beneath her. The fourth-level, accessible only to those who can Speak the First Word, layered upon her skin as a subtle green aura, providing her a defense no shellfire could hope to penetrate.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjkyZWMxNWJlMzRjNDA5NzM0YTkzOGM5MzNmMThk">The same aura spread into her sword, strengthening and sharpening beyond anything a blacksmith could manage.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzZlMWU2MmNkOTRhZDdiODNjMTY0YjM1ZGIxYzQ2"><em>Narean,</em> the Word itself, a manifestation of the will and power of the demon god of the same name, clung to her mind, eating away at her sense of self and demanding control, demanding violence and that blood be spilled in its name.</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2M1MzgwMDI0MDQ2MjhiNzQwZDU4MmI1MTgxY2Nj">“<em>I am in control,</em>” she spat, gritting her teeth and steeling her willpower.</p>
<p class="cnNlYzE1YTNhYWU5NzRhODQ5YTUxZTBhMmY4ZDg2ZWVm"><em>A traitor. Kill the mutineer</em>. The Word whispered to her. <em>Rip him to pieces</em>. A warning flashed through her mind. She had Spoken badly, in haste, and was already seeing the first signs of losing control: Aether-Cognitive Resonance.</p>
<p class="cnM2NzE3ZTViZmFkMTQzM2FiYWYxNDc2NzhhN2Y2M2Fj">“Argh!” Serena roared, her voice sounding like that of a beast. Another pulse of power emitted from her, and she felt her horns ignite with hellfire, a tail of flame formed from the base of her spine, and the faintest shadow of wings of black mist, not able to fully form in this realm, took vague shape upon her back.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzI0YmY2NjIyMDRiOTc4ZDRlNjNmMGI0NjEyNWQ0">“<strong>Bayle.</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTBkMjdlMTQwMDRjZjM5ZjJiOTgwNDNkNDQyMzAw">The Spoken Word rippled through the aetherfield, triggering the attention of any Speaker or aetherscope within twenty klicks. The building her enemy had been blasted into <em>exploded</em> in black and grey flame and within it stood the towering figure of her opponent, glaring at her.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjE3MmIxYmMyZjRiZDU5ZDhjYmI4Zjk0MjhhN2E1">Dark mist danced along his horns, and his grey body was now, like hers, hued in green. His hands had become scaled and his fingers changed into razor-sharp talons.</p>
<p class="cnNlMzFkNDllOWM1MTRlNTY5M2M3OGU4Y2Q0NmU2NTRk">The force of his Word had excited Serena, and she gripped her cutlass tighter. To finally come head to head against <em>Bayle</em>! A chance then, to finally teach that demon god its uncouth and barbaric way of fighting fell short against her honorable blade!</p>
<p class="cnNiOThmZDNmMWNiOTQ3MThhMWJmNmVjZDBjYWFlMjc3">No! These were not her thoughts! They were the desires of <em>Narean</em> manifesting within her. Her control was slipping.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzE0NWQ4MGVmNjQ2OTY5ZmNmYzE5ZGQwZTg1NjBk"><em>Defeat Korvus. Save the human,</em> she thought.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzE2MDM4NDdjMjRmMWI5YzU0YjMxNWNlNzRhODRk"><em>Kill Korvus. Kill the human,</em> the Word inside her demanded.</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2I0ZjhiN2VmYTQxNjFiMTcwODgzYWNlMTEwNmJi">“A captain… does what’s best for her crew,” said Korvus. “Stand down, Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnNkODRmNDVhZTZmMjQyMWNhY2FhMGJiMGMwOTFkY2Uz">Unable to stop herself, she launched herself at the mutineer, bringing down her sword upon him. The blade was stopped by the back of Korvus’s arm, but it still cut him, just barely. She struck him again and again, as he parried and defended her assault.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzU5Yzc3YTgzOTQ4MzQ4MzAyYTI1ZTAyZDhjYzk5">“Hmm…” Korvus said, before punching her in the gut, having found an opening in her attacks. “You’re not fully in control of your Word, are you?” He asked as Serena flew back, through a ruined wall. She rolled on the ground, before finding her feet and stance, the taste of iron appearing in her mouth.</p>
<p class="cnM4MzczOTllNmUzMTRjMjFhM2EzZTIyNjFiN2JiMjY3">“Bayle!” she roared, “You traitor!” the flames on her horns took on a new intensity and she flung herself back into the fight. Her sword slashed again and again, her tail of flame whipping and striking her enemy. As the rage increased, she felt herself become faster and as she became faster she felt her mind relinquish more and more control, and as the control slipped, the more powerful she became. Her green aura began to take on flecks of blue.</p>
<p class="cnNmOWMyNWYyMTQxZjQyMzA4ZDEyNDFjODBjNzMxNDNm">“Bayle!?” exclaimed Korvus, now needing to duck and dodge her attacks. “Narean is taking control! Captain! You must not become a vessel! You-” he leapt to the side, avoiding a slash that destroyed the wall behind him and gorging a chunk out of the building behind it.</p>
<p class="cnM2N2VjMzFiOWNjODQ0NmVhODZlODlmYjA3NTczYjdl">She chased him, chased Bayle. With every swing of her sword, she felt she was coming closer and closer to victory! How dare this demon mutiny against <em>her</em>, against the mighty <em>Narean!</em></p>
<p class="cnM0MzJhNjg4MjMzNjRlYjM4NzlmYjcyM2FjZjU2MGY2">“I’m sorry, Captain,” Bayle muttered as he avoided another attempt at his life. “That it has come to this...” The demon lept backward, putting distance between them. A warning flashed in what little of Serena’s mind was still in control.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDk0YzVkMDQ2ZDRlM2ZhNWZiNmVmYjcwMjU2OWM2">Danger.</p>
<p class="cnM1YmE2NGFiMWFlZjQ4ZTM5OWZlNGJkYzJmNjYzMTM2">Bayle clasped his hands together, and his aura exploded, the green aura replaced with a deep blue, with flecks of indigo. The fifth-level, with a hint towards the sixth! When had this traitor exceeded her abilities? How dare he!</p>
<p class="cnNjYjFhZWU4NDZjMTRlMTU5MTIxMGE5ZmU4YWQxMTk4">Serena, or rather, Narean, gritted her teeth. She squeezed the power of the Word inside her further, fueling the process with her rage and determination. Her skin cracked and bled, hellfire spewing uncontrollably from her, and then it settled, as for the first time she crossed the barrier, just barely, into the fifth-level. She struggled to catch her breath, her body and brain burning from the exertion.</p>
<p class="cnNiMWI1ZTgwMzdlMTQxMjc4MjIxMTcxNTA5MjVjNzVk">Bayle did not give her time to recover and attacked her immediately. A series of punches and claws assaulted her being, at a speed this vessel had never defended against before! Blue aura or not, she had to put everything into the defense, frantically parrying and dodging as the borderline sixth-level attacks threatened to end her, only the natural talent of this vessel kept it alive!</p>
<p class="cnNlYWJjNDJmNTdiZjQ5MDg5ODA0MmQ1NjQyODBkMWM5">It was a losing struggle, and after only a few moments her left arm was sheered through at the elbow, and a follow-up punch broke her ribs, sending her flying through the walls of multiple buildings. She spewed blood, coughing and spluttering. She tried to stand but her body was reaching its limits and refused to obey her.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDczMWE4OWYwZDQ2ODJiMzgxMWJmOTRlNTI1MzE0">“Narean. Your conflict with my god, and your arrogance, has doomed your vessel,” Bayle said, approaching where she lay sprawled. The demon raised his fist, talons shining in the sunlight, before bringing them down on her throat in a killing blow.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjJiZDJkZDIzODRiYThiZDEyODllNGZlMDVkYWI3">Those sharp talons met her skin and- what was this! They didn’t cut her! Her vision, which was fading to black, suddenly became clear, as warmth spread through her! Her ribs mended, and her left arm <em>grew back</em>. Her body radiated golden light, as spell-wards wrapped around her, supplementing her blue aura.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTlmYmNhMWQ5ZDQzNzJiZjA0ZTAzNTI3MTVmNzFm"><em>Amelia..</em>. A tiny part of Serena’s mind called out, but it was not enough. She could not wrestle back control from the Word she had Spoken.</p>
<p class="cnNiMmI2MmI3NzZhMzQ3Zjg4YjNiYmUwM2FiMDIzY2Zl">She was back up! She could continue fighting! She lept at Bayle, slashing away, who returned in kind, however his strikes now struggled to damage her! As she frantically attacked, she felt faster and stronger than ever before, her body enhanced by more than just defensive spells!</p>
<p class="cnNjNWFhOWQ1YzhlODQ5YTRiNmU2MWQxOWRjMDI0NGMw">“Grr!” Bayle mumbled, as the initiative was slowly lost. “It seems… the human survived. She must die first.” He threw a wild swing at her, destroying the buildings behind her, and forcing her to throw herself to the ground to dodge. The traitor took the opportunity, and lept away, his powerful legs taking him in a great arc in the sky.</p>
<p class="cnNhNGE4ODdmNDNiZjQwOWNiYzI1ZGNmNDdmMmY1MWIz">Then, a tremendous boom sounded out, and a flash of golden light blinded her momentarily, as a great lightning bolt struck out from the sky, blasting Bayle over the port walls and into the farmland and forest beyond.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWVkOTliODVkNTRiMzZhZTBlZTViNjZlN2QzZDU5">She raced after him, consumed with rage, leaping onto a building and then over the wall. She found him in battle against… something. A golden light darted around the forest, almost too fast for her to track! Bayle was launching attacks in every direction, trees exploding with every strike, and chunks of earth were ripped up and thrown about the battlefield, each one enough to kill a dozen soldiers.</p><span class="cmZkZTE3MTZlMTM3ZjRkMjNiNDkwYWI5Y2M4OWU2NTkw"><br/>Love what you're reading? Discover and support the author on the platform they originally published on.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4ZDI2ZDBkYWQ2YjQ4NTZhMTlkMTliNDRlMWY5MzNi">The golden light stopped for a moment, and she saw it was a person. Inside that blinding light, a pair of blue eyes found her own and as it did, she felt her very core tremble for reasons unknown.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTIxYTZmMjVhYjRmMThiYWNiNDAxNDkyYTJlOTM2">“Hi,” the light said, “You in there, Lady Halen?” It vanished, avoiding another attack from Bayle, before casting another bolt of lightning that brought Bayle to his knees. It didn’t end there, and spell after spell was cast down upon the demon until the almost sixth-level aura faded, the grey skin cracked, and a glassy expression took hold. The light murmured a spell, and chains of lightning reached from the heavens, holding down the mutineer.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWFiYjI0OGEyNjQ0ZmE5OGI0MTc5N2ViZWFhMjYw">A human saint! A human saint was here! What interference was this, to take her kill from her! To deny her battle against her nemesis!</p>
<p class="cnMxODFmNTk2YTA4ZTRiNzY4OGMxNjQyMmYxNjUxOGFl">The saint must die.</p>
<p class="cnNhYjBjNjA4OTAyNDQ5NGU4MjNjMGEzZWI4MWM5MDNj">She leaped at the light, swinging her sword with everything she had. The vile creature dodged, darting a hundred meters away in a split second. Tsk! She gave chase, swinging her weapon again, but the human would once again dodge, again and again.</p>
<p class="cnMzZTIxNzM5ZTM0MzQ5ZWM5MTA0Mzk3ZGY5MzE3N2Fi">“Oh…” the saint said, tilting her head, “Narean, are you there?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNGRlMTY2MGQ5NzQyODA4Zjg1N2EyYThiOWI1ZTFj">“Don’t you <em>dare</em> speak my name, <em>human</em>!” She roared, slashing again but finding her sword couldn’t reach the fast-moving saint. “Coward! I will destroy you! What god presumes to interfere!”</p>
<p class="cnNmN2U0M2U3OWYyZTQ5NmU4NmJmZjI1MzY1OGUzODhj">“I suppose Serena is no longer there, so... I can speak openly... we… haven’t known each other long,” said the human, “but… there must be a reason I met you. I’ve thought about this a lot…” No matter what she did, the human effortlessly avoided her attacks, it was enraging. “I had my suspicions, and the more we talked, the more I was convinced. Then, I saw you smile and laugh at something I said and it confirmed it, in the deepest parts of my heart!” The human shook its head, smiling, its eyes looked at her with an expression… an expression of…</p>
<p class="cnNmZDUxMTM3ODZkYTQ1Yzk5NzJjMjVlMjkxNWZkMmI3">“Love! At first sight!”</p>
<p class="cnMyYTU3MTU2OGQyYjQzYzg5ZmZlOTMzNGQ0MzAxMDlm">The human dodged another attack, bringing its hands to its cheeks as it <em>blushed</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMzMzk0MGU1MGY1MjQyNTg4YmY4ZjhiZjEyZDExNWQw">“I said it! Oh my! I’m shaking! I’m sorry, I’m sorry! It’s all so sudden, but it feels so real! Do you feel the connection? I feel it! Ah, it’s embarrassing!”</p>
<p class="cnM1NTEzMGVlZGFlYzQ0YzZhYjQ3Y2RlOGM2N2Q0NTk2">“Die!” she roared, but no matter how much she tried, her desire could not be made a reality.</p>
<p class="cnM5Nzc2ZDU5ODk0ZjRhZjY5M2U1NWUxZTg5YTg4NzAw">“Well…” said the human, “I suppose it’s time to bring you back. You’ve destroyed so much of the port! Hrmph! <em>Sixth Circle, Aseco’s Restraint!”</em></p>
<p class="cnMxOGU5NmMwYjJhMDQ0OTM4N2JhMjliZDI3YTc3ZjY4">Suddenly, she was unable to move. No matter how much she strained and fought, the chains of lightning that held her were unmoved. “Human!” she hissed, “You vile creature! Release me!”</p>
<p class="cnMwZWNmM2NhOThiNjRjMTQ5YzZlODAwYzBhZjAyMjlj">“Oh dear,” came the response. “What was it you said, Narean? What god presumes to interfere? Well, now it’s my turn to ask <em>you.</em>” The human leaned towards her, and Narean felt something she never thought she would feel in the presence of a human.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDczM2E5ZjdhODRmZTNhMmQxNzJlMDIzMGUxNjlk">Fear. Raw, primal, fear.</p>
<p class="cnM3M2FmMzljYjg5OTRhNmI5OTI2M2NiOGQ0OGJhMTZm">“What <em>pathetic, childish, lesser</em> demon god presumes to interfere with <em>me and mine!?”</em></p>
<p class="cnM5MDFkNDhlYTBhNDRjNGNiMThmNTExNTY4ZTQ0MTMx">She felt herself gulp. What mad human had her vessel involved herself with!?</p>
<p class="cnNkYzdhZjNiZjljMjQzNmRiZGE1NGFmZmM3N2JmOTEz">“I had hoped that healing the body would heal the mind. Seems not. Appears I need to push a <em>little more</em>,” the human said, sounding thoughtful. “I'd forgotten the secret arts, that allow you to Speak without blowing everything up. Never had the use for it you see, me and my guildmates always took advantage of the initial power release in our raid tactics… Well then, brace yourself. This is going to hurt. A lot.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNGIzZmY1MmIyMzQxYjU4Yzk2MmY4ZmIwYWMzNzJi">The human, with a sickeningly smug expression on its face, took a breath.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTY1YjMyNWVhOTQ2ODk5NDZjMTUzNTdjNmZhOTRh">A moment of silence.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2IzNjM0NDgyNDRjZmNiNTk4NjQ2ZDBlMGZmOGIy">And then it <em>Spoke</em>, and the Words it <em>Spoke</em> rippled not through the aetherfield, but <em>through </em>the realm boundary, across the mists, and into the very halls of the demon gods themselves, where every lesser deity dropped what they were doing as an overwhelming, choking pressure dominated their spirits and threatened their very existence as the Words, carrying a deadly warning, forced them to <em>listen</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTY4YzQwZjdmMjQ5M2E4YTljOGY3YjU3YTk5Zjhm"><em>A monster</em>, Narean thought as control of her vessel was ripped from her.</p>
<p class="cnM5N2VmYzUyMWY0MjQ3MWU5ODA4M2ZjY2QxMWNiYzhi">The creature had not lied.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjk5YmI5OGQxZjQwNWI4OGQ3YzUyMDI5YTRjNjc5">It was very painful.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDg4ZjQ0Y2U1MTQzMDA4NGU4ZDI0YjI4OTA0MGJi"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MWE5ODYzMTljZjQ0ZWVhMGQ2NjBjMDEwOTBlOTM3"><img alt="New Scene - Dagon POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/dagon.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMzOWZlMDc2MjQzZTRlOWI5YjM4MjdkYjc3MThhN2E1">Dagon leaned back, hoping he did not appear as nervous as he felt. The demon in front of him, across the desk, had enough power to destroy him and everything he knew. A single word could have him begging for his life, which he would do if needed, even if it would be in front of every officer on the <em>Vengeance</em> who had been pulled into the captain’s quarters.</p>
<p class="cnM0MGMyOGI5OTYwYjQ4MmZhMmRiMDUxNDczMGEwNzE2">Not because the man was a Speaker, no. This demon had a far more powerful tool at his disposal.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGIzNDhlNTA3NjQ3YzI4ZTUzOThkZjRiMzIxZDc0">Political power.</p>
<p class="cnMzODRiNTJmYjBkNTRmYjU4YmMwZDFkM2UxMzcxZDI3">“The admiral…” the demon said, placing a cigar in his mouth, sparking a match with a flourish and lighting it. He took a drag, blowing smoke out of his nose, making him look like a dragon. Well, he <em>did</em> look like a dragon, due to the sharp, antler-like horns that crowned his head.</p>
<p class="cnM4Yjc1NGMwNDNkZDQyMGI5YTA2MWNhZDRmYWEwMWQ4">Also, the man’s nickname was quite literally the <em>Dragon.</em></p>
<p class="cnMyY2U4OTZiNWZmMzQyYjBiYTIwNjg1OTRhNmYxYWVk">“The admiral would like to know when the captain will wake up.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNmQwMTQxMDFkMDRkOWY5OGUxYTY0ZDcyMmRlMzFi">Seven hells! He was going to crumble under this pressure! The weight of the man bore down upon him, and he wasn't even a Speaker! If this was the power of a Highlord, then what was it like to speak to a Greatlord? Or even the positions above them!? It took Dagon everything he had not to swallow, or fumble his words. Damn politicians.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzg4MWNkNDc4MzQ3YjQ5ZDdiZGRkMjE5ZGU0OGVi">“Captain Halen is still recovering, Highlord. Her body is healed but her mind still rests. We do not know… how long it will be.” The last words were a struggle.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzk0N2E4OGE1MDRkOWViYTIxYzQ1NmI2ODYzNGM3">“It is so <em>extraordinary</em>,” intoned the demon, casting his eyes to the ceiling. “The aetherscopes on the fleet's intelligence ships detected two words being Spoken. One, <em>Narean</em>, then another, <em>Bayle</em>. One from your captain and the other from the commander of your ground forces. They fought. Why?” As he asked the question his eyes narrowed and met Dagon’s. The man probably already knew the answer, Dagon was not the first to be interrogated.</p>
<p class="cnM5MWM1MTAxYzFlNTQ5YTg4NWQ4NTI1ZjkyNWUwMTZi">So, he answered the question knowing whatever he said would not satisfy the Highlord. If he had to be dressed down by the <em>Dragon</em> for his military career to survive, then so be it.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjY2MmM0ZDZmMTQxMmZhOGZlZWI1NTZlMTcyNWUz">“Ah… That’s because Kor- the commander led a mutiny against the captain, Highlord. Two squads attacked us and-”</p>
<p class="cnMxZjllMzM2NTRmZjRjNGY5N2ZlYzY1NTYyNGE5NDZh">“That’s not quite right, is it?” The Highlord took another drag of his cigar, rolling it in his fingers. “They attacked the human? Did they not?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMmM1MGExYWFiYzQwNDY5NDY5OTNmNTk2MDUwN2U2">“Yes, Highlord. But… the human was part of the captain’s retinue, and so… an attack on the human was an attack… on her position…” Dagon trailed off, unable to continue under the glare he was receiving. The room's atmosphere was icy cold and the rest of the officers were dead silent, not moving a millimeter. Maybe if they didn’t move the <em>Dragon</em> wouldn’t see them.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzg2NzFhYTA0YzQ1YzJiM2M3N2ZmMTY4N2NiYWU2">“How puzzling,” said the Highlord, “because I just spoke to <em>her father</em>, and he has not heard of this development, nor given it his blessing. Her father has become <em>very interested</em> in this development, and if <em>he</em> is interested then <em>I</em> am interested.”</p>
<p class="cnNhOWJmODAwYTA5OTQxNzU5ZjExNjcxYjdiZWI2MTg5">Another drag of the cigar. The room was starting to smell. The captain hated smoking.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzUzMzUzMzdmNTQ0MzE5NzcwNmVjMTExMzhmMThi">“Furthermore… Korvus was a talented Speaker, close to the sixth-level. Some might say he was ahead of your captain in ability… so then, the question to be asked, is how was he subjugated? Do you know?”</p>
<p class="cnMxN2Y3MDg1NjdkOTQ0N2RiMWQ4YjY0NjI2YWJjY2Zk">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="cnM5YmM2MWNiODQ2ZTRkNGRiMDYzNDNmNDEzODNjNGE1">“Because, our aetherscopes detected holy attacks of a <em>very</em> powerful Speaker and yet, no Word was spoken that could bring them about. Which means, that human is capable of far more than she’s letting on…” Another drag of the cigar, another intimidation of a dragon from the demon’s nostrils.</p>
<p class="cnM2YmQ0Nzc4NDA0YTQzYmRhMmM3MjJhZjJmY2RmYTc4">"She must know a word from a combat branch. The lightning attacks were too powerful. Your captain has brought an unknown <em>dual-speaker</em>, at least, into the center of one of the most important military operations of this war.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OTA5NzhiNjZkMjRmOTRiMjdmMGM0NmYyYTEwMDU5">“I’m sure she-”</p>
<p class="cnMxYTU4YzJiMWM2ZDRlNTg4M2Q2NzIyOWQyMGM5NDE4">“Damn it, Officer! She might be hanged for this! Both of them!”</p>
<p class="cnM2OTMzM2UyZGYxYTQ2OGZhMmMzN2I1NzBiZjFjOGU1">Dagon gulped. Everything was so far out of his depth. Surely things would not escalate <em>that</em> far? “Highlord…” he said, voice straining, “But her father would not… permit that? His own daughter?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YzQzOTJhM2FiZTRkNTY5ZjAwZTcxMjQyNTljZDY0">“Could do. Would do. We’re trying to <em>win a war</em>, not frolicking around with <em>human</em> Speakers!” The demon stubbed his cigar out on the desk, crushing it angrily. “Not that I can hang them if I wanted to. I can’t even get to them! I can’t even talk to the damn <em>human! </em>Anathor!<em>”</em></p>
<p class="cnMxMDgwYTc2ZWNjOTQzNWE4ZWEzNjEyMzk5YzMwZjFh">“Hmm…” came the gruff voice from the moose head. “The medical wing is off-limits to you, Highlord. It is... beyond your authority.”</p>
<p class="cnNmOTdkMTAzMmEyMzQyNWY5YTMzMTFlNzhjZDc3MTBk">“You’re lucky you don’t have a material form, you bastard! What about the agreement?”</p>
<p class="cnNiZTFmZDgxNjFhZTQ4ZmM4OWI3NGUyZTRmN2Y3NjM1">“You <em>know</em> with <em>whom</em> the agreement was made, do you not? The ship has claimed both of them as under its protection. You may not touch them. Not without <em>her</em> permission.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMjU5ODhlOWQzMDRlMjc5MTE2OWExYWVhNTUzN2Q0">“I have three battleships sitting outside and a dozen heavy cruisers. What do you think would happen if I turned their guns on this ship, Anathor!?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMWViZmFjMDY3NDRjODI5Zjc2ODEzZDU1Zjg4NGU0">“...” the moose was silent for a moment. “Then… Highlord. I’m afraid you would be down a fleet…”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzEwMmU0MTNmYzRjMzFhM2FhYjVkYzQ1ODdiMTU1">Dagon didn’t know that the atmosphere could get any worse, but it somehow managed to. Thankfully his other officers had joined him in forming a nervous sweat. What comradeship! He would buy them all drinks in the afterlife!</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDY4MTM0OTRmMzQ3ZWViNzUwYWYzN2YwZDY1NTA1">The Highlord did not respond, instead taking out another cigar, which was probably worth more than his month's salary, and lighting it. A painful minute of silence filled the quarters.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDA1MGNjYmVmYTQyYTJhOTIwZTUyODVkOTk0NGE5">“Korvus will remain with us. When the captain wakes, inform her of such. I am disbanding your ground forces, we will take them and integrate them into our own. Where are the ones you captured?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNGUxZTI2ZGJjNzQ3YzA5YjI5YTFlYTZmMTBhZjk1">“Uh, in the cells, Highlord. Twenty-one, the others died during the… fighting.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODAzOGYwYjVhMzQ1NjQ5YzE4OTgzNzUwN2U3YWQx">“Good. Hang them all. Sail to Kenhoro, find some new sailors mad enough to work on this ship. Fix the ship at the Imperial shipyards and then sail for Shimashina.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NGU3Yzk0ZDNiNDQ5Y2JhYzA4OWUzMTk4MjQ2MGIz">“Y-yes, Highlord! That’s… far, why not at a closer dock?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MzhmMDU0ZTNjZDQ3NDJhNzc0MGMxNzhmZmJhOTIy">“One, I don’t care how great a healer that human is, nor her claimed <em>opinion </em>of demonkind. I want her as far away from the front line as possible.” The demon jabbed a finger at Dagon. “And two, that’s where your captain’s father is currently residing for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNGY4NTUwNGFkYTQzMDFiMmM5OWRiMzdhYmM3MzY5">“... ah.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NjFmZDQ3NjY5OTQxN2Y5M2RhNGY4MzlmZDI1OTEy">“He wants to spend time with his daughter.”</p>
<p class="cnM2YzhiNGQ0OTkzOTQ3M2ZiYjk1Yzc1NDlmMDhlNTQz">The Highlord took a slow drag, and then once again crushed the expensive cigar into the desk.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzMxYWRlZjQzZjRmYWQ5MGRmMGEzN2RmZWQwYmI4">“And the human.”</p>
<p class="cnM4N2Y0ZDMwOGE0ZjQxNTQ4NGUyNGQ5ZjMxNjY0N2Vj"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYTJlOTU3ZTM2YTQyODhhZTZlOWZmZmVlM2E5ZmEw"><img alt="New Scene - Elana POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/elana.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM4MzEzZWUxMzdiNzQ5OTdiOTU0ZGUzZjY5Nzc2YjVi">Four thousand miles away, within the great Cascadian basin, lay the many cities of Centralis, which formed the economic and industrial core of the demon empire. Near the center of these lies the magnificent city of Celle, the capital.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWYzOTZhODdhYTRhODE5M2YwOWQ3MjFlNmJhNjZl">Within its districts of white and gold, at its highest point, sat the Cathedral of Bone, the empire's center of power. Within its bone walls, inside a room built from the remains of a titanic creature long forgotten to most of the world, sat a woman.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTUzZTc5ZTUzNjRmZmE5NDQ5ZTA1MDU1NzNkOWRj">Adorned in white clothes trimmed with gold thread, with blond hair and blue eyes, and two very small horns, so small that along with her pale skin, she could almost be mistaken as a human, sat the woman, sipping tea from a small cup.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzcxM2JhZDhlYTRiODVhMGMyODAzMzg2ZThkYWEz">She sat in perfect harmony with the world, for over the centuries it had long grown accustomed to her presence. The woman looked out the window at the empire beyond.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDQxNzNlYzM1NjQyNjI5MmI0MTRmODhkYjM3MTE1">Her empire.</p>
<p class="cnM3NzBiMThmNzIxYTRhMzA4MzNmN2IzMjM1NmQ1MTY0">Then, without warning, she froze and the small cup fell from her hand, shattering upon the floor. The maid in the room looked at the cup, and then at her master.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDI3NGM3NDNhMzRhZTBhZWFmMDk2ZDc5OGU4NzFk">“Divine One?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MjNiNDBhOTA3MjQ3ZWJiNTIyNjE2NzMwY2NkYmY3">“Theresa. Did you… hear something just now? Not in the aether, rather... in the mists?”</p>
<p class="cnM3Nzc2NzY0YjM4NzRkMmE5MTc5ODQzMmJjNmIxYmMw">“No, Divine One.” The maid was a triple-speaker, knowing the First Word of three distinct combat branches. “Is something the matter?”</p>
<p class="cnMzN2VjZjk0OGU5ZTRiOWM5MTRlYWE1OWIwNjkxYTFi">The smallest of smiles appeared on the woman's face.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTdiMThkNDI5MzRmZTk4MjcwMGE1MTkzNGFmYTZh">“A monster… has appeared.”</p>

      <description>Chapter Eight: What’s Chicken?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM2NmZmODAzZTk5NzQzNjI4ODY2YjQwZjhhMzY3Njdh"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMzYmE4OGZiNzM4YjQwYTdhMDdkYmZmMGIyYzY4NmNm">Serena woke to the familiar ceiling of wood and steel. She was somewhere in the <em>Vengeance</em>. The room was dim, the aetherlights having been turned down to their lowest setting. Was it nighttime? There were no windows to check. She was lying on a bed, not her usual hammock.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzQ3MWZjMWYyYzRhYWQ5ZjE0ZDgwNWM5MmNlOWJk">The medical wing.</p>
<p class="cnMzYWM0ZTBkMmU0NTRhOTVhYzhiODc5NjBlZjcwZmYy">Why was she here? Was she injured in battle? She couldn’t remember. Serena moved an arm and then cried out as the movement caused her skin to crack and bleed. Her cry of pain further caused her face to fracture. Through the blinding agony came a thought of understanding. Her soul had been damaged.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjRjNGU2ZjEwNjQ3Mzc4ZWQxNzk2ZGM3OGY3YzE0">She must have lost control of the Word.</p>
<p class="cnNjOWFjYmM1MzA5ODQxM2Y5NjMxZWQ0NzJlZDZiOTA5">Why? When had she Spoken?</p>
<p class="cnMyNTVlMjUyM2U5ZTRiOWRhOWVmZjg2NjY2OWFmZTM4">Serena tried to call for Anathor, but as she did a golden hue filled the room, mending her skin and dulling the pain. It was only a temporary measure, as soon as the warmth faded she could feel it building back up again.</p>
<p class="cnMwMGVlYjE3MDQ4MjQzOGNiYjMzYWE1MmM0NTY1NWVl">A soul damaged by divine possession was not so easily healed.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTRmZDBkOWFhNzQ5NDU5MzAyZjZiZTdkMDNkY2M1">“Sleep now, Captain. If you could…” came Anathor’s voice.</p>
<p class="cnNhN2I3M2E4Yzc3NzQ2OGU5MTk5ZDI5MjRmZDA5ODRl">And then a white fog clouded her eyes, as someone cast a sleep spell on her, sending her back to a deep slumber and the realm of dreams.</p>
<p class="cnNjZmJmYTZjYzE4MDQ2OTBhZTU1NmNmMTE1MDgxNDcy">Serena opened her eyes, finding herself standing in the main stairwell of the <em>Vengeance</em>. It was dark, the aetherlights not turned on, the only light from a greasy oil lantern hanging from the wall. The sounds of the ship, creaking and groaning, reached her ears, and the sound of… water? Her mind was muddled. What was happening? Were they sailing through a storm?<br/><br/>No… these were the sounds of… waves.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjdiNmJjOThkMzQyOWFiNjIxODQxOTRmZTcyYWE4">Not possible. The <em>Vengeance</em> was not a watership, and this was definitely her ship, she recognized the structure of the stairwell that went through the ship’s decks. But… where were the steel beams? Everything was wooden. Why did it look so… old?</p>
<p class="cnNmYmU4NmMzZTg1NjQ0MmNiNGI4OTBkNGRmNzIzOGJj">She tried to call for Anathor, but no sound came out.</p>
<p class="cnNlMTM2ZDQxOTI2ZjRkMWJhYmFlZDI0MGE5NTllMTVj">What deck was she on? A few hesitant steps later she found a door, and a familiar set of words was etched upon it.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjlkMGRlMTU5MTRhNWY4OGZkYTE2NTlhNjA4N2E2"><em>Fourth Deck</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTQ3YjExYTU4ZTRmODU5NjYxMjUxM2FjNjUxNjUz">It was slightly open.</p>
<p class="cnM5OTMzOTUwNmI5OTQzOGY4OWEwZThhZThjZWY2MDMz"><em>No…</em> Something in her mind warned her. <em>The door to the fourth deck is forever closed. It is off-limits, even to the captain.</em> The voice in her head felt unnatural. Were these even her thoughts? Who was speaking in her mind? <em>What is in there must never be allowed out</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM1OGJmODk2NTNmYjRlMDBhOTRhNTA3ZDk1ZTU5Mzlm">She reached out and pulled the door closed. Its handle was icy cold and the heavy thud of its closing reverberated in the space. Serena blinked and then looked down and saw she was holding the key.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTg3OTBhYzk4MzQzYWE5ZDQ1MTczZjRhOGY3NDUw"><em>Never use the key</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGFkYjFmNjdkYjQ0Mjk4ZjZhMzNjNmFlMjk2MmE4">Who used the key? Who opened the door to the fourth deck?</p>
<p class="cnM3ZWI0MzNjYjk0NTQxYmRiYTU1YWVhYTUwZjU3NWNi">It must be locked.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjgxYjA2MjBkZDQwMmRiM2RjNTcxNjc5ZTI5MGNl">The mechanism clicked as the lock engaged. As she pulled the key out she heard a voice talk to her in an ancient tongue. She did not know the name of the language, but the meaning and intention behind the words and their speaker were clear.</p>
<p class="cnNkMTZkMzA3MTc3NzRiYjBiZGY4ZGIzNzUzYTcxOTc1">“Bring me the girl,” said the ship.</p>
<p class="cnNlZGQxYzQwMjgxYTQzODJhNDFjNDE0MzM3YWRiNTIw"><em>Amelia!</em> Serena’s mind yelled out, as she was pulled from the dream into the waking world, a familiar ceiling of wood and steel greeting her. She tried to remember the dream, but it was like trying to grasp fog itself. It slipped from her mind and she soon gave up.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzRhNzg4OTQ0MDQ3Zjg5NTRiOWI3MmI5NDBlNzY5">How long had she been sleeping? With a cautious movement of a single finger, and then another, and then an arm she confirmed that her soul had somehow been healed, repaired from the divine energies that had fractured it.</p>
<p class="cnMwMjVhMTBlNDQwYjQ4ZDI5MmY5ZmU4NTE3ODU5YmU5">The room was lit, the aetherlights shining bright, meaning it must be daytime. Serena turned her head. The other beds in the room were empty. She was alone, apart from…</p>
<p class="cnMyZjVjYTFhMmVlYzRiZmVhMjFiYzc1YTQxNGYxODk5">“Mmm… fried chicken…”</p>
<p class="cnMzOTdlZDA0MDc0NjQ3NWY5OTBmYjc5NjA2MDE5N2Yw">She looked down at a familiar set of messy blond hair. Amelia was lying next to her, curled into a half ball, sucking on her thumb like a babe. Her other hand was resting on Serena’s left arm.</p>
<p class="cnNmMmUzNTY1YjQwYjQ0MmJhM2NkMjRhYjJmYmE5YmQ3">What in the seven hells was fried <em>chicken?</em></p>
<p class="cnNmMzdlMjgwYWIwMTQ1ZDlhYjBjNDQyMTg1ZjU2NjYz">Tsk! She forced herself to sit up, pushing with her hands and feet so her back was elevated against the pillows, the movement causing Amelia to mumble something else. Thankfully, despite a subtle sense of exhaustion, she felt pretty good! She wasn’t in pain, nor did she feel thirsty or hungry.</p>
<p class="cnMzNWFmMzgzM2EzNTRhZDY4NjEyZWY5MDc3ZTEyOWQz">Amelia had obviously played a part in healing her, that was without doubt. However… this <em>idiot human</em>! What was she doing, sleeping in the <em>same</em> bed as her!? She was nobility! And a woman! If word got out that she shared a bed with a human that… was almost <em>cuddling</em> her…</p>
<p class="cnMyMzIxMjhlZjE1OTRmNzQ5Y2YxY2FiNDZjM2NhYTli">“Wake up, idiot,” she said. Finding no response she looked for something she could stab her with. Unfortunately, her cutlass was nowhere to be seen so she had to make do with a finger, which she jabbed a few times into the messy blond hair.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzIxYWU3MDQ5NjQwNzZiOTllNmE4YzgzMTUzNjlm">“Wake. Up. Idiot.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YzQyMTZiMDQxMjQzOWFiOTNkOThmZTAyODI1NjJk">A pair of blue eyes slowly opened and then went wide like saucers. “You’re awake! Serena!” Exclaimed the astonished healer. Serena was about to chastise her for using her first name, but was stopped by a wave of gold and blue flowing into her, and as the warmth and light rippled through her body the last feeling of exhaustion left her.</p>
<p class="cnNiYjg5ZjI3YzY2ZjQxMDhiZmNjNTE2NTY4YTE3YTY3">“How are you feeling? Are you all… mended? Your soul?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNDA2NTExOWU1NjRlMDhiZDIwYTE4M2EzNmIxZGUz">“I think… it’s okay now. Thank you, Amelia.”</p>
<p class="cnNiZTc4YmQxYWIxZDQyMmU5MmViMzFiNjEzN2FlNTlk">“Mmm! I was so worried! Every time I healed you, you would start cracking and bleeding again! Narean really took you for a ride, eh?”</p>
<p class="cnNkODU1NTgyNjFkODQ3YTk5Zjk1YTNhMjYyZmVlODc0">Narean… Serena cast her mind to the demon god she had communed with. Why had she Spoken? Why had she lost control?</p>
<p class="cnNmMzAxYjVjYjM2NDQyNzc4YzhiZjgzOThjNzkxM2Ux">“What happened? Why did I Speak?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMGQ5NmQ3YzNkYjRlZmZiYTk2MDQzM2IzNDA1MmRl">“Korvus attacked you! A mutiny! His men also tried to shoot me! Can you believe that!? So rude…”</p>
<p class="cnNhMGRjOTc1NWY1NDQyY2NiNzA5OTgwMTg2YWJkMWQy">Ah, now she remembered - but, she had been the one to attack Korvus, not the other way around. An image flashed through her mind, of a blond figure lying unmoving on the floor of the square.</p>
<p class="cnM2NTVmMGZkYThmYzQ5ZDQ4ODIzZDZkMzI1N2QwNzEy">“You… were okay? I saw you get shot… you weren’t moving.”</p>
<p class="cnM5OGVhMGEwM2Q0NTQ5NjliN2JmNzZkNTdjMDcyZWI4">“Mmm! It was super confusing! I was bending over to heal someone, and then suddenly I just fell over! We found out they had used these huge…” Amelia sat up, spreading her arms wide, “...hunting rifles, with these massive iron slugs! All against me! My wards held just fine but the forces flipped me all about! Took me quite a while to figure out what had happened, and then you Spoke and blasted the whole square! I had to heal everyone all over again before coming to help you!”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDViYTg4MDVlMDQ5NTE5Njk0ZmUzYmZhMjJmOTE0">“I see… where is Korvus now?”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTZkNmYyZWI1NDRhNTU4ODEzMDI0YzcwYWYxYWFk">“Gone. The fleet arrived not long after, and took him as well as all the ground forces! I think… you’re in a lot of trouble. Dagon wouldn’t tell me much!”</p>
<p class="cnM3YjgzYTVhNDFiODQ4MTBiYzAxZTg5ODVmZGNlZDYw">Serena racked her mind, trying to remember the fight. After Korvus had Spoken his Word - <em>Bayle - </em>she had lost control, and everything after that was a blur. She had been… losing.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2RjZDU4YTk2NjQ0NzI4MmE1NTA0NWUyYWUyZmQ0">“Did you… win against Korvus?” She asked Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjIxNzVmMmQ5YjQ0MzBiMjdhYjI0NDQxMzNlYmIx">“Hell yeah!” Amelia said, cheerfully punctuating her words with two thumbs up, “Sorry… that’s an expression from my world. You were getting your arse kicked! I think if you were protected by anything less than blue aura you would have died before I got to you!”</p>
<p class="cnNjYmE1NWY4YjA0YTQyMzI4ZTc3ZTc1MDljN2NiMDA5">“Blue!” Serena exclaimed, “I was using <em>blue </em>aura?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYWMwMjY5NzE5NzRjNzA4ZDhmNDkzZDgyY2YzMTgw">“Yup!”</p>
<p class="cnM0NDRiNTU3MjNlMzRhYzg5ZjFmOTgwNGI2M2M3YTJj">That was a huge deal. She was already considered a talent amongst demons, having Spoken the First Word so quickly, but the boundary between warrior levels of aura, like mage circles, was tremendous and she had struggled to break past green.</p>
<p class="cnMwZTIxNGRhM2VmNTRhZTRiYzRiMzNmYjI2OGNlNzBl">Now she had done it once, even if she hadn’t been in control, she would be able to do it again. Yet, it still hadn’t been enough. Korvus had been winning, his own talent had exceeded her. Or… was it a difference in talent? Had he simply been more determined? To see things through to the end?</p><span class="cjQwMDQ2OGZhZmU1NDQwMTc4MWJiODg0ZWZjZjVkYjdj"><br/>The story has been taken without consent; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNiZTBkNWNmNWMyYTRiMzlhNGE2ODUwNWNjZDAxMzUx">“Did you… Speak against Korvus?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTJiYzI2NGYyNjQ0NTM4Njg2YWZjNWQ5ZTc2Nzc3">“Well…” Amelia closed her mouth in thought, a finger resting against her chin. “I suppose I did… but!” She said, pointing at Serena, finger-wagging, “Don’t tell anyone I did! I think everyone knows I’m a Speaker by now anyway. Some scary guy called the <em>Dragon</em> was trying-”</p>
<p class="cnM3YjYzYTc4OWQyZjRiN2VhYWE1ODlmOGMxNGFmZGQx">“<em>The Dragon was here!?</em>”</p>
<p class="cnM5NGZjNTE4MjA1ZjQ2OGNiYmExMTZhYjY3MDc5YTlh">“Ooh, the Dragon, the Dragon!” Amelia waved her hands in the air, “Everyone’s going on about the <em>Dragon</em>! He didn’t feel like all that much to me!”</p>
<p class="cnMwMmUwMmExYzkyYzQ2ZThiYTBjYWJkMDA5NWUzY2Yx">This idiot human.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjAwNmJjZjhmNzQzOWM4NjdlZGI0MTA3ZGYxYTBi">“Is he still here?”</p>
<p class="cnMwODk1Y2ZlNjdkOTRkMWViNmRhZDFmNDc0ZTk0ZmIz">“Nah, he left. He tried to come down here but apparently, the ship wouldn’t open the door for him.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MmI4NWYxYjc0NTRkYjVhMWU1MmU5ODhlZTk5Yjhl">Problems upon problems. The Dragon was a Highlord of Cascadia, and whilst he was relatively unknown before the war - his political acumen had allowed him to collect no small amount of wartime powers bestowed upon him by his Overlord. It was said the only thing holding back his promotion to Greatlord, was his personal fighting capabilities.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzU2MWQyY2JhNjRmNTQ4M2E1Y2RmNjk0ODVjMDNm">She filed the Dragon away as to yet another problem that needed to be solved in the future.</p>
<p class="cnNjNDJiNGZjN2UyZDQ2OGQ4OWQzMmFhMWNiNGYwYjc5">“Let’s go back a bit. Korvus. How did you win against him?” There was no way that <em>Aseco</em> could win against <em>Bayle</em> in combat.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmRmNDk0N2ZmNzRlNGY5OTJjYTQyNTMzNzA0ZjY0">“Well, remember when I said I had a few tricks up my sleeve?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZjg3YjBmZjVmNTQyNTg5M2ZkOTQyMDM3NzNjNzMx">“... I see.” She looked at Amelia for a few moments. “I suppose you aren’t willing to share further?”</p>
<p class="cnMyZmQ4ODYzYTI0NTQyNDZhMzQxOTMxZDRjZWU5Y2Vi">“Depends. How much more are you going to pay me?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTg1NTU5MmFmYjRiOGM4MWM0ZDYxOWRlNjE4ZDcx">“Ha!” Serena couldn’t stop herself from laughing. Never before had someone spoken to her so candidly, even when she was at the military academy, her closest classmates would still watch their behavior out of respect for who her father was.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjkyMDhmNDdjYzRmNjliMzUyNmQ1Njk3M2VmZjgy">She couldn’t deny it. It was somewhat refreshing. It felt… friendly.</p>
<p class="cnM0MThiOWY1OGQyMTQyOTc4Zjk3YmZmMzgzNjBlMWQ5">“Stupid human,” she said.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzQ1NzVhMzNiZjRkZTY4ZTE1NTU0ZGQ1NTI1ZDcw">“Stupid demon,” came the reply.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWFjMWQ3NmU2MzRhNmE5M2Q0MTUyYWVlNjhhZTQ4">“Yes, I am,” she said, “I underestimated the attitudes of Korvus and those loyal to him. I thought they would come around in time, but time was not something we had. Korvus is incapable of trusting a human, or living with them. I didn’t understand this, or rather, I chose not to believe it. I must have looked insane in his eyes, to see me bringing what he thought was a powerful enemy in our midst after only knowing you for <em>hours</em>. He thought I had been bewitched… maybe I was.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGFiMjFiZWRmMTQ4YzU4NWU0ODRkYjliOWRhOWI3">“Well, I am <em>awfully</em> cute, aren’t I? Ow!” Another finger jab put an end to that.</p>
<p class="cnM5OTk5NmYzZGRiNjRhYTBhN2IwMmQ2MDY4MmIwNDIw">Suddenly, the door to the room was open and a demon appeared.</p>
<p class="cnM1MmYxZGIwZDVlOTQxMTViNmU4NDVhODNiZjk0YjAw">“Captain!” Exclaimed Dagon, “You’re awake!”</p>
<p class="cnNlOTdiNDUxNTg0MTQ3ZGY4MTRkNzFiMWQwODI1OGRi">“Still alive,” she grumbled. “Heard the Dragon made an appearance.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NDM2NjhkZDkyZjQ4MDQ5ZDcyM2ZkMmFhYzZkZDRi">Dagon nodded and then cast a questioning eye toward Amelia and then back to Serena.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTY0OGNhMzBjNDQyYTc4NDg0OTBlMDVmNDBiZDVl">“Amelia, go wait in my quarters.” The human yawned in a manner wholly unsuitable for polite company with nobility. Standing up she took a piece of elastic and started to tie her hair back.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjUwYzg0OGZhMTQ2MzI5OGE0OGZjZDdhZTZkY2Fj">“Alright, but let Anathor know if you start feeling pain and I’ll come right back, or I could heal you from a distance I suppose… either way let him know and he’ll tell me!”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjJhZjA4YjIzMDQyMWZhOGJlMzc2YTNkZWY0NjM1">“... Thank you.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNDM5MzNhNzg0MjQ2Yjc4MDQ2MzI2N2VlZDg5YzIw">“Bye!” Amelia gave her a wave and skipped out of the room, ponytail bouncing, Dagon and Serena watched her go, not continuing their conversation until the sound of her footsteps grew faint.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDNiNzY1NDc0MTQ1NmY4ZmM0ZDk1NGI5MGZlMTNi">“She’s barely left your side all week.”</p>
<p class="cnNiOWI0NTY4ZDU0YTRlNzk4ZTE1NDRmNzJjOGE4YTc3">“All <em>week!?</em> How long have I been here?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZjJiN2YwZTkxYTQ3NzRiZjdhOWNmZDlkNzM4YWUy">“Six days, Captain. First three days she didn’t leave this room once, didn’t eat, drink, or sleep. Kept herself going by healing herself. Said she couldn’t leave you for a moment. She cried a bit… a lot.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYzQ3ZmFiMjBiMTQzZDU5ZWM3NDkwZTI1MWY2OGI2">“... I see.” Something in her heart moved at that. Annoying.</p>
<p class="cnNhYWE1YzJjYTEyZjQ0MDM5MGM4YTZlMTYzZTEwM2Uz">“During the first day, the moment she stopped healing you your skin would start cracking and you’d bleed everywhere. Her magic must regenerate blood or something because I’m pretty sure there was more out of you than could ever be inside you. Wasn’t until the second day it slowed down, and on the third day Hillbrand was finally able to convince her to leave your side. She’s set up in your quarters.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYmEwNWU4MWZhYTRhNWE5YTI3YzNiZTY2ZWIwNTlk">“That bad, huh.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NDA4NDk1YjllNTQ2NjJiNWNkYWM5MTE1YjQ1MjZm">“Aye, that bad,” Dagon said, scratching his chin. “What happened, Captain? Korvus try and kill you over the girl?”</p>
<p class="cnM4NTg0M2NmZjY5ZTQzYjhiNDU3OWY3NjgwOTBjZTk4">“... not quite. I’m not even sure he was going to attack me. I saw him give the command, for his men to assassinate her and…” She gave a small shrug, “I over-reacted.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YmYxMDVhYTgxYTQzMmU5ZWZlOTEzYjI5ZjQ1ZmQw">“Yeah, you sure did. You want the good news, before the bad?”</p>
<p class="cnM1OTgyMjNjM2IwYTQ3MGY4YTZmNWMxOTYzZjIwN2I3">“Go for it.”</p>
<p class="cnM4YjJjY2UyYzJjODRmYmJiNWU3OGM0NDg5YTM1MDdj">“Good news is over the last week the crew has somewhat taken to tolerating, even liking the human. The fact she cured all their broken bones after you Spoke, and then literally saved your life has turned most of their opinions positive. That’s that. No more good news. The rest of it's bad.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNGZiZjZjMjc5YTRkYzM5M2ExZThkZTNhZDc0M2Zl">“The Dragon?”</p>
<p class="cnNmOGMyZjViODE4OTQ5YTk5ZWQzZGNhZTEzZTQyNjcx">“The admiral wanted to put both you and her in cells. Sent a squad of soldiers to get you two. Ship stopped them. The Dragon appeared. Ship stopped him. I got my balls blasted in front of every officer on the ship. They took Korvus, and disbanded our ground forces.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OGJmODY5NzNkNDRkMzQ5NjBlM2VjMGRhMDc5ZWJh">“What happened to the others involved in Korvus’s plot?”</p>
<p class="cnNhYmEyMmM4M2ViZDRkOWZhM2IxZDNiNDhkNWJhZjgx">“Hanged them. Bodies committed to the <em>undersky</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNlZmQ3MTVjODMyMzRmYWJiYWU0Y2Q3YjJhZjAwOTIz">“How’d the crew take that?”</p>
<p class="cnM0NmI3ZGRlNDAxMDRiZmNhMjQ2OWMxNTM3OTJiZTkz">“Eh, this and that,” Dagon said, mimicking a set of scales with his palms, “I framed the entire thing as a mutiny - which I suppose it was, somewhat - orchestrated by Korvus and supported by his loyal ground forces. You know how there’s always been friction between the sailors and the soldiers… still, the hanging was a solemn affair, thought it best to get it over and done with as soon as possible, rather than wait for you to wake up.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNTY5MWIwZTQzYjQ4YjE4ZGM0ZjdiNDAzNGE5OTM5">“How did Amelia react? Would have thought that idiot would try to interfere.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNWI1YTM3NDg1NDQ0MjZhODFkYzA4NDdmNmE2MDg0">“Thought so too, but she seemed content on letting it happen. Wouldn’t watch, though. I think the whole series of events has affected her more than she’s let on. Like I said, she cried a lot.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MjRlYzFlODg1ZjQxYThhN2E4Mjg0MTgyODc4YTA5">“Well, from what we know, she’s never seen or been in war. A lot of things must be a surprise,” Serena said, Dagon nodding in agreement. “Anything else?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNGY0YjgzZGVmMTRiYjliMDZlMTE0MjBhOTE1OWZl">“The Dragon thinks she’s <em>at least</em> a double-speaker. At least.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNTc2NTMyZWRiNzQ2Nzg5ZmY2NTU2MmJhNjE0NjRh">“Why?” She narrowed her eyes. She had suspected the same, especially after Amelia had admitted she had Spoken <em>something</em> to fight Korvus.</p>
<p class="cnM3N2ZmODU2OWJiYzQwMTc4NTg5MzRhYjVmMzgzOTM4">“The fleet’s aetherscopes only picked up your Word, and then Korvus’s. They didn’t pick up anything Spoken from the girl.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMjkyYjhiMGJjMTQ2YTVhMzU2NGM4ZDhkOTU4ZTA2">“That’s not possible,” Serena said, shaking her head, “Their aetherscopes must have missed her Speaking. She took care of <em>Korvus</em>! He was a fifth-level warrior, almost sixth! Even accounting for the general increase in abilities from communing with more than one god, she would have still needed to Speak to contend with him.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjExNGMzMGVhZjQwOTY5OTI1NTE1N2VmNzg1NWE0">“Right, that’s what I said to Tomes after the meeting. This girl… she’s already pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. We don’t know what’s normal in the world she came from.” Dagon twiddled his thumbs, furrowing his brow. “We got talking, me and Tomes, and we were thinking that… you know… what thinking about her abilities and all… that maybe it’s not a matter of her being able to Speak the First Word of a branch or two, or even <em>three</em>. Maybe it’s something bigger than that. Maybe she can Speak the Se-”</p>
<p class="cnMzOTE0MGY5YmNhNTRjZmRhZGNlMWZlNDg2MmZmNThh">“Stop. Don’t go down that path, Dagon,” she warned. “And tell Tomes I said that. He tried to bring up the same subject before. Thankfully, he had the sense not to pursue it, sense that I hope you have too.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNTUzNjcxNTJkOTQ3NGM4MTFiODMzODc1MTM1Mzdm">“I… sorry, Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MzExOGE0YmJlMTQ2ZGI5N2VkMDE0Mjc0OGJkODFl">“She likely has a way to limit or maybe even hide the aether release, the grandmaster at the academy could do it. Apparently, all of the Empress’ Lord Guardians have the ability. We can dig into it later, but for now, assume she covertly Spoke a Word from a human combat branch. Do we have a record of known human Words?”</p>
<p class="cnMxNGUwNzVmYWY5ZTQ2ZTE5NmRjMTllMjQzNTE4Zjkz">“Aye, Tomes has one somewhere.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MmM4OTExYzA0YzQ3ZmJhY2NhMDk3Y2YyZWIxM2Vh">“Next time you see him, tell him to send it to my quarters. I’ll ask Amelia about it. I don’t think she would lie, she doesn’t seem to like it, which is why it’s <em>so dangerous</em> and <em>important</em> that you <em>never</em> go down that previous line of questioning with her.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MzRlODVjNmJmNzRmMThiMDAxNTgyZjI3MWI0YjI0">“... Yes, Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MzA4NTdlZTNlNzQwOTRhNDRhZjg2ZDRhZTY4NmM0">“Now… back to something less concerning. Anything else from the Dragon?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMGYxYzMzNjAwNDQ3ODU5MmM1MTA4NGJkZWVmZTA5">“We’re to sail to Kenhoro, finish repairs there, get a new turret installed. Could be a chance to pick up some of those fancy new propellers Tomes was going on about.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NjUwMWVjZTE0ZTQ5NzhhNzhlNGM0NjYxOGRhNWY1">“Yeah,” Serena nodded. Tomes had mentioned he had come across some propellers that helped prevent cavitation. It would be a useful upgrade for when they went swimming in the lumina. “And then, await orders?”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDM5NTZjOTdjYzQ1NjliYmFkMWFmYmMzZmVjMTQ0">“Afraid not. Got to sail to Shimashina after.”</p>
<p class="cnNjZmRhYTFiOGRjMjQzMWNhMTA2OTQ5ZjdkNWUwN2E3">“Fuck.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMTE2OWRmNjE3YTQzNDRhN2I1YzJlYmE3ZmQ5NDc1">“Yeah. Your old man wants to see you.” Dagon sighed. “And… the girl.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTUzMGM4MjdlOTRlZWNhNjIyMzYxNjkwMDYxMGQ5">“Seven hells!” Serena resisted the temptation to grab her horns. “That…” She trailed off, pausing. It <em>would</em> be nice to see her family again.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTJkMGY5MDI1YzQ2NjQ4ZGM5NDExNTI2NWEzMDcy">Some of them.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjg1Yjk3ODY1MzQyYWQ5OTJhNTE0MjkxOTdhOWEy">“We must be getting close to Kenhoro, if I’ve been out six days.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZTJlY2NlNWUzZDRhOWE4NDQ1MjA3MWYzNjg1NGRk">“Aye, Captain. Two days out. We’re well into Imperial airspace. Ship’s on low alert. Getting some washing done. Thought it best to take it easy on the crew, after the hangings and all that. Morale is a little low, to be honest. Are you feeling able?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNzc4MTYxYjU3YjRlNDFhMjRlNjk1ODU4NjJmN2Y3">“I’m good now, thanks to Amelia,” she said. Serena swung her legs off the side of the bed and stood up. After that last bout of healing, she didn’t feel weak at all. She looked down at her feet and…</p>
<p class="cnMxYmUyZDZhMTI4OTQyYWFiMDA2ZWJmMDZiYmY0NjQx">“Where the hell is my uniform?” She was wearing a white shirt and trousers, very different from her usual black and gold captain's outfit.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGMwMDk4YTdkNTQ0OWJiZjVmM2EzODk3NDFlZTc4">“Was burned and shredded during the fighting. There’s a spare set around here somewhere…” Dagon dug around in some drawers before pulling out a familiar set of clothes. “Here, Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDFhNjc5YzU5YjRlMzY5NTA3YzdjNzZjNWUyYWRm">“Anathor! Gather the officers on the bridge.”</p>
<p class="cnMwOWZmZWM5OTRjYjQ5ZTJiZDViMDA3ZjkzMWUxMzA0">“Very well…” came the gruff reply. Serena turned and gave a pointed look at Dagon, who stared back at her. She sighed.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmFkODA3YzI0NTQxYTY4OTJhNjkyZjI4NmZjYmMx"><em>Men</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNmNWY2N2MzOGJlYTQ5NGRiMWM2NmYyNDI5N2MxMDc3">“Dagon.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjQ2MjJkOGU0NDRlNDNhZmUwZTQ0ZmZkMDdlM2Fj">“Yes, Captain?”</p>
<p class="cnM4M2Y3ZDcxOGUxZjQ5MTZhNmY1Zjg1MmEwOWM5NzAx">“Get out.” She motioned to the uniform in his hands.</p>
<p class="cnNhYWZiNWZlZjRlYTQzNTM5ZWMxNTJjNjFlMTRjMzhh">“Ah! Sorry, Captain! I’ll be outside!” He hurriedly placed the uniform on the bed before making himself scarce and closing the door.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzY2MWM3Mzk2MzQwOWRiZDNhNGNhMDYzMjgwZjMx">Idiot. She found a basin of water, wetted a towel, and began cleaning her body. There didn’t seem to be too much sweat or dried blood, had Amelia and Hillbrand washed her, or did Amelia have some kind of cleaning spell? It would not surprise her, not anymore.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGRhNTBjNzA1YzQ2NGJhMjRhOGQxYzliNWNjOWFj">“Anathor,” she said, “have you ever heard of <em>chicken</em>?” Serena wouldn’t change in front of Dagon, but she had long accepted that Anathor could and would see everything at some point. He had assured her previously that he had no interest in those things, and it wasn’t like she could leave the ship every time she wanted to wash herself.</p>
<p class="cnNkMWZhNjJkMWFlNTRlMzBhMGI0ODY1NGMyM2Y4MDEw">“Hmm…” came the reply. “A flightless bird. Extinct in this realm. From pre-Cascadian times, of the old human kingdoms that formed from the initial wave of colonialism more than two thousand years ago.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NzViMjhkMzlkYzQ3YWY4YjlkNGQyNTlmNjVjM2M0">“That long ago?” She asked, pausing her changing. Anathor was old, he had hinted at it a few times, but pre-Cascadian, before the demon empire was formed? Was it possible?</p>
<p class="cnMzMDI5OTAwZWU4ZjRmMGE4OWUwODhmZTJmMWZhZjgx">“How do you know?” She asked, “Have you… seen them?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZjBkMGM0YTcxMTQxZjM4ZTRmNjRiYzdiZjcxZWQ0">“Hmm… I do not know. There is a memory, but I don’t know if it’s mine or if it’s… never mind…” He trailed off for a moment. “However, I believe the chocos popular in the Northern Terra Firma and Centralis are a descendant species.”</p>
<p class="cnMwN2I5ZDZhMmQzZDRkODk5YWY5NGNlZTUwMzg5YzY4">“Oh, chickens are an ancestor of chocos? That’s interesting. I’ll have her try one, see if she thinks it tastes similar.” Then, a thought arrived. “Anathor, could Amelia be from the original world of humans? From which those caravans arrived?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMGExMjliNTA4MjQxYmE4NTdjYjFmMTIwNDQ5ZWMx">“Unlikely. That world was sealed from realm travel shortly after they arrived, by forces incomprehensibly more powerful than the gods you all Speak the names of.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMzRiNGZmNGEyNDRhNDQ5NmE0ZWE2ODVmOGI4Njll">Suddenly, something Anathor had said to her when she had first discovered Amelia in her quarters a week ago came to mind.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2Y3ZWMxNzNiNjQyNDg4OTc4MTNhNjJmMDc3YjA0">“Powerful enough… to fool your eyes, and the ship's?”</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2VjYTJlN2RmMjQxMzA5ZWZiYzc5ZmEzMDY4OWU0">“Hmm… the ship cannot be fooled.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NTVkYThkNjE0YjRkYmU4YTQyNWJkYzkyNGU5ODgz">The ship… the fourth deck… there was something about the fourth deck that she had forgotten. Tsk! It can’t have been important. Serena finished changing.</p>
<p class="cnMzMWY3Yjk1NzY1NTQzYWNiMDNhMTY4MjI1N2MyZGJi">“How do I look?”</p>
<p class="cnMyOThmMTQ2OTg2ZDQzMTliMGVlOWM4YTkxODFmZWMw">“Hmm… happy.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MjkwN2IwMjRiNjQwOGNhNGQwODRiZmQxYWQ1YmQ1">“Happy? I wasn’t expecting that.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMGQ1NWQ4YmM1MDQ0OThiMTE0NGY3ZjY4NzFjZTgx">“You often seem happy after talking with the human.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMDg2Y2EwODQzMjRjNGRhYmQ0YzVhMTIxNjJhOWY3">“... keep those thoughts to yourself.”</p>
<p class="cnMyZTRkMWI5OWI1YzQ5ZDM4NDU5YjE0MDZkYzM5ZDEy">“Yes, Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmZhMjNjZTliNDRhYjJhOTFjNTA2MDU1Yzg2OTVl">She exited the medical wing, meeting Dagon in the corridor. Together they headed to the bridge, and Dagon was giving her a run-down of the smaller things that had happened on the ship over the time she had been healing, however, most of it went through one ear and out the other. Her mind was preoccupied with what Anathor had said.</p>
<p class="cnNiOGVjMGMwZTBlZTQ0ZWQ4OGU5ZDczMTc2MGUwNTc3">Amelia made her… happy?</p>

      <description>Chapter Nine: Arcwhale</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM5NDEyMDRiMTZmMDRhNjdhMjFhMjNiNmJmMDJkNzQz"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMzMTAzM2I2YWZkZjRhNzJhYTliYzZiMzI1ZDAwZmYy">“Dismissed!”</p>
<p class="cnNiOThjYmMxMjk4ODQ4MTNiNDJjYTAzM2FlZGQzMGE1">The officers on the bridge returned to their stations. There was a feeling of relief among the soldiers, seeing Serena fully functional and barking orders, as usual, did wonders for their morale. A crew with a captain who was unconscious for an unknown length of time was a tenuous situation, especially post-mutiny.</p>
<p class="cnNjM2I1NTgxNTYyMjRjOWY5MGVjMWRjZDNiZGNmZWJh">The demons on the bridge chatted amicably amongst themselves, whilst the air and ground tacticians did what they usually did and debated hypothetical scenarios. Although their ground forces had been disbanded by the Dragon, the ground tactician was technically part of the navy and not the army and had thus remained. His acumen of human defensive strategies would be invaluable in planning future missions of all kinds.</p>
<p class="cnM4NDdhZGVjZDE3NDRkNDFhYzMwOTU1YmFmMjUzN2Fh">They were well into Imperial airspace, and their aetherscopes were picking up frequent transport ships of both military and civilian origin. The atmosphere was casual, the pre-battle tensions long gone. Now with days of free time behind and in front of them, her sailors would be occupying themselves, whether relaxing in the mess hall, napping in their quarters, or - as she could see through the bridge windows - doing washing.</p>
<p class="cnM0MGM3YzY2Y2QxNDQ2ZjA5NzhhMTQwZjE4MDk4ZTNj">Now the hole from the torpedo had been patched up, the deck was open for the sailors to get some fresh air and hang their clothes and uniforms to dry. Washing lines went from the gun barrels to the deck railing and from there to the long beams of the port and starboard sails, which were fully deployed.</p>
<p class="cnM5NmNjOWYyMTAxNzQ1NTViM2E1MjJiZjM1ZDhhZDAz">The propulsion engine was inactive, and the ship was sailing on just the trade winds that would take them to the Imperial airdocks in Kenhoro. A dozen sails, six port side, and six starboard side caught the midsky winds and kept them at a modest fourteen knots, all without a gram of crystal fuel being burned.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2MxNzNkZGYxODQ0YzBiNjAyYTY4ZThlZjdhYTAx">“Thorne, Allston, with me,” she said, and her gunnery officer and chief engineer fell in behind her as she approached the repair job on the deck. As the sailors saw her emerge on deck a ripple of cheers erupted.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTczZWQ4OGIwNTQzOWRhY2FlMTgwZDUwM2Q3NjFm">“Cap’n!”</p>
<p class="cnNkOGVmZWIwZjNhODRmYTA4MDIwOWM2Zjc5NjA2MGIw">“Welcome back!”</p>
<p class="cnM5OGUyOWE1OTUxMTQ2NzhiM2I4NDI4YTg0M2IwMjc0">“That human earned her keep, eh?”</p>
<p class="cnNkODZhNzBmOTdkMDRiMTE4NTdmNGY0YWQ3ZjljNDY1">She accepted the comments with a raised hand, “Thought about dying,” she exclaimed, “But then I couldn’t bear the thought of leaving your old horns under Dagon’s command!” That earned a bit of laughter - morale wasn’t at rock bottom then.</p>
<p class="cnM3MzU1ZDc0ODAwMzRjMGZhMDQwZTQyNTA1NzllNTky">Serena came to a stop at the former location of turret three. Steel plates had been welded by the fire mages, forming a relatively thin covering of half-inch thick metal.</p>
<p class="cnMzZTZkOTEzMGZiNzQwYzlhZGRkZDc5MzhlMDEyYWRj">“How long for a full repair, Allston?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjRjNDMyNGFhNTRkMTg4MGYwMTQ5ZDc5ZjQxNzRk">“Three weeks, maybe four at Kenhoro, where we have access to their steel and cranes,” grumbled the chief engineer. “The main deck girders and heavy plates need replacing, but the wooden flooring and walls can be finished on the move. Decks one, two, and three need most of the work. Minor work on deck five. As for deck four… guess it’s true what you told us, that it’ll take more than a battleship shell to get in there.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OGFiOThhYjkyYjRmYzRiODQ4YTNhYzk5MGE0YmU0">“In this case, more than that new torpedo they have.” Dagon had informed her that he had given the fleet a full report of what they encountered, unfortunately, the only documents they had regarding the new weapon were stored in the pocket of her uniform and didn’t survive the battle with Korvus.</p>
<p class="cnNmOWQ1Yjc1MGJjNDQzNThhZmE1M2Y5NzYyNmVjZjg4">“We’re damn lucky Anathor and the ship closed the bulkheads before the secondaries detonated. Saved the turrets from chain reacting. Could have lost the ship.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNjQ1MDQ5NGRhNTQzZGFiYTZjNDgxMTA4YWE4ZWI3">“Damage to turrets one and two?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMWYzZDk4Y2I5OTQ0YTliMGQ1Mzk1MmZiNWI1ZGVk">“Nothing other but some light maintenance we finished a few days ago,” Allston said.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzBlM2Y0NjE4NDRlZmY5OGFlZjRjOTUxM2Y0NTZi">“Did some test firings while you were recovering, Captain,” said Thorne, the weapons officer. “All green. Need to come to a decision about what we’re going to replace turret three with.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MzZiZDc3NDdkZjRjOWZhZGM1NDhlMGVjMmIzZDZk">Serena nodded, the twin-barrel four-inch batteries had served them well but were nearly seven years old now. There had been numerous advances in ship warfare, as both demon and humankind had sought to find every edge they could over the other.</p>
<p class="cnMxNWZjZDhkNzU1YzRkMGRiYjkzNGI0MGM5YjY4MzMy">“Any recommendations?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMDJkY2RhNjUxNTQyNDY4YjYxMWY0MmJlZmRiZGNh">“Been talking with the tacticians about it. Given how light craft is getting more numerous these days, and especially considering they’re now carrying torpedoes, we should consider a heavy flak battery instead of an artillery piece.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNjkwOWU3NjU0MjQwMjc5ZWYxNzA5NTljMDZjNjgw">“Any come to mind?” The standardization of weapon sizes and fittings had become more and more simple over the last decade, as the Imperial Navy had sought to modularize its equipment. The turret pods they had were compatible with a growing range of standardized cruiser-class weapons.</p>
<p class="cnNhNGMzMzIwZjU5YTRmNjY4YWIxNDY4NmM4N2UzYmYy">“We’ll only be able to choose from what’s stored in the armory in Kenhoro, unless we can delay long enough to order something from Tanhae, or eastern Centralis. Ideally, they’ll have a six-barrelled two-inch system, if not we’ll definitely be able to find a quad-barrelled piece. Heard the latest flak can output three shells per second, per barrel.”</p>
<p class="cnNhOWJlYTY4NjZhMzQ3NThiMWY1YzBiNDhhZjhkODlm">That would be twelve heavy flak shells a second for a quad-barrel, or eighteen per second from a six-barrel system. A two-inch flak shell had an effective fragmentation range of ten to twenty meters, depending on the characteristics of the shell itself. If they could fire eighteen a second, they would barely need to aim to paint the sky in metal.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjNlZmZiYTBmYTQ2NmM4NzQyNDZkZTgxY2MxMDZm">“Alternatively,” mused Thorne, “Torpedos are pretty accurate these days. Could see if we could put a launcher in, if they have any… Rumour is the brains in the Centralis workshops are close to figuring out how to get the torpedoes to track the aetheric combustion signature of the enemy ship automatically.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NjdlYTZmNDMwNzRkNmQ5ZTFjMjJjNjc0YzIxMTEz">Now that would be a game-changer. Didn’t her sister mention she was working on something torpedo-related? Serena made a mental note to ask her the next time they were face-to-face.</p>
<p class="cnMxODU1MmRkY2NmYzQ1ZGU4NWY1YTc4MDE0YmRhM2Jh">“We’ll see. I’ll find time tomorrow to go over the strategies with you and the tacticians. Since we don’t have ground forces anymore I don’t think they intend to use us as a hammer in the future. Suspect we might be getting something different.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMTY3NDcxNDRkZDRjYWFiZDVjMzk0ZDNkMDU5ZDQ2"><em>If I’m not dishonorably discharged,</em> she thought.</p>
<p class="cnM4ODE4Njg5ZGI0NjRmM2VhMjQzMzkzMzZiODgxNzdi">“At ease, Officers,” she said, leaving after they saluted her.</p>
<p class="cnM0N2UxZGI2ZTUwNzQyYzhhNGZiOTYzZDg0NWJmMDU0">She made her way to the captain's quarters, greeting numerous demons along the way who were all pleased to see her up and about. Arriving at the door to her office, she hesitated for a moment before going in.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWM2ZjFiMmJiMjRiMmU4NTBhZmMwOTkyMWE5ZjRj">It was just as she remembered it, although thoroughly empty of one <em>Amelia Thornheart</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM2YzRmMTA4ZWE3YzRjMWNhYjA2NTNjZDQ1YWQwYjQ0">“In here!” came the now familiar cheerful voice.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTA4NzI0ZDk3OTRjMGNiNTZmNDRjOWRkOWY5ZWVh">She found Amelia in the only other room connected to her office, her personal bedroom. The human was lying on a hammock she had set up, waving at her with a smile on her face.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDllMzkwNTViZTRhMzI5MzQ0NGQ2ZTM3ZjZkOWU3">“Did you… need to set up your hammock right next to mine?” She asked, casting a suspicious eye towards the grinning woman.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjcyODNiNDQ0NzQzNTU5ZjY1ZjlmNWEzZmRjOGE3">“I had no choice! Can’t tie it to that beam, as I’ll bump against the furniture, and can’t use that one as it would block the door to the washroom!”</p>
<p class="cnM3NjQ4MWZmM2I3NTQ2MGZhYTczMzcwNDhmNzUzNjRm">The explanation seemed plausible, so Serena let the matter drop. She lay down in her own hammock, and they both rocked gently in silence for a minute.</p>
<p class="cnM4MjgyZmJlZGM3MTRhOGJhMzcyMDIxZmRiMzRmN2Zi">“Thank you again, for what you did,” she said softly, “You saved my life.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMWVlYjAzZjgxYTRkNDU5ZGRmN2VmZDFlNzFjMDdl">“Mmm…” mumbled Amelia, but was no more forthcoming than that.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzE0NTZkYTA4ZjQxMjI4NDBjNzkxYWQzODViZjkx">“Although, if asked about it, don’t mention you slept in the same bed as me for three days.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYjYxNTI4ZmNmYjQyYjY4OGU2ZTU5MTBhYTZjYjJk">“Why?”</p>
<p class="cnNhOTNlODc2N2NkYTRmYzJhZDFjYWU4NGU1Yjc4YWQz">“I’m a noble, and rumors about me affect the standing of my family, my father, and my sisters. It would cause problems if such things became common knowledge. The fact you’re a human just complicates things further. The gossip would be unbearable.”</p>
<p class="cnMxN2E3NzRkM2E5YTQzYzM4N2FhM2Q5N2VjZmJiYzIz">“Even if it was because I needed to be close, to keep healing you?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNjkyMzQ1YmRmYzQxN2I5ZjdlNjViMDhlNjkzNzRk"><em>Was that really why?</em> That was what she wanted to ask, but stopped herself. Doubts quickly formed in her mind - why <em>did</em> she want to ask that question? Was she hoping for a different answer? Why was it so relaxing for her mind to lay here… talking to Amelia?</p>
<p class="cnNiODhmODhhMTk0NTQzYzI5Mjk0OTg4ZGM3M2U4NmQ2">“Yes… my family has enemies that would love the opportunity to harm us in any way.”</p>
<p class="cnNjY2NkMjVmMzFmMjQ5NzJiYzNhY2UxNTVhNWUzZmE0">“Wow, what a bunch of losers. Hey,” Amelia said, and the rustle of cloth let Serena know she had turned to face her. Should she keep looking up at the ceiling, or turn to face her? Why was she debating this!? Why was it suddenly so awkward!? “... so you must be super important, right?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NjVmYjlkN2YyNTQzNGE5MDA5YTYxOWJhYzAzYTll">“... Yeah,” Serena answered to the ceiling. She was the daughter of her father, a talented speaker and captain of the infamous <em>Vengeance</em>. It wasn’t her ego talking to say she was important in some circles.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzhjOTM0ODI3NTQ2MGZhZThiMjcxZjI4MTAwNGQ0">“And your family? Are they all… like you?”</p>
<p class="cnMwODMzZThlMzY3OTRmMTRhOTEzYmU3NTE5M2U1Y2Ex">“Like me?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YjI3MDI5MjMzYzRkN2E5ODQ2MDQ0Y2Q1ZGQ0ZmQx">“You know, hot-headed, sword-waving, order-giving grumpy demons?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NTllN2U5ZDM5ZTQwY2E4Y2VlYjVjMjU4NzliZGU0">“Pfft!” She couldn’t stop herself snorting at that, and then flushing with embarrassment as she made such an impolite sound. Strangely, she felt no urge to chastise Amelia. Why was she this comfortable around her? It was like… she was…</p><span class="cjU3MWY3OGRkODA4NTQyZDhiNzM4NGYyM2UyNDM2ZTUy"><br/>Unauthorized content usage: if you discover this narrative on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkNzQ1MjA4MGJiZjQ2NTA4NTliYTNjM2NjZTQ3OGVk">A friend.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjIzYmNhMGIwMzQzMjdiY2E1NjQwZGJiMGRjYzY0">“A little, although my sisters don’t wave swords, but my father taught me everything I know, including how to be… a grumpy captain, as you put it.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYmVjYmE5YTQzOTQzZTc5M2RjZGU3ZjZiOTY0NzI2">“Mmm! I’d like to meet them!”</p>
<p class="cnM0NTg1YWYyNGRmNTQ5Mzk5ODFkYTUyNTkxNDJhZjhl">“About that…”</p>
<p class="cnMyZGQ3ZmRkMTJkNTQ0MjdiYjM0NmNiMjZiNWYyMmVi">“Mmm?”</p>
<p class="cnM4MTBiMTdlMWMzMjQ4ZjhiMzIwYTJmOGQxNmRiNWFi">“After we repair the ship, we’re sailing south to Shimashina, where my father is working. He wants to meet me… and you.” She finally turned her head to face Amelia, whose eyes had gone wide in surprise, and her mouth had fallen open.</p>
<p class="cnNiODViODdmMjVmZDRhYzJhNTcxMjg4MDQ3OGU4MTVk">“I can’t wait!” Exclaimed Amelia, a grin reappearing on her face. “I’m going to complain about you throwing me in a cell! Then you’ll be in trouble!”</p>
<p class="cnNiODE0YWU4NDk4ZDRkOWZhYjgzNjAxMTUwMzM0OWYy">“Ha! Idiot. He’s more likely than me to throw you into a cell. He might throw me in there as well, while he’s at it.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTkyMGQ0MzQyMzQ5Nzc4Yjg2YzMyNDQ2OGM0ZGJi">“But you’re a Speaker.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMjkwZjAxYzdlMTRjNzRhYTk5ODI2N2RlMTk2OTUz">“So’s he.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNGI0ODllYWM1YjQ3MzA5YjYxZTZjNDBkY2FmYWUy">“Ah,” Amelia wrinkled her nose, scratching it, “Well then, guess I’ll have to make an excellent impression! Soon all your family will want their own human maid too!”</p>
<p class="cnNlMWU1M2M4YmFjZDQyMGQ4NGY1MTVmZWMzNGQ1OTcw">“Seven hells! I hope not. One of you in the family is enough.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYmIxZTE3ZGYzODQ1Yjc4OGY2ZTFjODMzM2E2OWIx">“Me, in the family?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNzNlMGRmOTY4YzQ0ZDk5YWVjODQzYjU2ZWRmZjgw">“Tsk! You know what I mean!”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDZkYjQzNmZhZDQ5ZGY5YTE4ZDlkNmY0ZjcxZGU3">“Just kidding!” Amelia rolled onto her back, scratching her belly. “I’m hungry! You want to get some food?”</p>
<p class="cnM5OTczZmFkMTMwMjRjYmNhZWQ3ZDNkODg3YmRjNGIx">“What have you been eating?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNDAyNTNkYzNmMjQ1ODNhZmI0MWFjNGUyYTU2YWM2">“Hillbrand started bringing me soups and omelets… they were alright I guess. Your bread sucks though. So hard!”</p>
<p class="cnM2MDdjODdlNWVjMjQzZTE4ZTFhYmI3ZDVhYzI0M2Qy">“... Let’s head to the kitchens, and see what the chefs can do for us. I could eat some meat. Dagon better have got some from the fleet.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGZiNjc5MDg4MTQwY2VhYWNiYjJlYzhlMWQwNzhi">They climbed out of their hammocks and left the room. As they did, Anathor piped up.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTliN2RmZDgxOTQ2ZDU4NzcyYTQwNzZjMTZkYzhm">“Captain, Dagon incoming! Looks like good news…”</p>
<p class="cnNlMGRjNTBkNDA3MzQwN2I5YzE0ZjEyYjNmNGEyNDk1">A moment later a frantic knocking sounded. “Come in,” she said. The door burst open and a somewhat excited and out of breath Dagon appeared.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzgyZDBiMjJkNzQ0M2Q5OTRhOWE1ZmU2OWFmODlk">“Captain! Schools of Sardis sighted!”</p>
<p class="cnNmMDE4N2U4Y2IwYjQ4MThhYmNkNzEzYjE0NGFjNGM3">“Where!?”</p>
<p class="cnM4Yjg5YWI1MDllZDQ1YjRhYmMzZDdmYjA5YWNjNDY0">“Two klicks bearing eighty degrees! About a kilometer below us! Got eyes on them!”</p>
<p class="cnNlNmI3MmQwOTI2ZTRhMzdhNjMwMTZhZGY0NGRjNTU5">“Anathor! Tell the helmsman to fix to a bearing of eighty degrees! Don’t let the observers lose track of them!”</p>
<p class="cnM5YzM1ZTA2MTdjYjRiYmFhZWJmZTE2NjZhNTM1Mjhi">“Aye, Captain,” the moose responded.</p>
<p class="cnMwZTA2ZWU4NTNiZDQ1ZWE4ZmJiNjk5OGE5MTQ3MTA5">“Dagon! We have nets?”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDQwYjQ1ZGI4ODQ4NjFhODhjODViMzkwYmY4NTg4">“Got enough for two of the fighters! I, uh, gave permission for them to start setting up already. Figured you would go for them!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNTI2Nzk5MDdlNDQ5OTRiZDUyZDJjM2FlODAwYTU1">“Good work. Head back to the bridge. Make sure the ship doesn’t get closer than a klick, don’t want to scare them off.”</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2MyMjM0ZmU2YjQxZWI4ODYyZWFiZWQwZmEwMTBm">“Aye, Captain!” Dagon saluted and disappeared. Serena glanced at Amelia to see her looking at her with a confused expression.</p>
<p class="cnM4NGMxMzllMTc3YzQyYmE4Y2Q4N2EyMzNlYTBkYjI1">“What’s that about?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MmM2MWVlMmFhYjQzMmY5NjJmOTIxNDgxOWU3MDhi">“You said you’re hungry?” Amelia nodded. “Well instead of hardtack and boiled vegetables, why not go fishing? Come now, quickly.” Serena set off, striding as fast as possible without running, Amelia struggling to catch up.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDczYTM3YWVkZTQxZWI4NjZlMmM3ODZhZGY5NjQ5">“Sardis,” she explained, “are a delicacy. They are fish that are rarely seen due to them being mostly transparent. They are also fast, which makes them hard to catch. The biggest problem is they have an organ that can detect the aetheric combustion of vessels, meaning you can’t get much closer than a klick before they scatter.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZDM5NTE0ZTZmZDQ1Y2FiMjlkZjRmNTdkMTIwNGM1">“How do you catch them?”</p>
<p class="cnMwZjAxMjFhODE0ZTQ5MGViYzZhZjVkN2Y3MjYzZDZh">“Normally you would use a dedicated fishing ship, but we’ll make do with fighters and nets. We’ll launch the fighters at a distance, far above the Sardis, and they’ll dive down with their engines off, catch them in the nets.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YTMxNmQ1ZGNmYjQyMmVhNTNlZGQ4MzI3YTk3ZGRh">“Are they… tasty?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNTBlMzU5Mjg3ZDRjNTk4MDg2NjlhMmVmNzY2M2Uy">“Seven hells! They are <em>delicious</em>, to both demons and humans. It’s rumored that their flesh is dense in aether, and can help promote growth for mages and warriors alike, although I suspect that’s a marketing tactic the fishing companies invented.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDFjMTRhOWY3YTRhZTY5OTEwZmZiYmM1ZDBjYmIw">They reached the first deck and instead of heading to the bridge Serena decided to go outside. She wanted to see them with her own eyes. The ship hummed as it began the almost full right turn.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzNhNGRlNmM5YTRhY2JhMDA1NGM0MzYxMWEzZmIx">“I’ve only had them a few times. The flesh goes bad quickly, and if you smoke and salt it, it ruins the taste. A good catch of Sardis can pay for an entire fishing vessel by itself if you can get it to market fast enough.” She kept her voice low, “If we can catch some, it’ll be the perfect thing to help with the ship's morale after the whole Korvus incident.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmZiNzdlNzhiMTRkZjNiMGMyZmMwNjQ2ZmIzMjll">“Understood! I’m excited!”</p>
<p class="cnM2NDQ2NDlkYTI3MDQ5NGJhY2ZjNTJiYzE1NDdlMTU5">On deck, the dozens of demons that had been relaxing, washing, and chatting were all pressed against the railings at the bow of the ship, pointing and gesturing. They made way for Serena and Amelia, one of the sailors passing her a spyglass.</p>
<p class="cnM1NTc4ODUxNDI1ODRiZWRhZWVhZGI2M2JmNWM1MTAw">“They’re flying above the cloud layer, just where it sticks up and out, near the cloud wall, Captain!” Said the demon. Serena peered through the spyglass, identifying the spot described to her. It took her a while, but then she saw them. Subtle shimmers against the backdrop of cloud and sky, gliding along in groups of a few dozen or more.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjYyYzIwYzhmOTRkOTU4NTIzNjlkNmQwOTEwM2Zi">“That’s more than I hoped! Anathor!” She called out. The ship's guardian would hear her. “Tell Dagon to launch the fighters as soon as they’re ready! Make sure they know what they’re doing!”</p>
<p class="cnNiYzQ5ZjQzODZlZTQwYmViZTZlYWFkYTNhZjFjYzg4">“I think… I see them! How are they so transparent!?” Amelia exclaimed, pointing down at the schools of Sardis. The woman had far better eyesight than normal.</p>
<p class="cnM4N2UwM2Q4YTAxZDQ4Zjg4NzkzMjdkNGY5NGMwMzVm">“It’s magical. They’re not intelligent, so it’s assumed they evolved the ability as a natural defense against birds of prey and other fish.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMjFjNWM4YzlhNzQ2YzA4NmY5NDg1YzU2NWM5ODIz">“That’s amazing!”</p>
<p class="cnNkYTViZGZkOTNiNzRkOTBiMmM3MjJiNjY3MWI5MmY2">A minute passed and a loud hum filled the air as two fighters detached from the ship and took to the skies, to the cheers of the demons. The fighters had attached triangular nets to their wings. Hopefully, it would be enough to catch even a few. The light craft rose high up, and Serena could see the pilots communicating with hand signals, coordinating their upcoming dive.</p>
<p class="cnNiY2VmOTljMTY2NzQ1ZDU5MzdkMjk1M2I0YWYxMTgy">“They’ll cut the engines in a moment, and then dive,” she explained to Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDAxM2MzZTZkZjQ5NjQ5MGQ3YTgxYzMxM2Q5ZDZh">“Hmm…” mumbled the human. “Do you want me… to help?” Her voice was quiet, only for her to hear.</p>
<p class="cnNjNDY4ZTUwNjI1ZTQ3NzY4MGE0MTMwMWE3ZjU1MDg2">“Help?” She whispered. “What do you mean, help?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZGU1Y2IyYThjYzQ2MDFhMjZjYjY1NjZiYTFkYjQ0">“I can feel them, I think. If I focus. I could try and dull their senses… with your permission?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNGRiNjc3M2QxOTQ0MDQ5YTE0NmZmOTI0MjA3NGI4">“You can do that?” Amelia nodded, her face a picture of serious confidence. “Can you do it… quietly?” She asked. Another nod.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjM2YmEwMDUyMjQ2NDk4MTBhMDM4Y2IyODhkYmU0">“Do it then.” The fighters had begun their dive, the steel hunters streaming down like arrows toward the Sardis. Amelia raised an arm, palm facing toward the fish, and closed her eyes. There was no burst of light, but Serena sensed a stream of aether erupting from the open palm and snaking out into the skies, beyond her perception.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjQ2NDQ5MjJkODQ5MmQ4MzVhOWYyZTNlMDQwZjY3">She frantically looked through the spyglass, taking painful seconds to find the Sardis again, and when she did her mouth opened in shock. They had somehow become opaque! Instead of being transparent, they were painted in hues of blue and green!</p>
<p class="cnNhN2QxMWI0MzI2NTQ4NGRhMGYyZTgwZTE1ZWQ5MTBk">“Here they come!” A voice rang out and the fighters, like birds of prey hunting in the night, flew in and through the groups of Sardis, before pulling up and closing their nets using their jury-rigged pulley system of ropes and weights. A tremendous noise of triumph and celebration erupted on deck, as it became obvious even from this distance that they had caught far more than a few.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjBlY2UxODg3NTQ4Y2VhYzJlMDUzNTEzMWVmZTg3">It was excellent flying from her pilots, she would be sure to give them a bonus for that and… she glanced to her side, at the blond woman, who slowly opened her eyes and returned the look, with a smug grin on her face.</p>
<p class="cnNjYjEwODYwYzUzODQ0NGViZjQ0MzAwMDY0NDZjMmYz">“I did good, didn’t I?” She asked, a mischievous twinkle in her blue eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTI3ZTUzNjg1MzRjYTliYTQ1YjM3MmY1NTQyMGE0">“You did good,” Serena said, and before a part of her mind could stop her, she reached out and ruffled the blond hair. It was like running her hands through fluffy silk. “Well done.” Before the moment became awkward she turned back to the Sardis, seeing the remainder had scattered into the clouds. The fighters began their turn back to the ship, their pilots throwing out fists of celebration.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTI3ZmZiYmJiZjQzYzQ5NTExZDFjZDgxOTQ1ZTBk">“We’re going to be eating good tonight!” She called out, the demons around her hollering. An idea sprung to mind. “You,” she said to Amelia, loud enough for those around the pair to hear. “What spell did you cast, to keep the Sardis from escaping?” Amelia paused momentarily, looking confused before widening her eyes slightly, as she then understood what Serena was doing.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2VkZGEzOWE2MzRmYzY4OGQzYjUxOWU4MzM3ZTkw">“Just a minor sleep spell! Just enough to make them drowsy! I didn’t want them falling out of the sky!” The many demons around them still chatted amongst themselves but were clearly eavesdropping on the conversation.</p>
<p class="cnMwOWE4ODMwODc4NjQwMWE4OWFjZTNlYWIwMDQyNGFl">“Excellent job. There are dozens of sailors on this ship who have never tasted Sardis before - and now will - thanks to you.” She noticed a number of demons nodding to themselves in her peripheral vision. Best not to let the opportunity go to waste.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTc1MTcwY2FkOTRhNzhiYTVkYWI4ZTExMDZmYWY4">“We have any of the cooks here!?” She called out.</p>
<p class="cnMxOGNiNDhkODVjNDQ3ZmI5MGZiNzk4OGYyZWUzMWZk">“Aye, captain!” One of the demons answered, wearing a white cap.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTA4NmRkYjZkYzQ3ZjNhZDM0ZTQyZWQ1YjAzYjdj">“Any of you know how to prepare Sardis?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NWM3NTJmZTA0MjQyYmQ4ZmY0ZDFmOGI3YmQzMWI4">“Haven’t done it before, but can’t be much different from Arkis.”</p>
<p class="cnMzOGNmOWU0MjlmYTQ3NDBhMDgyMWE1NDJmOWQ3MDY3">“Reckon you can take this one with you?” She reached a hand behind Amelia, pushing her forward.</p>
<p class="cnM1NTNjMDJjM2NhODRiNzU4MzMxZDQ1YjQwZDIzNWY5">“Me!?” Exclaimed the human.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTY4MTczNTkwZjRmZWE4MzEwYWU3ZmU3MjY0MGJh">“You are my <em>maid</em>, and you did say you wanted to learn how to cook, didn’t you? That alright with you, and your boys?” She asked the latter question to the cook, who rubbed his chin.</p>
<p class="cnMwZmE2YmQ1YmI0NjRhODNhYmI0MWYzZWUyM2ZhMDgy">“Aye, that’ll be alright with us. Come on then, Miss Thornheart.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMmU3OTBlYjliODQ2NTI5ZmRhMDU2ZDBlOWM2ZTIy">“... Okay!” Amelia bounced up. “I’ll make sure to prepare your dish, Lady Halen!”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTMzNDY3NGY2ZDQxOWVhM2YwYTA4ZDJkY2E0YTg0">“Captain,” intoned the cook, and led Amelia down the deck, as the fighters made the last maneuvers before docking back up with the ship.</p>
<p class="cnM1OGU3MzA4OTk1ZTQ4Mjc5NjlhOGMwYTcxNjZjYWI4">“Wait…” a voice sounded out. Amelia had stopped, her attention to the skies off starboard. Slowly, she raised a finger, pointing at something. “There’s something there. In that cloud.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNWVlODM5MjRiODRhNTk5YjkzYjZjMGQwMTgzYTY4">Serena followed the finger to see it pointing to a huge wall of the cumulonimbus cloud wall, reaching from upper-sky all the way down to low-sky. She walked up alongside Amelia, eyes trying to spot something within the mountain of white. She strained her senses, but a warrior's sensitivity was always less than a mage's.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjIzYWJlNWMzNzQzZjQ4NWEwNmVjZWUxZDY2Y2M2">“What is it? What can you sense?”</p>
<p class="cnM4YTk5MjY3OTBiYzRmYjlhY2M2NTA2YTJlY2VhNDgz">“It’s like… a heartbeat. It’s big… I think it’s coming closer!”</p>
<p class="cnM2YTdjMDQ0MDdmMTRkZTE4NWQzYTY1YWQ1NTU0YmRl">Serena was just about to give the command for battle stations, when another voice beat her to it. It was Dagon, shouting from one of the bridge doors.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDAyZDUyYWY3OTQxYWZhNjAyZWU3YWM5Y2IyYzA0">“Captain! Arcwhale! Starboard!”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDkzMWFmZWVlODRlNjk4ZjI5ZjRiYWJlMGQ4YTgz">With that, a deep bellow sounded in the sky. A noise somewhere between the echoing roar of distant thunder and the drone of a wind-blown organ. It was a majestic and ethereal sound that resonated through the clouds. A dark shadow appeared on the surface of the cloud wall, and then the arcwhale breached through with another mournful cry.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzNiODI0NjVkNDQwN2I4MmY0NzJkNWQ0OWYwN2Iy">It was enormous. Larger than a battleship. It was nearly three hundred meters long, and a hulking body, painted with stripes of purple and blue, took up most of its mass while two tails - extruding from the rear - took up the other two-thirds of its length.</p>
<p class="cnMwZThkNTJlNTg5ZjRjYzY5ZDFlMjk3YjUxNWRlNjhi">It was flying in parallel with the <em>Vengeance</em>, one of its huge fins still embedded in the cloud wall, splitting it like a knife through paper.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODM1NDEyYTYwNDQ3YjA4OGEyMDJlZGYyMjkyODNl">“Don’t point any weapons at it!” She shouted down to Dagon. “It’s just curious! Prepare to dive if we need to!” The arcwhale was pulling up alongside the ship, its enormous eye staring at them.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTRkNGE4ODRiYTQxNDlhNjI5YjNiNWRjZGUzYjFi">“Don’t cast any magic,” she quickly said to Amelia. “It might think it’s an attack.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NDQ0YmM3NTg0NDQwNzViYjdiMDQ1ZDExMjE3OGU1">“That’s… a big fish,” said Amelia, slowly raising a hand and waving at the enormous creature. “Hello,” she whispered. “Nice to meet you…”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDFiNTc3M2EyZDQ4MGM4MWEyZDhiZGQxYWM3YTU1">“It’s Rhaknam!” A panicked voice cried out.</p>
<p class="cnM1MmM0M2RiOTRjMzQwMzU4MWZmMDhiZTFiOTJmNTM4">“No!” Shouted Serena. “Rhaknam lives in the Shattered Isles! Rhaknam is darker!”</p>
<p class="cnNkODQ1ZDMwMzIzNjQ1Y2ZiNWEwODYwMzUxMGE2ZTBl"><em>And much bigger,</em> she thought to herself.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjZmODY5ZWE4MjQwYTI4Nzc5NzM1MWNhZDdjYjBm">“It’s just curious about the ship!” She yelled, reassuring herself as much as the crew. “Don’t do anything stupid! Don’t run! Let it satisfy its curiosity! It might have thought our lift engine was one of its brethren!”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWNjNzExOGU0YTQyNjJhOGM4NTEyMWY4YTRlODEy">She placed a hand on Amelia’s shoulder, who was still staring wide-eyed at the arcwhale, which seemed - if she wasn’t mistaken - to be looking right back at her. “You okay?” she asked.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjlmM2E1ZjNlYzQ0ODlhYWJiYWY4NzkyOTJkNDU5">“Who… who’s Rhaknam?” Amelia questioned, not taking her eyes away from the titanic animal.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGJhZGZmZjM0ODQ5M2M4OTQwMGM3MjA3ZGY2ZWEz">“Rhaknam is their god, the god of arcwhales. They follow him and Speak his name when attacked. Of course, if you try and hunt one and succeed, Rhaknam himself would come up from the Shattered Isles and… cause problems.” She gritted her teeth. She had heard stories. Tales from centuries ago. Nations wiped from the map.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzM5YTMwNjg2ODRhOWJhODk2ODE0NWI0ZDI0NWZi">“Wait, they can Speak!?” Amelia exclaimed.</p>
<p class="cnNlMDlmMWQ0MTM4NDQ3NTk4MzIxNWE1NTMyNGI3NTVi">“Yes, at least, big ones like this one here can. <em>Rhaknam</em> being their First Word.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDlmN2RiZDlkYTRhOGFiODE1Yzk3MWRjNDBjMWU0">“I didn’t know there were animal gods! I only thought there were demon and human ones!”</p>
<p class="cnM2NzZlYWM5YzJlNTQ4YTViNmI0OGRlYjQ4ZGJhZDUx">“Rhaknam isn’t the only animal god in the sky. There are others - some are known - others are just myths. I’ll go over this with you, or have Tomes do it. There’s a lot you don’t know.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOWUzOWU2NDQ5ZjRhOWZiZGMwODUwMmI1MzYxMWQy">“How does it stay up!?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWY1ZmMxNWVlMTQ0ZjQ4MGUwYTBmMzgzMWY3MGMz">“Remember the heartbeat you felt? It has organs that do something similar to our lift engine, only it does it with flesh rather than steel.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MjM5MmU1YzgzOTRlNDk5N2E1NzlkMDhmZGMzY2Rk">“That’s incredible! Hello, Mr Arcwhale!” She waved again.</p>
<p class="cnM5Mjc3NjBiNTI3NDQzZDE5MzViZTMzZTNhOGFhMDU4">“Stop waving. It’ll go away soon.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZTYzYmY1YzYxOTQ1MWI4ZWVjN2Y1MWMyYjdkMDk4">“It won’t attack us, will it?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZmVmNGU3MjUwZDRiY2JiNTA1MjhhNjY4NTg5MDkz">“No, not unless we attack it first. A deal was struck - a long time ago - between Rhaknam and the Empress. We share the skies, ignoring each other as best we can but…” she gestured at the gigantic animal, “Sometimes one of them gets curious, or mistakes a ship for another of its kind.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MzVhOTllN2Y3YTRiNDY4YmM5MDgwNTNiMGExNzFk">Another bellow sounded out from the arcwhale, a melody that lingered long in the ears of everyone who heard it. Then, rolling slowly like a great ship, it moved away from the <em>Vengeance</em> until it was swallowed back up in the clouds. They watched the shadow of its presence fade until only the white wall of cloud remained.</p>
<p class="cnNjZWRiMTgzZDlhMzRjN2NiNTg4Y2FiMjljNGNiYTA0">“Maybe it was after the same Sardis as we were, and got annoyed?” Amelia questioned.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDQ5YWY3MjY3MzQ4NmE4OTg2ZDVjOTc0OGIwMzhk">“Maybe. Let’s go. You, head to the kitchens. I have a report I need to write. Every sighting needs to be added to the records, and besides…” she eyed Amelia, “Who knows what else is going to appear if you stay outside.”</p>

<p class="cnM2ZDFmMWEwNTQ4NDQxYzA5NWYzYjAyYjJjZGQ2YWZi"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM3MzYwOWM5ZDc4ZTRkZmQ4YzFlM2U0YmUwYmY2NTFj">“One at a time, you bloody demons! You’re like a pack of damn wolfhounds! One at a time!”</p>
<p class="cnNkMTRmYTNmZGQzYjQ5OGQ4NGVkMTcyNmNkM2Q1NTM4">The rabble slightly calmed down at the head cook’s bellowing, but it took only moments for it to fall back into a frenzy again, encouraged by the exclamations of the demons who managed to get their meal.</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2I3MzMwYjA4YzRlYTBhZGI3YzRhNTUwNjdkMmEy">“Seven hells! How can something taste so good!?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWE0YTY4NTU0ODQxZjg5MTAxZTI3NjVjZjkxMTc0">“I must have died! I definitely died!”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjM0Y2Q4MTBiODRlZjk4MGE4YmNkMmI4YjA4MDYw">“I feel like a right proper noble eating this, ha!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNTk2N2E2MzY0ODQ3MzU4MDg0MmRkNjhlNTNiZGQ4">“Me next! Me! I was first!”</p>
<p class="cnNlZjEzOGQ0MTdlMjRlMDk4MzA5ZTk5NGEyM2ZlMDc2">The sardis was being filleted and cooked as quickly as possible. The sound of its sizzling flesh as it was placed on the hot plate was tantalizing. A rich mouth-watering aroma filled the air and contributed to the chaos of impatient hungry demons.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmM2YjBmZDkyZjRiODE5YTFiOWIwMjNjNjk3Mzky">“Miss Thornheart! Gut these two!”</p>
<p class="cnNiMzlmZmVmMWIxYjQwMTU4YTU1MTFlY2MzMTNiODk4">“Yes, Head Cook!” Amelia hurried to the part of the kitchen that had been designated as the gutting station. She used a sharp knife to make an incision from the sardis’s tail to its gills, being careful not to cut too deep and penetrate the internal organs. They had been impressed by her knife control and quick learning, something that was certainly aided greatly by her high dexterity stat from the game.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzNiNjA3ZDVkYjQxZmM4ZjEwZGUyNjkxZDA1NzM2">With the sardis’s belly open, she gritted her teeth and reached into the abdominal cavity, pulling out the innards. She couldn’t deny it made her squeamish, but the knowledge and sounds of a hundred ravenous demons behind her put those thoughts to rest. With the internal organs removed, she ran a thumb - like she had been shown - along the spine of the fish, removing any dark kidney tissue that would ruin the flavor.</p>
<p class="cnNjM2UwMDkwMWYzMjQwMGI4OGY2NmQ2ZjRjOGI1ZDFh">They had gone through a sardis and a half before they figured that out.</p>
<p class="cnNhOTY4Yjk2ZTYzYTQ1ODY5ZWJjODU4YTMwOGM4ZDQ4">Finally, she rinsed the insides of the fish and once that was done, repeated her actions with the remaining sardis. The results were passed to the next cook in line, who was delicately cutting through the connective tissue around the gills to detach the head.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzNiMGM0OTUyMDQ3OTFiMDAxYjRjZTZhYTVlMzZl">“Done, Head Cook!”</p>
<p class="cnMzNDE4MTBiZjU3NDQ3Yjk4OWVmOGZmMGVhMDU2OGI1">“Get over there! I need more cooked! Don’t let the rest burn!”</p>
<p class="cnMzNjI4OWRhZGM5NTQ3YzY4YzlkMWUzNjRkOTdhYWVh">“Y-yes!”</p>
<p class="cnNlZWQzMjEzYzcxMTRkZTk4NWY4ODM3OTg4NTAxYmVh">“Yes what!?”</p>
<p class="cnMzODQ1NjQyZGEyZDQzY2U5ZWFjZWE3ODExYmU0ZjQ2">“Yes, Head Cook!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNTViMTMwZmI0MzRkYmE5NjIyZjI5NjMzNWUxN2Rh">She ran to the hot plate where fillets of Sardis were cooking. Amelia breathed through her mouth, not daring to breathe through her nose lest she start drooling all over the food! She grabbed a pair of metal tongs and began turning the fillets that needed it and removed the others that had just reached a subtle golden colour. Amelia wasn’t sure if the flesh of fish was supposed to become golden when cooked, but sardis did.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjdmYTAwMzNlMTQ5MzE5YzY2YzI0ZjJkMjIxM2Q4">She replaced the empty spaces on the hot plate with new fillets that made a satisfying sizzling sound as they contacted the metal. The cooked fillets were carried over to the opening where the head cook was defending against the horde.</p>
<p class="cnMxODgxMTFlY2JmOTQ5N2RiMzVlYTk2Njc0MThhODc1">“Head Cook! We’re falling behind over here!” One of the cooks shouted.</p>
<p class="cnMzMzhjNDRhZDAwODRmMmNhODc5ODgyYzkzODk3NTZh">“Miss Thornheart!” The head cook peered down at her, raising two fingers. “Two pieces per demon! Two pieces per plate! No favoritism!” He dragged her to his spot in front of the crowd. “Go easy on her or she won’t heal any of you animals in the future!”</p>
<p class="cnNhYjZlZTBhODkwYzQzZGRiNjliZjY2NTE1YTlmMzll">Amelia gulped and the head cook vanished deeper into the kitchen, leaving her at the mercy of the frantic mob!</p>
<p class="cnMzNzE5NjhlM2U0MTQ5MWRiYjNkZjQxYjdlNjBhMGVl">“O-one at a time! Hey! Hands off!” She swatted the hand of a demon reaching over the counter.</p>
<p class="cnM0NjgwY2YyYzAzYzRmNTliOWM2MzM3ZDhmZTA0MDkz">“Hurry up!”</p>
<p class="cnM1N2NkY2VkNWM3ZTQ3ZjZiMDc5ZTg4Mjk1ZDY5OGNi">“We’re hungry over here, Miss!”</p>
<p class="cnMzZmY1NzMxYWE0MDRjNmVhMmJkMjhlMDMyOWM1N2Yz">“I’ll pay you if you give me an extra piece!”</p>
<p class="cnMxNjgyNDgxZTJlYTQ3NDJhN2QzYzQ4OTY2NDlmNjdh">Amelia found her stride and began serving the demons. She wasn’t sure but thought that perhaps they were slightly less aggressive with her than with the head cook. That didn’t stop the mess hall from being a madhouse though. Two pieces per demon. Two pieces per plate. She absorbed herself in the task.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzc3NTI4ODYxMjQxMjhhNThlZDg5MjhkN2U1MmYx">“Don’t stand around eating, you idiots! Get your grub and get out of here!” Tomes' voice could be heard from somewhere. The mess hall was a long, thin part of the ship and could only hold so many sailors at once. They were being funneled out the moment they got their food, to the outside corridors, first deck, or their quarters where they could enjoy the sardis.</p>
<p class="cnM2N2ViODQ3OWU0ZTQyZTVhOTQzZjZiNGJiZGQ4N2E3">“Two pieces per demon! Two pieces per plate!” She repeated to herself, a mantra to keep order in the chaos. After a while, she realized the noise had died down, and coming out of her work trance she couldn’t help breaking out into a nervous smile.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzBlN2ZiODM5MjQ5ODk5YmQ0MWE4NDM1Y2VhNWFm">“Working hard?” Serena intoned, a space forming around her that she naturally commanded.</p>
<p class="cnNkZWQ1MzEzMmZkZjQyMGE5MWNhZmFkZWY4MmIyMDBl">“Y-yeah!” Amelia looked at the demon, noting the small smile that had appeared on Serena’s face. Honestly! Even though it was nice that she wasn’t snarling at her anymore - with that look in her eye that said <em>I really want to stab you right now</em> -she kind of missed it… Maybe she should annoy her in the future, see what happened when she pushed the captain’s buttons.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDA1ZDE4N2IxNjQzMmZhZTFiODhlMTUxZWJiNjk0">“I’m waiting…”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmViN2M0ZmJhYTQ3NTdhNjhmNTA0YmFiZWE3NDll">“Ah! Sorry!” Amelia hurried and placed two pieces of golden fish on a plate. “Two pieces!” She said, beaming at Serena. “Per plate! No favoritism!” She handed the food to the captain, who cast a wary eye at it, then at her, and then at the pile of cooked sardis. Then, reaching out an arm, slowly and steadily, like a snake after its prey, the captain took another piece!</p>
<p class="cnNlYTJhOGYyNjgwOTQ0MDJiZjY4YWFhODk1YjA1YzVi">“Three!?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjM1OGI5YTZhYzRiZmVhOTUxYmZiNDU2NzdmNTZh">“Officers get another share,” Serena said, standing straight and dignified before reaching out and…</p>
<p class="cnNiMDMzYThhZWExMTRjMmZiYmMyNDVmYmI2ZjM5NGZi">“Four!?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTVhYWI3MGNiOTQ2ZWVhMjA4NTkyMTc3NDhlOTQ0">“Hmm? Oh, didn’t you know? Captain gets one more,” she gave an exaggerated sigh, “Especially as she’s been under <em>so much stress</em> recently.” With a definite smug grin on her face, rivaling that of Amelia’s own…</p>
<p class="cnNiZjIxOGVlMDRkMDQ2ODliMGVmYjE4NmRjOTI1M2Qw">“<em>Five!?”</em></p>
<p class="cnMyMzAwYWZjMWQ2MzQ3ZDg4MGI3MzliY2Q1NjA0YmY4">She shouldn’t chastise her captain, but she couldn’t help puffing out her cheeks in frustration! “Why five!? That’s unfair!”</p>
<p class="cnMxNDU0NTA0Zjg5NDRmOTZiZGIwYzllOTU3M2MyMGY2">“Well, an extra one for every Word you can Speak,” Serena leaned in, eyes glinted mischievously, “And how many will you be taking, I wonder?”</p>
<p class="cnMyZWZmNjg3NzQ1MzQ5YzdiMTJkNzg0OWZmYWNkNTFh">She… she was playing with her! It wasn’t a serious attempt at extracting information from her, she was sure of that! Amelia bit her lips, trying to think of a good comeback but finding nothing came to mind. Blast it! She knew it would come to her when she would drift off to sleep tonight, too late!</p>
<p class="cnM5ODI2YzQxMTlhNTQ5ZmM5NDhjNjI2NzlmOWMxYzM2">“Cooks!” Serena called out, her voice taking on that commanding captain’s edge. The demons in the kitchen stopped what they were doing immediately. “An extra piece for you all, for your work! I last had sardis when I graduated and that was cooked by Hakian chefs from the desert! I’m telling you I think you may have outdone them!” The cooks raised their fists, hollering.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjdlNjE0ODhmMjRmZTI5ZjcyNDc4ODI1MTVmMzgw">“Aye, Captain!”</p>
<p class="cnMxMjljNzQ2NjhjOTQ3MWNiODg3MWQ1MTMxMzc3MTQ4">“Give another share to the pilots, any remaining pieces we’ll cut in half and serve for tomorrow's breakfast. If there’s not enough, we’ll do it by roulette.” Commands given, Serena looked at Amelia. “As for <em>you</em>. Once you’re finished with your work here, come to my quarters.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjY1NWZiNzE4NjQ0Zjc5YjdlYWQ1NjNmYTVlMTky">“Yes, Captain! I mean Lady Halen!” With that, Serena turned and - exuding control and dignity - left the mess hall. All was quiet for a few seconds before the chaos picked up once again as the last few dozen demons scrambled to be first in line.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTM4Y2UwZjIxYjQ4MjI4OTY2N2U1MmRkZTVhZjY5">Amelia worked hard, and before she knew it she had been lost in her task and there was no one else left to serve. Looking around, the last of the sardis had been prepared and stored for tomorrow.</p>
<p class="cnM2NjM1NzQzYWJjMzQwM2M4ZjFlOGVlYjdiZjdmMzgz">“Phew!” She said to herself, taking a plate and putting one, two, and then a third piece of sardis on it. It was common knowledge now she was a Speaker so she didn’t feel concerned about that third piece.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDAzMWEyMzhmNDQ4YmVhMzQyYjEwODNkODc2N2Yy">Besides, if she truly followed Serena’s instructions, she wasn’t sure if there were enough fillets, or space on her plate!</p>
<p class="cnM1ODE0ZDA5MzIzMTQ3ZTY5ODk3ODdiZTAxN2Q0Mjhh">Her mouth had started watering again in anticipation! “Thank you! It was fun learning how to prepare fish! I’m happy to help in the future!” She gave a polite bow to the group of cooks.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTEwNDNkMDllNDQzZDhiMDU4YzYzYjZkNmE4YjZl">“Miss Thornheart!” Bellowed the head cook, folding his arms and looking at her sternly, “Where do you think you’re going!?”</p>
<p class="cnMyZjYyYjZlZWFiZTQzMDlhODIxOTcwMTA5ZGRhYzYy">“Y-yes, Head Cook! Umm… to eat?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NGNmM2VmMDc0MDQ1YTViM2Q3M2I5ODUzZTg1YjYx">The demons stared at her for a moment and then started chuckling amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjIwOTRmOWZmOTRjYjQ4ZDc4ODA4YWU4ZDlkZWNj">“The captain instructed you to come to her quarters after your work is done, is that right?”</p>
<p class="cnNhOGQyNTk5ZDc0NDQyYTc4NjViYjJmYWQyOWE4YTFh">“... yes, Head Cook!”</p>
<p class="cnM0YTcwMGM4MWIwNTRiZDk4ZTNkY2JiZmRjZGJiYjVl">“And <em>that!”</em> The head cook pointed to the workspaces of the kitchen covered in the blood and guts of fish. “And, <em>that!”</em> he gestured to the sinks, where a mountain of unwashed plates was piled up. “What do you think that is, Miss Thornheart?”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjBkMjMyNTE5MTQzNWNiZDk4MjExMTQ1NDE5Zjdm">Amelia felt her shoulders drop.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzcyYjI3MTNhMDQyNTc5ZDUwYTk5N2EwMDQ4ZmJj">“... more work, Head Cook…”</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2UzMDg3Y2I3ZjQxMWE5NzBjOTgxYmJhNGM0OTA5">She put her plate of heaven to the side. Fighting back tears she grabbed the washing-up cloth and began filling the sink.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDljN2VmOTQ5MDQ4OTc5ZTM4MzVmNDhiZmIxYzZk">Over the next two hours, she would curse more than a few times.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmIwNDc0M2VlZjQ0NGY5M2UzNzE3ZDhmMGNkYjJh"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NzQ0NjFkZWEyMDQ0MjFhYmVhZWRjZmNlOTJjNzAz"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM0NWRlODdhMTE1MzRiYjlhNGVmMjQ3YTg1YTYwNWQ3">With her hair and clothes wet, with bits of foam lingering here and there, Amelia opened the door to the captain's quarters.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODJmMmJlYjU3ODQzMDJiYmJkMzcyMzNmNzNjMjAx">“You should knock, in the future,” Serena said immediately, without taking her eyes off the paper she was writing on. Despite being mentally exhausted, seeing the captain reinvigorated her a little.</p>
<p class="cnMyZGJjZjhjYzEzNjRlYWM4NzZiMWU2YmIwZTBmYTIz">“Even though these are also my quarters? Anathor will let you know when I’m coming, won’t he?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NjMwNTM2ZGU2YzQ5ZGQ4ZDNmZmVkNDhmYWY4ZjRh">“Even though. Additionally-” Serena raised her eyes at Amelia, her speech stopping seeing the condition Amelia was in. The corner of her mouth crept up in a smile. “Oh dear, they had you washing up?”</p><span class="cmU0YmIxNGU4M2FkOTQ0NjRiM2UwN2U1NWY3MTBjODIy"><br/>This story is posted elsewhere by the author. Help them out by reading the authentic version.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM0YjYxNmJiY2YyYzRhMDRiYmExNzc4YTYyY2Q1ODE1">“I have <em>never</em>,” Amelia said, letting herself spawl onto the wooden floor, “done so much washing up in my life!” She let out a long groan. “Hundreds of plates. Hundreds! I want to cry…”</p>
<p class="cnNhZWM0ZmYzOTI2YzQ3M2Y4NWZlNWVhNjlmOTY5NmM0">“You finished it all though, yes? With minimal complaining?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NDhlMmM1NmMxZTQ1YjM5MjdmNTU1MTE3ZmNhMDc3">“... yeah.”</p>
<p class="cnNjM2VkZTk1MDUzNzQzMGNiMWI1ODYyODJmZjM4NTE0">“Then I imagine you passed.”</p>
<p class="cnNiM2ZjZGM2MTRiZjQzZTU5ODA4NGJkYWZlYjBmMWZj">“Passed?” Amelia raised a weary head from the floor to see Serena looking down at her with amusement.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjAyNDUyZTAwZjRmOTZhODVjOTJhNjkxZjU1YmUw">“All new cooks get washing up duty first. It’s the rite of passage. Anathor told me the head cook complimented your work ethic after you left.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjY4NzU4NTE1ODRlMzNhYjkxOGIzMTA4NDU5ZWQz">“Really!? That’s great!” Amelia sat up, “Maybe I’ll try and invent a dishwasher…”</p>
<p class="cnNhODMzOWVhNDU1ZTQ5YzhiN2E2YTk3ZTg0NjYzZmFh">“Dishwasher? As in… the job title?”</p>
<p class="cnNhODQ3MDJmY2YwMzQyNDBiNmZlNTBkNDRmZGNmYjcz">“Nah, like the machine. We had them. You put all the dirty dishes in and then press a button and it would clean <em>and</em> dry them all for you!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NTMwYzcyZjYxNDQwYzQ5NWRkMzIyNGUwZGJiMDgy">Serena raised an eyebrow, looking interested. “Oh? I thought you said you didn’t have aether? How does it work? Just steam-powered?”</p>
<p class="cnNmZDgxOTE2YThiYjRkMGRhODM2YjNhN2ExNmE4YzMw">“No, it all runs on electricity.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NzM0ZmUyOTlmNDQ5ZjU5ODIzYjE1YmU0OTZjNWNi">“<em>Electricity</em>? Really?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNWQ3OWEyMjZkNDQ5NTJiYjk3ZjA2OTUxOTEwYzAx">Amelia nodded, “Yeah! Like the lights on the ship.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjdjMWZkNDlmMjRiODg4YTg0ODI4ODQ2M2VjYTNi">“The lights on the ship run on aetheric principles, not electricity.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNWMzYTVmYmNlYjQ1NjliZGY2NWRmYzdkZGI2ODBj">“What!?” Amelia jumped up, examining the lights in the room. It was as Serena said, these lights, despite looking and being shaped like electric ones from her world, were completely different on the inside. There appeared to be some kind of shining crystal inside. “What’s the crystal?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWViYzM2YzdhZDRkMzc5OTdlNjBjNjQzNjVkMjg4">“Moon crystal. They interact with aether in interesting ways in different circumstances. It’s what allows the lift engine to function in the first place. I suppose you didn’t have crystals in your world, or anything similar?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YzExNzA1YzYzYzQ1MWJiMTgyZmYzZjU1ZGJlZDFk">“No! It was all electricity! Do you run anything on electricity?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjI5NmIyMTIyOTRmN2NhYzNmODkzYjVmNjQyZWUy">“How would you even create light from electricity?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDM0MTZiOGEyODRhMzNiZDU4MDc1MmNjZDYwNTRi">“Uh, you run electricity through a thin piece of metal, I think it has to be a special kind, and put it in clear glass surrounded by a special gas… I think?” Amelia shrugged, she had never had to think about something as common as a light before.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzg0OThhYjJhODQ0ODI4MGUyZjUyZjUwNzRkOTlh">“I don’t think that would work here. Too much electricity causes interference with the aetherfield and vice-versa. An electrical light would probably blow out whenever there was a lumina storm in the vicinity.”</p>
<p class="cnM0YTVhZjNjZTJjZTRmMTM5Y2I1OTExNmQ2N2ExZjEz">“That makes… so much sense! How long do these… aetherlights last?”</p>
<p class="cnM3Njk3YzY0YWQ4YjQwYWQ4ZmZlYjk5NGJjODJjMzQw">“As long as the crystal remains undamaged…” Serena turned her eyes upwards, thinking, “... Forever I suppose.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMWU3NDg5MjFjNzQ4ZTFiYzZjZmNkOTI5NGRhOGI0">“<em>Forever!?</em>”</p>
<p class="cnNlYzZmZDRjNmU3YzQ3MzVhYjNlY2ZhYzNmNGRhMDc5">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMzE5ZTdkZTg0MDQ0YzliMDAyZTliYTg4YTZlNmY1">“Ha! You have no idea how incredible that is! A never-ending source of light! People back home would shower you with prizes for discovering that!”</p>
<p class="cnNmOTczMjdmNzkxZDQ4NDJhMDYzYzgwMDU2MGJiMGRi">“Well, it’s nice to finally have something about <em>my</em> world shock <em>you</em>. How refreshing.” Serena gestured for her to approach. “Look here.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZjdjOGMyMWUxYjQ5YmVhZmYwMGNhMGY3ZDlhMDVh">Amelia bent down and examined it. It was a table with many columns and three rows. The headers of the columns were written in what she now knew as Imperial, even if she still couldn’t read it. The text in the rows was the script Serena had shown her previously, the phonetic language of the Words.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGNlNTQxYmM4YTQ4YTZhY2Y0YWQyMjE1Y2U3MmZi">“This,” Serena said, “Is a somewhat updated table of all the known human Words. Centralis Intelligence might know more, and the human nations themselves will be keeping some hidden, but this is most of what we know.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZWE1YmNhMDU3NDQyNDE5ZGM3ZTBkMTRmYmUzM2Fk">Amelia peered down, there were twelve columns and for each one, the first row was entirely filled, the second row only a handful, and for the third row a single solitary entry.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzgyYWYwYTFlNTQ1ZWJiNzViYjdlZmQzZGRlZDM4">“Since you can’t read this yet,” Serena said, “I will sound them out for you. As the Dragon and I both suspect - and you’ve hinted at - you may or may not be a dual-speaker, if not more. I’ll skip over the bit where I explain how incredibly impossible that is and put it down to the fell gods playing a joke on me. Instead, I’ll read these out.”</p>
<p class="cnM2M2EyOWE4NjFmZDRiNWU5ZmQ3Y2Q3OWU0OWM4YmYy">Serena took a breath, and with a quick glance at Amelia, began reading out the Words.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDdkZmU2NDBmMjQ0YmU5Yjc5Y2NiMTRlMmI1YWUy">“<em>Agni, Gaia, Aeolus, Yemaya</em>. Those are the First Words - and names of gods - of the human branches of fire, earth, air, and water.” She looked at Amelia a moment and then continued. “<em>Besram, Surya, Rula, Aseco.</em> Those are for the branches of protection, light, healing, and divinity. Then we have the warrior Words. <em>Ares, Sullar, Luhran, Theran</em>. These are the branches of the sword, spear, bow, and shield.<em>”</em></p>
<p class="cnNjZGZhZTFlN2I0NjQ2NWNiMzIyYmE5NzFjZmE0ZTFm">“Okay…” Amelia said. Other than <em>Aseco</em>, she didn’t know any of these Words personally, although many of the names were familiar to her from the game. “What about the second row?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNTM3ZDYzNmQyZDRmOWI5ZmVkMWRhZWE4NTE1NDMy">“The second row is for the known Second Words of each branch. Considering how insanely <em>rare</em>,” a flash of a glance in her direction, “it is for anyone, human or demon to know a Second Word, we know very few of them. It is not knowledge that is given out easily.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YmJjNTRhN2MwYzQ3MzVhOWE1YWEzOWY0ZGUyMjJl">Serena pointed to a few entries. “We know of <em>Vulcan</em>, the Second Word of the fire branch, Spoken after <em>Agni</em>. We know of <em>Alorium</em> the Second Word after <em>Aeolus</em>, the human wind god. For the warrior branches we only know the Second Word of the sword and bow, which are,” Serena traced the script with her finger, “<em>Kartikay</em> and <em>Apollo</em>. For the remaining branches, we only know the Second Word of divinity, <em>Asclepius</em>,” a momentary pause, “Spoken after <em>Aseco</em>, your Word. Any of these… ringing any bells?”</p>
<p class="cnMzOGY3NTE5MTg1YjQ4ZjFiMWY0ZTFmYWFmZTA5Yjk5">“... maybe.” She said, suddenly feeling the urge to look away. Could she Speak <em>Asclepius</em>? If she went by the game, she should be able to, but Amelia never had the opportunity while in battle with Korvus and Narean, where she had favored more familiar and powerful Words to subdue both him and the rampaging minor god. “What about the third row? There’s only one entry, under <em>Asclepius</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZTQ3NjIzNmQzNDRmNDA4NGRkYTcxZjdhMDE2ZDM5">“That… is the only known human Third Word, known only by the Pope, who has sat on his golden throne in the Vatican for centuries. It is <em>Ascemurella</em>, the highest god the humans have managed to commune with.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYTllNTk1YTU0NjQyM2Y4ZmU4ZjA0M2IxMzYyMzJl">“I see,” Amelia said, “And… are you expecting me to tell you any additional Words I know, if any?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjhkZDljZGU4MDQzN2RiZjg2YWY3Y2QwY2I2NWM4">“No. I just want to put it in context for this discussion about how rare Speakers are, and how closely their secrets are kept. Second Word Speakers are strategic weapons, closely guarded and controlled by both sides in past, current, and future conflicts.” Serena spread out a large sheet of paper, on this one was a map.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTk1ZDMzZjBlNDRkODU5MjI4OWRjNTcyNjFmMDA2">“This is <em>Cascadia</em>, both the name of the floating continent and the namesake of the empire of demonkind, the <em>Cascadian Empire</em>. It is split into five major administrative regions. In the center is <em>Centralis,</em> which is the economic hub of the Empire. Several dozen cities in the Centralis basin contain the majority of the Empire's population,” Serena gestured at the map, “And to the north, east, south, and west we have the four <em>Terra Firmas</em> which are each ruled by an <em>Overlord,</em> each of them being a powerful Second Speaker, as well as a triple or quad First Word Speaker.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNzgxODU1ZjJiYjRlNDliZjFhZjcwNTE3OTM3ZmY2">“And Centralis? Doesn’t the most important area have an Overlord?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OWE0NGY3Njc0YjQzYzQ5MGEzMzU4NTE4MDVkNDgw">“No, because Centralis is headed by the Empress of Demonkind, the divine <em>Elana</em>. She is immortal - a shard of infinity - and has lived for nearly a thousand years. Like the human pope, she is a Speaker of the Third Word. Demons consider her to be a god in demon form, and as you learn more about her you will come to understand why.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NTgzMjA2ZWRhNzQzMTliNmMwNDBkNDU3MTJhNWFi">“What’s her Third Word?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YzNhZDNmYTM1YjQyZjM5MTllZGM0Y2Y1ZjExODMy">“It is unknown. We only know that it is the Third Word of the branch of demonic hellfire.”</p>
<p class="cnNmN2UwMmRkZjE5YzQ3MzFiNTA1YmVmNGUxNzE0OGIz">“I see!” Amelia felt herself getting excited. Demon Words were her speciality!</p>
<p class="cnNkNTQxYTA1MjI3MDQwYjBhOTI4M2Q2MWY0OGU5ODU1">“Although, there are records and evidence of it being Spoken in the last millennium. The Shattered Isles here,” Serena pointed to an area of empty space, south of Centralis and a little bit east of the Southern Terra Firma, “This used to be a peninsula, but was destroyed when the Empress Spoke her Third Word. It is now a stormy, broken area, consisting of thousands and thousands of islands. It is where the arcwhales call home, and the territory of Rhaknam, the arcwhale god.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMTE0ZTdkYmVlNDQxYzdhYTRiY2ZlMzI1MGE0MTcz">Amelia felt herself gulp. In the game Speaking the Third Word was just an extra powerful area-of-effect attack! It wasn’t something that could rip apart the land!</p>
<p class="cnM3NjI2Mjg0MjdkMTQxZGNhNzNlMzk2NDUyZjQwNDZm">“Why did she Speak?” Asked Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTUyNzRhZWQ4NzRjZDA5MmIyZWYxNTAzZGYzYTE3">Serena shook her head, “Get a history lesson from Anathor or Tomes another time. I want to give you a grounding in the structure of the Empire and your place in it.”</p>
<p class="cnM4M2M4N2ZiZmQ4YzQxMDJiNTlhZTVkOGJmMjQwNGE4">“Okay!”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDVmMjEzNmNjMzRkN2VhNWYwNDc0NTA1NTdmOGE5">“Now, each of the four Terra Firmas has an Overlord, and each of those has three or four <em>Greatlords</em> under them. Greatlords are typically also Second Speakers or triple-speakers of the First Word. Each Greatlord rules a region that is comparable in size to a human kingdom of twenty or so million people. Look, you can see on the map how the Terra Firmas are split into these regions.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTJhNGRkZjRmMDQyNGI4OWY4MTA4ZWJhMzczN2Ni">“And, where are we now?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMWJmOWMwZGE4YzRhN2E5MWU5YzI4YWQyOTI4ZTgy">“We’re here, sailing south towards Kenhoro in the Eastern Terra Firma. Now, each Greatlord essentially has their own nation, which they govern in accordance with their Overlord's will, who in turn are given a large amount of freedom by the Empress to do with their territories as they wish. Under each Greatlord are a dozen or more <em>Highlords</em>, who are either promising Speakers or very talented administrators. Highlords govern entire cities or important economic centers like ports.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYTY2YmExYjc2MzQyN2ZiNWZmYjZhNTM3NGQ4YWMy">“Highlord… like the Dragon?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNjE4MzU3MjhiZjQ1YjE5NmQwNjZjZTMwNzNhNTQx">“Yes, and like many Highlords the Dragon occupies other positions in the structure of his Overlord’s administration. The powers given to him from these positions are why he’s so… intimidating. Now, we’re almost done. Below each Highlord is half a dozen Lords, who may or may not be a Speaker, and hold important estates and land within the domain of the Highlord.” Serena took a breath, “Finally, below them are the Lord-prospects. Any demon Speaker automatically becomes a lord-prospect and gains the privileges that come with it, such as hiring a personal retinue. This is also why you refer to me as <em>Lady Halen</em>. Should my service be satisfactory to the Greatlord above me, they may bestow upon me full Cascadian Lordship.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NzhjNGI0ODkwYjRkNTU5NTllMmJmOWI3ZDljNzk3">Amelia took that information in, letting it simmer. She had a thousand questions but could tell Serena wasn’t in the mood for a long lecture.</p>
<p class="cnMyYWY2YzQzYTZlZDRhN2Y5YTVkNmY4M2Q1Y2NlYmEx">“Right, so where do I stand in all of this?”</p>
<p class="cnNkODVhZTA4MTEzYzRmYTJhNzc1YmIyYzM4NTBhZmQy">“<span style="font-weight: 400">Speakers are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">rare</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, even Speakers of the First Word. The military academy that trained me in the sword only sees one or two Speakers graduate a decade, the rest reaching second-level aura, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that’s pretty damn good</span></em>. Most captains of cruisers like the <em>Vengeance</em> are not Speakers. In fact, along with the ship itself being infamous, the fact both me and Korvus were on it made its name and its exploits reach far wider than they normally would.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODNmZWYwY2M5NDRiMjI4NzA2ZWIyN2Y5MTljZjdh">“You are a powerful Speaker, a suspected dual-speaker, or more. You rival the Highlords in power and dare I say it - with how easily you seemed to defeat Korvus and save me - you may even approach the level of some of the weaker Greatlords,” Serena said, jabbing a finger in her direction. “This makes you of <em>tremendous</em> interest to people far above my station, and the station of my father, who is an important Highlord in his own right. Assassination attempts are not out of the question, by either rival demon nobility or from the human nations.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNmQwMDBjMmYzMDQxYjZhMTc2NTA4Y2NiMWNkZjM1">“Huh!? The humans might try and kill me!? Why!?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NjdlOTliNmZiMzQ4NGJiZjAxMjI5Y2FmYjllYjI2">“Once it gets out that you are not, in fact, a captive, and are willingly aiding demonkind, they will try something. You are a Speaker of <em>Aseco</em> and that means you share that branch with the pope himself. They will likely see it is an act of heresy that needs to be stamped out.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNTBlZTM1MWFiYjRlYThiOWVlYWE5N2Q4MzA5NDdk">“Oh.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNWRmMzE5OWVhYTRlYTViNTg1MzA3Zjg0OTlhYmQz">“I suspect for this reason the Dragon is sending us south, to keep you away from the war and knowledge of you from spreading faster than it already is.” A small sigh escaped Serena’s lips. “Of course, alongside potential assassinations and kidnappings, even more demons will try and lure you to their side, bribe you, employ you, you name it. Demonkind has no gods of healing, and thus you are a <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> rare commodity. It’s not unlikely a request will come from the Greatlord himself or… even higher.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMmIxNzNkOWJhNTRhYjY4ZDI4NGQ3NmFlMjZmNDQz">She didn’t like the sound of that! “Nu, uh!” Amelia shook her head vigorously. “I’m staying right here! With you!” She was happy to see Serena smile at that - and if she wasn’t mistaken - she could see the very faintest redness spreading on her cheeks!</p>
<p class="cnM3NzRiMzAxM2QwZTRlNDJiODVlMWRlZWQwOTZiMTFj">“How… loyal.” Serena leaned back on the leather chair, clasping her hands together. “You must be observant in the future. People will approach you directly and indirectly, pretending to be unaware of who you are, meanwhile hidden behind them are the intentions of their masters, or a poisoned knife. I suggest you, if possible, keep ward-spells active at all times, much like how I keep a layer of aura running even when I sleep.”</p>
<p class="cnMyODZjMTA0OWJhZTRiNTA4ZDBiZTUxYzRhMDE4ZDA0">“Understood!”</p>
<p class="cnMxYmM4YWIxMzI2MjRlMmVhZDdmYTNjYjI4MDkzYTE5">“When we travel to Shimashina, and meet my father, there may be complications. Technically as my maid you… belong to me in a sense, and are not directly touchable by the Cascadian Lords, even those high in the ranks. That does not mean some of them cannot apply an enormous amount of pressure and incentives to my father, who may or may not pressure me in turn. It depends…”</p>
<p class="cnMxYTFiNDkxNzlmZTRjMzc4NzM5MWViZmY3ZmQ4MmIw">“Depends on what?”</p>
<p class="cnM4YTExM2Y5YWMyMjQ5YmE5MGIxMzc4MmI3OTgyM2U3">“How much my father likes you.”</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2NlNzc1YzVkZjRiMmJhMGRkMTJiZTM4OTQ4MjQ0">“Heh,” Amelia flashed two thumbs up. “I’ll be on my best behavior!”</p>
<p class="cnM1NTQ0NDI3YTY2NDQ4ZWJiNzcyNTUyMTE3ZTE3Mzli">“Ha! Pfft!” Serena laughed, covering her mouth. “Your <em>best</em> behavior would cause chaos in any noble estate in Cascadia! During the month in Kenhoro, Tomes and I will be thoroughly teaching you some proper manners so you can at least <em>pretend</em> to be a normal dignified Speaker like you should be!”</p>
<p class="cnNmYTZhNjc3MTlmMzQ0MmY4YWRjYTU4NmJjMjlhMjY4">Amelia opened her mouth to protest and then closed it. Serena was probably right. Besides, how difficult could it be? It would be like cosplay, right? To pretend to be some stuck-up rich girl, prancing about with servants and dresses?</p>
<p class="cnNkNGMyZjZkMjQ4MDRhZTlhM2MwNTI1NTRlZjRkNmYw">“Sounds fun! I can- oh no!” Amelia slapped her forehead with her hands. It was a disaster! She had been so mentally drained from the kitchens she had forgotten! “I forgot to bring my share of food! The sardis!”</p>
<p class="cnNlY2I4NTUxMzBjZTQzYTg4MTI4ZmUyY2RiZmY2ZjNm">“Took you a while. Anathor told me as much. Here.” Serena reached into a side drawer and pulled out a plate. On that plate was two - no - two and a half fillets of fish!</p>
<p class="cnNiOTU5MWNjNjJiMjQxNjVhN2YwMGU3MWVjY2Y3OGMy">“For.. for me?” She felt her mouth start watering, as she looked at Serena with wide eyes, trying to put as much pleading as possible in her expression.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmU1OTZkYjBmNDQzMDViN2YzZGJjMDhlYmUzZDJm">“Seven hells, you’re like a starved pup. Stop looking at me like that. Yes, you can have it. It’s cooled down but still tastes as good. I’ll get the rest of my share tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MDBkODZjNDE0YTQzZWQ5M2NkYjhhYjZjZjlkNDIy">“You’re… you’re the best captain in the world!” Amelia bounced up, taking the knife and fork on the plate she cut a piece of fish, which was so tender it was just falling apart. Serena watched her, amused.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjdmNWVlZDBlNDQxNzI4NjcyMmUyZjIzMzczODM2">“Eat up, after which we’ll go on deck and I’ll introduce you to the sword.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNTJhNTBhMGIxZDRlNTM4YzkzZDg1MDFkMDViYzNj">“You’re going to teach me!?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMTkyMzAxZjc4MjQ1NzE5MTBhZjExMjM2ZmY3NWMx">“Yes, idiot. It’s part of your contract, remember? It’ll be good entertainment for the crew and who knows you might have some talent.”</p>
<p class="cnMzOTM2MmIzZDE1ZTQ5Y2I5NjkyNjEwZGE1YWQ2NGEz">“Thank you! I can’t wait!” She placed the sardis in her mouth and chewed, and as the rich flavor filled her senses, she couldn’t stop herself from letting out a moan that in anyone's world probably belonged more in the bedroom than at the table!</p>
<p class="cnM4NmYxOTE3MTNmYTRjZThhN2JiNjQzMmZmNGRiZDRi">The unelegant noise was worth it, as Serena’s eyes darted to look at something else while the redness reappeared on those well-defined cheeks!</p>
<p class="cnNhMTkxZjMzZjJjYjRiZGE5MTFlOTFjN2IzNjgwMmQ4">She devoured the rest of the food and after spending a minute enjoying the heavenly taste that lingered in her mouth, she shook her head and began tying her hair back.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjdmNjc5N2QyODQyNWZhYzVmZTkyYjM2MDYzYmMw">“I’m ready!” Amelia exclaimed.</p>
<p class="cnMyMWY4NTExZDQyZDQzNTc4NTI2NTFjYjg1NDg0ZmM5">It was time for her first-ever swordsmanship lesson.</p>
<p class="cnMzYTcyNDc3ZGMyNTQ2NjBhZTU2MTgzNmZjMTMxYzM3"> </p>

      <description>Chapter Eleven: Sensei</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM3Njg2NzY1YmE5ZDQ1MGRhMjM1OGRmZDBjMDYyNTE3"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNmNmMyZmY1YmY0NDQyMTBhN2Y5NjRiNzgyMzRjOGIz">Amelia gripped the wooden sword with both hands and stared down her opponent. Serena was turned slightly to the side, her own wooden sword pointed to the floor as she exuded confidence. The wind gently rustled her black hair, contrasting against the evening sky.</p>
<p class="cnMwMmI1MWNhMmU1ZTRjZTVhYWM1Y2UxMGI3M2U0ZThj">“First lesson,” she said as she slowly approached Amelia, who gripped the wooden sword even tighter as the threat loomed. “Don’t grip the sword too tightly; you don’t want to tire your hands.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMzVjZDlmYzYwNzQxNTdhMjBlNTEyYTU4YzI4YTU1">Amelia relaxed her hands a little and the moment she did a flick of Serena’s wrist wrenched the sword from her grasp and flung it to the ground.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzhmMWRlNDJjMjQ5NWJiMDNjMWEwNTE3Y2YwNzYx">“Not that loose,” Serena said, a smile forming on her lips.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTZlYmNkYjFmZjQ1NmRiNmRlNGEwZjI4OWY4Yjdj">Amelia grabbed the weapon and once again faced the captain as a titter of chuckles sounded from the others. They were on the first deck, and a circle of demons had formed, providing an impromptu arena. After asking Serena why so many of the crew were watching, the captain shrugged and said, <em>‘Evening entertainment’</em>!</p>
<p class="cnMzN2RjODU3MTA0ZjQwNWVhM2Q1NWFhY2I2YWQ0OTE4">“Second, let’s fix the stance,” Serena motioned with her sword. “Feet. Keep them slightly more than shoulder-width apart for better balance.” After adjusting her stance, the sword was pointed at her knees. “Don’t lock your knees; stay flexible and ready to move. Bend them slightly to lower your center of gravity.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZGQ5MzkzY2Y5YTQ2ZTE4NTFiMDc4ODdjNDM1NTRl">“Like this?” Amelia adjusted her stance as best she could from the instructions.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTc0NmMyNDA2ODQ3MjliNDYyYzdiY2MyMDBjMWY5">“Yes. Your stance is the most important thing. Everything else will be built from it. This one is called <em>Hachiji-dachi</em> and is the <em>natural stance</em>. Now, tense your body and feel how little force is needed to tip you over.” Amelia clenched her core and Serena placed a hand on her collar, slowly applying pressure. Doing her best to ignore how her heartbeat skyrocketed, she focused on how her body quickly began tipping backwards. Unconsciously, she moved her back foot to stabilise herself.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjJjOWY4NGU1MzQzNzM5YjUyNTcwMjcyNDhjMWQ2">“Not a lot, right? <em>Hachiji-dachi</em> is your gun and sword, it-” Serena stopped at the questioning look Amelia cast her way. “... What?”</p>
<p class="cnM5OTlkZWRiOTE2MTRmZmU5OWZjOTM0OWM4YjVjZjBi">“Gun and sword? Is that an expression?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMzQ5MDdlN2FmNDRkZTQ5YTU1MmM5YjQ4OWM4OTgz">“... Yeah. It means your foundation. Something you become so proficient in you can always fall back to it.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNTNmZThlNDU0MDQzZGY4NzdiMmM4Njc3MWY3YWI4">“We have an expression like that! We call it your ‘bread and butter’! Wait! Do you even have butter here!?” As she thought about it, suddenly a lot of food from her home might not exist here! What about cheese!?</p>
<p class="cnNmYjBhODJmNzNhZTRiYTU5MGFlNDFhZjA0M2U4YTlm">Oh no. She wasn’t sure she could survive without cheese!</p>
<p class="cnMzZWE1NTY5YjZjMDRjODQ5M2ZhMDU1YWNiZjY2MTdh">“Yes, we have butter. Focus on the lesson, idiot.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTM4N2VmMzNjODQyZDlhNjhmMDQ1ZGJmMmU5MDM4">“Sorry!” Amelia gave her a small smile.</p>
<p class="cnMxOWMyMWE5NzMzMzRhZjg4ZTg3ZjkyMzNhYTI2NDNj">“Sorry, what?”</p>
<p class="cnM4MWU0MmMwNDY3ZTQ3NzhhNjQ4OTJjYmRjZDVmNTM5">“Sorry, Lady Halen!”</p>
<p class="cnNmZDI0YmZlY2Y2OTRhOGZiYzhmMGE1MGY5ZjlhOTg4">“Idiot. Call me <em>sensei</em> when I’m training you!”</p>
<p class="cnMxYmEzY2ZmMmYzYTRhMjdhYzdjZmNhM2UyYTgyM2Y3">“Yes, sensei!” She squeaked. The crew forming a circle chuckled at that, and a few jeers were thrown in.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTdhMTA2ZjUxODRjMmQ4ZjkxMmI4YzQ5Zjc1MWQ0">“Don’t be too harsh on her, Cap’n!”</p>
<p class="cnNmZjI3NGNmZDAzNjQzOTdiZWE2M2Y0ZDkxOTQwMGJh">“It’s like I’m back at the academy!”</p>
<p class="cnNlYmE4NmFlZTIwZjRlMzBiNWVkZjViMzlmZTNmYzYx">“Little mouse looks out of her depth!”</p>
<p class="cnM0OTBlNDBkMDg0YTQxNjk4MDMwYmJjZDVjMmRkZmIw">“You’re going to find out why the humans call her the <em>hellfire captain!</em>”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjIxMzg2YWI2ODQ2ZDk5MDEwMzVmZDgyYmUzYjEx">Amelia felt her mouth quiver as a flash of anxiety rippled through her. Maybe asking the captain to train her wasn’t a good idea. Serena did have <em>that look</em> in her eye, after all.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDk0NzZiNmNmNDRkNGVhMWE0NjVlNWMxMWY0NDc1">“Fifty push-ups, go on.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYTAzNWQ0NWQwZDQ2NTg5NmQzZGM0NjMwODQ3YmJi">“Y-yes, sensei!” Amelia got down, but before she could even begin… “Idiot, why have you let go of your sword? Never let go of your weapon. The weapon <em>is</em> the warrior, and the warrior <em>is</em> the weapon. You are one! Grip your sword and do it on your knuckles!”</p>
<p class="cnMwOTgyMDQ4MzE3YjRiZjc5MDA3Y2ZkOWZhODJmMmEz">Serena was enjoying this, wasn’t she? Amelia gripped her sword in her right hand and began doing push ups. She was far tougher than a normal human, so the pressure on her knuckles didn’t bother her at all. Soon, she was lost in the rhythmic motion of the exercise. How much time had passed? She had lost count! Just as she started to feel her muscles slightly protest, a voice called out to her.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjdkOTlkMTMzMjQ0ZWU4MjE2MTM2MzdjODFhMWU4">“Stop! Up!” Amelia scrambled up. “I said fifty, and you did a hundred. What am I to do with a student who cannot follow instructions, I wonder?” Serena tilted her head, placing two fingers on her cheek with an expression of mock distress.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTNiNzdjM2JjZTRhOWM4MDM5ZmY4ODNhYjg3ZDU5">She was definitely enjoying this.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDVjZTkzYjcxNzRjNjA4M2FhZDZhOGYzZjBjZjU5">“Still, your physical endurance is exceptional, which is expected of someone who has communed the First Word. You have your wards active, yes?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMDg4ZWZlNzJhYzRjZjM4MDM4N2MzYmNiZjYwMmFh">“Yes, sensei!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NWIyZmQ1ZDcxMzRhNzlhOGIxYjEyNTNmOWU0MDMw">“It depends on the talent of the mage, but ward-spells are roughly equivalent to a warrior's aura in defensive ability.” Serena took out her firearm, pointed it at Amelia's chest and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjA0M2QxNzQ2OTQwOWQ5ZWNiOGNhZTVlNWUwYjIz">The gunshot was like a crack of thunder. Amelia flinched, felt an impact, and smelled gunpowder. She… she had shot her!</p>
<p class="cnNlYmFhMjU2OWY2YjRmZTE4MjBjNjhjNGRkNzNmNGQ1">“You shot me!” She exclaimed.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTM1ODQ4NTQ3MzQyZDFiNWViZGI2ZGZjZjYwYWE3">“Yes, it was rather an enjoyable experience.” Serena spun the firearm on her finger before bringing the barrel to a stop under her lips and blowing on the smoke. Amelia had to admit, it looked pretty cool! “I’ll make a habit of it if you don’t follow my instructions.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjkxNTlkMzRkYTQyYjk4NGQ1NDFkZjM3ZDMwZWNi">“From the attempt on your life, you’re already aware of how difficult it is to hurt you with conventional weapons. However, the noise of gunfire will still induce panic and shock to the inexperienced, so we’ll work on fixing that with you.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MWIwNTc4MzNjMDQxNmFiZDcyODFhNzE0ODE2MTQx">She couldn’t believe it! Serena was going to keep shooting her! Sure, she wasn’t in any real danger, but she was still getting shot! Amelia resisted a small sigh escaping as she resigned herself to her fate of being a bullet sponge.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDY2M2NlZTEwZDRmZDE5YmRhNmE1MDVmN2U1MzI3">“A first-circle ward from a mage is roughly the same as a first-level aura of a warrior. It will make you unreachable by most handguns.” Serena calmly continued with her explanation as if shooting her maid was the most natural thing in the world. “The second-circle, and second-level will protect you against most rifle-fire. You should always keep something active at all times, if possible.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYzEwYjhhODI1NTRjZWI5MTg5ZjQ4OGZjYTk1MWU0">Amelia nodded. She was running the <em>Ward of Thew</em> constantly, which moderately boosted her characteristics. On top of that, she had stacked a second-circle and two third-circle wards from the <em>Aseco </em>branch that significantly enhanced her defence against physical and magical attacks. All of these were cloaked because she glowed like a miniature sun if she didn’t.</p>
<p class="cnNlYWIyMzYxZGQ3ZDRlZDE4OWRjNDIzNWI5ZmRkYmJj">She had more defensive spells from the demonic branches she was more familiar with, but she refrained from using them. Amelia didn’t know what kind of detection abilities others in this world had, and she didn’t want her communion with the demon gods to be known. Not yet.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDUyMWUzYTBiMjQyYThiOWZkZjM3ZDA2NDFkMjBl">“A half-decent warrior or mage is resistant to most forms of conventional warfare, which is why we use these.” Serena wiggled her sword. “The martial weapons can be reinforced with a warrior's aura or spells so they can cut through ward spells and auras, as well as not break under the forces required to do so.” An orange hue appeared across Serena’s skin, shimmering in the evening light. The aura spread from her hand to cover the sword, causing it to take on a subtle orange tint.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzJlYWJkOTQ4MDQ0MGNiZjVkYTE3MzcyYzY2NWU2">“Take your stance. Spread your wards to your weapon. Angle your sword like this to receive my strike.” Serena demonstrated the position, and Amelia did her best to mirror it while wrapping the sword in her magic. The captain raised her sword and struck down, collapsing Amelia’s guard and stopping just short of her throat.</p><span class="cjBlZTNmOGE1YzRkODQ2NWE4MGNmODc1YTc4YTllYmZl"><br/>Stolen story; please report.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlNmY5YTFiOTM0OTQ2OWNiM2U0OTQyNWI3NzlhM2Yw">“You need to keep these muscles engaged at all times,” Serena poked Amelia under the shoulder. "Pull the shoulders down. Try again.” Amelia did as she was instructed, and this time, when she received the captain’s strike, her block held firm. However, she was forced to take a step back to stabilise herself.</p>
<p class="cnMwNGY3NjA5YTJmMjRkYjRhYmU0NzI2NWVmY2NlZmY3">“That is the rising block called <em>age-uke</em>. It can be used to parry or take the brunt of a strike. See how you took a step back? Your stance needs adjusting,” Serena used her foot to pull Amelia’s front foot forward, “More. More… there. Bend the knee more. That’s it.” Amelia’s knee was now over her foot, and her center of gravity felt much lower.</p>
<p class="cnNmZjc1MDcxN2ZjNjQ0NmE4N2VlZjMxZmNjMjE4MzM2">“Again. Make <em>age-uke</em>. Receive the strike.” The sword came at her again, but she wasn’t pushed back this time. “Your stance will decide whether an attack breaks your defences or not. This is the front stance, called <em>zenkutsu-dachi</em>. It maximises your stability against frontal assaults, as well as allowing you to strike hardest at the enemies before you.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MDRlYjljMDcwZjQyMmE4MjYxYmExMzQxZmE4N2Nk">Serena moved into the first stance she had shown. “<em>Hachiji-dachi,</em>” she said, before stepping out with one leg and bending the knee bent over her foot, mirroring Amelia. “<em>Zenkutsu-dachi</em>.” Serena then shifted her weight back onto her back leg, making an L shape. “<em>Kokustu-dachi</em>, the back stance. Useful for parrying, baiting attacks, and kicking. Finally, we have,” Serena moved her weight to the center, bending both her knees equally. “The straddle stance for maximum stability and defensive fighting. <em>Kiba-dachi</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM2M2Y3NzU3MmIyZjRjOTZiZmNkMGMwM2JiMzNlNjli">“These four stances are the foundation of the school of combat I was taught in, <em>Shimokan</em>. The stances are your <em>sword and gun</em>, or bread and butter if you like. We will go over them together. Copy me.” Amelia began emulating Serena’s movements as she flowed from one stance to the next. She had no idea about actual fighting, but even as an amateur, she could see the experience in Serena’s footwork and movement.</p>
<p class="cnNlNWNkZTEwN2M4YzQ3OTE4MTNjMjFhNzE5MTA3ODIx">She thought her dexterity, strength, and perception from the game would make her a natural, but the reality was very different. Over the next hour, Serena constantly pointed out and adjusted every part of her body, from her feet to her hips and even the direction she was looking. Her only advantage was her endurance, which allowed her to maintain a deep stance for far longer than an average demon or human.</p>
<p class="cnM5OTg2MmM5ZTA0ODQxOGFiNGNlZmI5M2ZjMDY4Nzhm">Even so, the physical effort built up over time, and Amelia soon started to sweat with exertion. She could heal herself, but Serena instructed her not to.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjgwZjZiZWY0ODQ5YWY4OTgwZjYzODRlYTM2MmZj">Serena showed her several more blocks and had her use them to defend against attacks from all directions in all the different stances, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each position. As time went on, Amelia found herself forgetting she was on the deck of the ship, surrounded by nosey demons. It had become just her and Serena, sensei and student.</p>
<p class="cnM4MjM2MWFkY2MzNTQzMTM5YTgzNGFjYWZlNzZlN2Y5">It was nice to learn something new. Magic seemed to come naturally to her, unfairly bestowed upon her by some higher power. However, the paths of the warrior? This was something else. You had to repeat motions hundreds, thousands of times over until they were ingrained in your mind. Just being strong wasn’t enough. She needed <em>technique</em>, which would take years to develop into proficient muscle memory.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGJhYTllODIzNjRhNTM4ZjY5MTc3ZjkyNWY2ZTRl">Amelia fell in love with the movements. After years of being bedbound, she was doing something she could only dream of before. She could move her body and be rewarded for it! Why didn’t everyone do this? It felt amazing!</p>
<p class="cnNmZDkwMDE5OTU0MjRiMmNhMjhmZjlkYzU3ODA3OWNi">As time ticked on and the sky slowly darkened, Serena showed her a few <em>katas</em>. These were sequences of movements that, if done correctly, would start and finish from the same spot. Amelia lost herself in her focus, only being distracted when Serena would come close to adjust her in this or that way.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODk5ZWE2MjA3OTRlZjNhYzQ4MDdiZTYxMWVkNTMz">She wanted to ask: did Serena’s heartbeat rise like hers when they were close? Did Serena find her blue eyes as pleasant and pretty as she found her crimson ones? Did she feel as comfortable as she did around her, as if they were life-long friends? When she looked at her with an examining eye to correct her stance, was it all business, or was there any interest in her body at all?</p>
<p class="cnM0OGJmODI4Yzc4NTRhZDA4ZmYxYzk2ZmVhZGRmZmM5">“You're distracted,” came a commanding voice from behind her. “It’s getting late. The body and mind will remember the training when they rest. Let’s end it here.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYTkwMGU0YjUyMzRkYjM4MzhlOWVlMzFjMzY2Y2Qx">“How did I do?” Amelia asked, quickly adding, “Sensei?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNDhjNjJjZTI1ZjQ4NzA4YWJkMzY4NTlhZDUwYjYy">“Above average talent, but nothing exceptional.” Serena peered down on her. “Thank the fell gods. If you were a genius at martial combat, I might have needed to retire. I believe you will grow quickly; your inherent strength and endurance already put you years ahead in that area of development.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmI3MjM5ODk0MjQwMmNhMzMyM2I0ZWViZGViNjYw">“When will I get to, you know…” Amelia swung her sword a few times, unable to stop herself from making <em>whoosh</em> noises. Serena had made her hold the sword throughout the entire training session but never once asked her to strike with it.</p>
<p class="cnM3Mjg2NzJkYjY3ZDQwYWE5MDgyNWM1ZDRmZTZjNjA4">“Next time, if you keep practising the <em>katas</em> in your spare time.”<br/><br/>“Okay! I’ll practice really hard!”</p>
<p class="cnNmYTEwMDc0ZDA0ZDQzZGRhOTBlZWQwZDVkY2NmMTJi">“Good. Let’s retire for the night. I have work to do.”</p>
<p class="cnM5OTkxMDRlY2ExNzRkMzViZjgxODgyNjg2MWEzYjIy"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYzQ3MDAyMDIyYTQ1Yzc4NjU3ZDk2NDBlOWQzMTIz"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM1OTc3YmRkMjIwMzQ1MDBhZDFkMmRhY2Q1YjNkZTY4">Serena sat in her chair and began busying herself with paperwork. Most importantly, she began to think about how to write a letter to her father. From the Dragon, they discovered that he had already been made aware she had hired a human Speaker. Even so, she should prepare a letter to soften the atmosphere that would no doubt be extremely awkward in their upcoming meeting, more than a month out.</p>
<p class="cnNjZTBjY2ViNTNmNzRiNTU5NWQ1N2M5ZjU5NDBhYzkx">Amelia had disappeared into her quarters to wash up, leaving her alone in the captain’s office. Serena tapped the paper, thinking about what she should say. She should probably mention they were training her in etiquette. Her father would pick up on that and be more forgiving of any mishaps. Maybe.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDUyYmJmYjgyYzQ5Y2Y4Mjg4ZDhlOGM4ZDU3MzAy">“Captain,” Anathor said, “Word from the bridge. We just got hailed by Kenhoro perimeter ships.”</p>
<p class="cnM1Yjk3NTU3OTA2NjQ3YjM4Y2UxZGY2YWExZTAyOTdj">“They’re out a bit far. Have sensors sent them our identification?”</p>
<p class="cnNkZTdjNjBjMjk1ZDQ0YTI5OGE4YjhjYmE5YmU0ZjE5">“... Just sent, Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNzFkM2QwNGRhNTQ3OGJiMjAzNDkzMWVjODk4NzFi">“We have visuals? Aetherscope signatures matching?”</p>
<p class="cnMwYjA5MmU1NjkwMjQ3MDRiZmNhZTQyOGZkZWI1MTgz">“Hmm…” the moose mumbled, “Visuals match… signatures matching. Two light cruisers. <em>Moris</em> class. Reply incoming…” Serena waited patiently. There was a speaking tube connecting the captain's quarters to the bridge, which she rarely used. She more often relied on the nicknamed <em>Anathor-tube</em> form of communication.</p>
<p class="cnNhODYzYTNlYTE3YjRiZGViMzExMTFjYThmZjE2ODNj">“Hmm… they congratulate us on our victory and will escort us to the Imperial airdocks in Kenhoro.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjMzNjIyMTZmYTRhMmI4OTEyMDBiMDcwYWRjNzg4">“<em>Will?</em>” Serena felt her eyes narrow. “They didn’t offer?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNzBhMjA3OGEyZDQ2YTFiM2Y3NDA3NGJkOTFkYzFh">“No, Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NDBiNDkyNTkyMTRhYTZhMTg1NDI0OWI1MDBiYTg5">Tsk! She bit her tongue, thinking. “We might have complications the moment we make land. They’re not escorting us. They’re keeping an eye on us.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNTgwYzVkZTFjMjQ4NThiZDAwOWI1Y2JlNmM1MTRj">“Because of the human?”</p>
<p class="cnM3YzFlYjI2N2UxNTRjZTA5M2ZkMGRlMGFmYTVmZmRh">“That’s right.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNTdiYzZmOWM2YjRkNzM5ZjkzYzFjNTFhZDc0OWNk">The side door opened, and Amelia stepped out. “What’s happening because of me?”</p>
<p class="cnNkY2I2YWRmMzk5YjRkZGFhNTFhZWY1ZGQ4OTU2Zjdi">“Kenhoro authorities sticking their-” she looked in Amelia’s direction, reflexively taking a breath. “What are you <em>wearing?</em>” Amelia had removed her uniform and was left in only her undergarments, the loose-fitting top and shorts that left her midriff and legs bare. To make matters worse, she had been cleaning herself up and had gotten enough water on her top that it had started to… cling to her chest.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTAxZGNiNjI1NzRiMTY5ZTY0YmZiNGQ0ZWFlYjY0">“What? I was sweaty from the training, and if you remember, I have <em>no other clothes!</em>” Amelia put her hands on her hips, and Serena found it difficult to keep her eyes from wandering. Amelia was well-proportioned but lacked the muscle definition a trained warrior would have. She looked… soft.</p>
<p class="cnMzZGE1YzgzMGY3YjRlMGI5ODgzNDhlNDI4MjUxNjQ2">Tsk! <em>As if I would find a human... attractive!</em> Serena chastised herself mentally.</p>
<p class="cnM4N2M5YzY2MzBiNDQ1Y2I5ZGY0YzZhZDg2NTJjYmQ4">“First etiquette lesson. Displaying yourself like that-”</p>
<p class="cnM3YzNjMjNmMDQ2MDQ3MzY5M2IwYzNlYTg2ODYxYTk4">“Like what?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NTdhOThjNWU4ZDRkMDk4ZDkxMDhiYjM5NjQ3NTBl">“Like <em>that!</em>” Serena waved a hand, gesturing in Amelia’s direction. “In the presence of not just a captain - but also a noble - is improper, and if anyone finds out, that would only lead to rumours, especially for me!”</p>
<p class="cnNhM2Y5NjJhMDA0ZTQ3MWNhMzIzNzEyMmE4OWZkN2Rj">Amelia tilted her head in confusion. “Why especially for you?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNjYzNzU2NmM4MjRkZGI5MDdhM2RlNTMzYTgzYTc0">“I…” She bit her tongue. That was a mistake. She shouldn’t have this conversation now. She had started to suspect Amelia was somewhat… impressed by her. To discuss the rumours that had been started during her academy days within the all-women’s dorm… would complicate things further.</p>
<p class="cnM1M2U4MzlkZmVjMjQzNzU5OGQ3M2Y5NDIwYTJmYWM3">Even if, as the saying goes, where there was smoke, there was fire.</p>
<p class="cnMwN2YwYTZhYWVlYTQzZmI5MGViOWQ1MTRhZjM5NmJj">“Nevermind. If anyone comes, you disappear into the bedroom, got it?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmQ5M2YyNThhMDRjYmFiZmE3ZmMwZWM1ZmUyOTNh">“Yes, sensei!”</p>
<p class="cnNlY2Y1NGY0MDBlZTQxNjE5NGUwZjhkODY0OGMxZTlj">“It’s only <em>sensei</em> when we’re training, idiot.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MjVmZjI2YjlmMzQ1MjE4M2VjYmExZTI4MjhhNGVh">“Okay!” Amelia gave two enthusiastic thumbs up. The raising of her arms caused her chest to compress, and Serena could not stop her eyes from flickering to the location.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzRlOTBjMDMxYTQwNDViYTFkOTM2MDlmYzRjYWFi">Damn it!</p>
<p class="cnNlYmUyMjYxODNhZDQzNWRiNTVmMWViMDZkOWI3ODVl">“What do you want, anyway?” She said, not able to keep a hint of frustration from her voice.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjNlNThiYmM3OTRiMTlhZmYxYzEyMDMwNWMzOGJl">“I heard you talking about me.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYTE5NmIxZmQwNDQxZmRiMTJlMDE2ZDYyOGRjNDE2">“... Right. We’re being escorted by two Kenhoro authority ships.”</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2RiMGVmNDdmZDQ2YTliMDZiZDlhZmQ2NTM5YWM3">“Cool! Can I see them?”</p>
<p class="cnM4N2ZmYmIwZWEwYjRmODg4NjY1YTE1MmE5ODA5ZWRk">“No, idiot. They’re most likely here because you’re here. They’re keeping an eye on us to see if anything happens. You won't be going on deck tomorrow. You can spend some time with Tomes. He’ll get you started on your letters.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNTk5MWI1ZGNhNTRmNGQ4OGNkMTc0OTQ2NmQxYzk0">“Okay,” said Amelia. “Can I do my <em>katas</em> here? It’s easier to move around like this, and the bedroom is too small. I’ll be quiet! Promise!”</p>
<p class="cnMyMjIyNWYyNjMxODRmN2RiNDBmZWIxODcxN2FjN2U5">“... Can’t you do anything else? I’m trying to work.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTM0ZTRiODRlZDQzMGU5ZDcwNjgxZjMzNzBjZmNj">“Well, I would read, but I can’t really do that, can I? I don’t want to go to sleep just yet… I’ve spent enough time in bed!” Amelia shook her head from side to side. “Besides, doing the katas is fun! It’s a bit like meditation!”</p>
<p class="cnM5YzQ1Y2NhZThhYTQyN2Y4MTVkYjMwMWQ5N2UxOWRj">“Did you… enjoy the training?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDkxMGVkZGYzMTQ0Y2Y5NTM0NWZhYzg5NzU1MjY1">“Mmm, mmm! Sure did! Apart from you shooting me!” Serena couldn’t help but smile at that. It was amusing to see Amelia so flustered. She would have to shoot and stab her at random times in the future - to add some variety and entertainment to her daily life.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTAxMTVjMGNlNTQzNTM4NmQ2M2ViZjZjYTZjMGJk">“You’ve got that look in your eye again, Captain,” said Anathor.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTljYmM3NThhMzRiODM5NWRkYThmOWE4ZDVlZWUx">“What look!?”</p>
<p class="cnNkODE5MDA1MmYxNDRhYjE4YmQ0MzgyNTlkOTc4ODg2">“... Nothing.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNzk2YmI5ZjJhMTQxZDFiODhjYTI1NDQzOTk4Yzg4">“Do your <em>katas</em>. Be quiet, and don’t ask for any help. I have a letter to write.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMGQxYTkwMGY2MDRlNTA4M2E2NTc1ZDVjYzg4ZGMz">“Okay!” Amelia began going through the motions she had memorised so quickly earlier that evening. Serena set about writing her letter, but no matter how much she tried to focus, her eyes kept being drawn from the paper to the person in front of her. She would only look when Amelia was facing away from her, and the more she caught herself looking, and the more she realised where she was looking, the more the realisation slowly dawned in her mind.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDA0YzQ2Y2Q0MTQyMDE4NDE5ZDk5YjUwNzBkOWU3"><em>Over a human,</em> she thought. <em>Really, Serena? You’re such an idiot.</em></p>
<p class="cnM3MzE1MzIyOGM0YzQzYmZiZDlkOWRlOTY3NTA5ZTUz">Eventually, as the last of the evening light faded and the night came, Serena got up from her chair and, despite her earlier statements, gave Amelia some further instructions.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzgwNDYxMDA5MDQ4OGZiYTZmNWNkYTYyZDRjNTEy">After all, it was somewhat exciting to feel how her heartbeat sped up.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzQ4YTkyYzc1YzQyNWE5MmIxZjc3ZmFkY2RlOTdk">When they were close.</p>

      <description>Chapter Twelve: Polina Volkova</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM5NDlhODA3Nzk2ZjQyNjZiZWQzZWEyYzViNzU4Y2Yw"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Polina POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/polina.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjVkZGFkNzI5ZDRlODc4YzBjNmVlOTU5NjUyMjI3">“Polina Volkova?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZWQxYjE3YmRmMjRjMmE5MDkxMjQ3ZTQzODcxNDcx">A speckled youth with a baby face and circles around his eyes called out as he opened the door to her office. They didn’t even knock anymore. It was somewhat understandable, as they were swamped with work from sunrise to sunset, and the juniors were running on less sleep than she was.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjg4NTkzYTkwZTQ5NTU5NTcyNDE2YmRiMjQ1Y2Rm">“Yes…” Polina groaned. It was too early to deal with others. Couldn't she have a little quiet time alone first? “What is it?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NWEyNDFiNzY5OTQ2NTA5ZmVjYTZlYTk2Zjg3OGI4">“Priority from upstairs.” The junior handed her a large sealed envelope.</p>
<p class="cnMyM2EzNmExYmRjYjRjNmVhYjE4ZGY5YzJmYmJmMTll">“Right,” She said, gesturing to the pile of documents and envelopes on one side of the desk. “Shall I put it with my backlog of priority assignments here? Or perhaps…” She waved towards the other side of the desk, where another tower of paper lay waiting. “Should it go under the extra-important priority backlog?”</p>
<p class="cnNmOTUzYmQ0MDgyMDQ4ZmNiYTY3YTY4NTlkYTNiOTAz">The junior shrugged. “It’s more… <em>extra-important</em>-<em>right-now</em> priority,” he gestured for her to look at the document. Polina saw the red stamp pressed upon the envelope and resisted the urge to cry.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzA5YTIxNjllODRjYWM5Y2U4MzQ4MDEwNDc5Y2Mz">“Did he give this to you himself?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MDdkNDAwY2Q4ZDQ1ZDRiYjRlMDJiYzdkMDBkNTY0">“Yes, said to tell you that you’ve got ten minutes.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTVkZjlhNGNiZjRlYjdiYjJjMmEwY2RhMmJiNGEx">“Until?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzJhM2ZlYjU5OTQ3YTBiMzRkOGJkMzMwZGZmN2Vk">“Until you need to be in his office upstairs with an analysis.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNWRhM2FjMzRjNDRjNjRiNWI4YjI0MWFjYTJlOTg0">“Christ!” She waved the junior away. “Get out then! Time's ticking!”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjgwY2VjMTgyYzQ5NDQ4YTY0YmI0NjNhNTk2YjU2">After her door was closed she ripped open the envelope and spread out the documents. She skimmed the summary. It was a report consisting of an aggregation of eyewitness accounts of a recent battle between Republican forces and…</p>
<p class="cnNlMzE3YjE4MTkxOTRmOTJhY2IxMmZjNzdlZmE5YjM1">“A single ship… the <em>black ship</em>,” She muttered to herself as her heartbeat increased. “It’s the <em>Vengeance</em>. You’ve appeared before me again…” Her brain clicked into focus, and the weariness she felt was pushed away. Port Highwind had been taken by surprise, leaving the skies undefended for an assault fleet to push through.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDQyNWYyMjZiMTRkM2U4NTI4NzFjZjM5YzJhZTRj">The report didn’t seem to focus on that. In fact, it didn’t seem that concerned with the <em>Vengeance</em> itself. That was strange. That ship was a priority assignment for the bureau, and there was a team dedicated to tracking it. A team she had desperately tried to get on.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGVjNmIwZDY1YzQzZmI4OWZlZWYwZWRhMjZiYTVk">Polina gave herself a mental slap. Now wasn’t the time for ruminating on the past. The report was more concerned with the testimonies of a group of Republican soldiers - defenders of the port - that had been rescued as they were being transported in an opportunistic strike.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2JmNDU2NzI1ODQ0ZTViOTkxZGVkNjM0NWEzZjhj">She became bewildered at what she read as she examined their eyewitness accounts. “A human healer… gunshots…” As she read further, her eyes widened in surprise. “Serena Halen and Korvus Maranai <em>fought</em>!? They <em>Spoke</em>!?” With renewed vigour, she devoured the information from the other eyewitness accounts.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjk3NWE5MGYwNzQzMTBiNjQ2YmNhYWY5ZTAwNWJl">Just as she was about to start mentally constructing different scenarios, she caught sight of the wall clock. She was late! Polina lept up, scrambling to put the documents back together, and then threw herself out of the office, only just remembering to slam the door behind her. The flurry of her movements caused all the junior analysts on the floor to glance in her direction before returning to their own mountains of grunt work.</p>
<p class="cnMxMGM4NGQ5NjJmMTRjZWFiMDQ2ZDg0YmQ0ODgzNTZk">She ignored them and began leaping up the stairs, taking three at a time. She ran through corridors and almost crashed right through the locked door between her and her destination.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGM0YjgyZWYxNDRlMDg5MjAxYWRiODE2ZjI2YzI2">“Ahh… ahh… Here.” She passed the guard her identification while desperately trying to catch her breath. The guard examined it and then gave her a look of amusement.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTEyMzA0ZjY3MjQ4OTliNzRhMjNhZjUwMDk5ZTM1">“Polina Volkova,” he said, marking her admission in a notebook and opening the door to her. Polina didn’t wait and burst through. Then, conscious of where she was, she forced herself to slow down to a brisk walk as she made her way around the cauldron.</p>
<p class="cnNiZDk4NjEyOWU4ODQxYzU5MGE5Y2EzY2Q0NjQzNjI4">The cauldron was the bureau's centre and shaped like an amphitheatre. The floor's design carried the sound of footsteps throughout the entire space, and no single place was outside the line of sight of at least one standing guard.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTM4YjhiZTYzZjQyMThhYTYzOTE1MDMwYmQzZjEz">Polina found herself at the right door. She took a few seconds to calm her breathing and mind and then politely knocked on it. Almost immediately, the door opened, and in front of her was someone she had not expected to see.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGM5OGVkNjllODQ0MWQ4YTg4ZGRhYjk4MjE0MDE3">“Natalia Marakova?” She said, not intending for it to be a question. The neat black-haired operative looked her up and down with an examining gaze.</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2QxYzA0MTEyMjQ3N2FhOWEyNjEwNjlmYTBmZWEy">“Polina Volkova. How long have you been with the bureau?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMGU2NWMzYzczOTRkOTM4ZGUxMjQ5ZDRjYmNjZmE2">“T-three years, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYTE5MjJmYTcyOTQ2NzI5ZWVjNzllNjI3NWRjOGJj">“And you were recently promoted?”</p>
<p class="cnMwYjFkN2Y4YzhjNzQzMjg5NzNhZjRmNmUyYzgyNGVi">“Yes, senior analyst, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYTUxYTRkODI4NTRjZGJhMWU3NGYzYTRjNTIxN2Jl">“Ever been in the field?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNTkwOTU3ZDQ2YjRiY2ZiOTA4YjYyZDA0ZmFlM2U5">“N-no, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMDQwMDg5MTJlZTRkYzU4ZjQ0NDZhODAwNTNjMDVl">Polina saw Marakova clenching her teeth and sighing through her nose. “Come in,” she said. The office door opened fully, and Polina stepped in, having to duck slightly under Marakova’s arm, which held the top of the door frame. The office was clean and tidy, with leather furniture and a singular desk. This room served only as a conversation area. The actual office lay behind the thick wooden door on the other end of the room.</p>
<p class="cnMwOGRjNTI5ZjllZTQzMDdhNmJkNGI2MTc0OWUxYTU2">Behind the desk was a man with a familiar prominent figure, sharp eyes, short hair and a semi-permanent scowl.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzI0OTBmODE3MDRlZTQ5NDM0YTQ2MzYxMzgyZWFl">“Boris Ivanov,” Polina said in greeting.</p>
<p class="cnM4NTA1YzNjZDFlZjQ1MDJiMzlhYTdkM2JhYWJiNzg2">“Polina Volkova. Welcome. Would you like a coffee?” Director Ivanov said, gesturing to the equipment on a side table. Polina swallowed reflexively. She <em>was</em> running on little sleep, and coffee beans were getting harder and harder to source these days.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmFmNjQyZGE5YTRkMzdiZWM0NWVlMzI2NDIwNzMy">Of course, top brass like Ivanov and Marakova would have their stockpiles.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDIwMDFmYzQxNTRlMzE4NTQ3MjkzN2NmNTVkZjVh">“Yes, thank you, Director Ivanov.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MTQyMzE4YzAzMzQyMDZiY2RjODNlNTc0MzQ3Yzhi">“Go on then.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTE3NGNhMjIwMzRkNDQ4MGU0NDc4MzMyZjE4NmM5">“Y-yes!” She placed the report on the table between her and Marakova and hurried to the side to grind the beans.</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2ZiODc3ZGM3YTQ2ZGRiN2EwMWFhNzhlOWY0NjEz">“Senior Volkova, make me one as well. Strong,” Marakova called out to her.</p>
<p class="cnNiNDgxNmZjZjllMDRmZjBhYTNhMGRjOWY5MjFhMjcz">“... same for me,” the gruff voice from the desk said. Polina found a third cup and began the slightly laborious but oddly satisfying task of grinding the beans with a hand grinder. The smell of the rich coffee soon filled the room, an irresistible fragrance that made her mouth water.</p>
<p class="cnMwODcxYTU2NzVlZjRmNTRiMDk4MWVmZTE4ZTEwMTQx">“Boris, are these…?” Marakova trailed off.</p>
<p class="cnNiMzkxNTQ0MjhmMjQ3NjVhNTE4NjZlNWFhMTFiZjdh">“Jimari beans. Last batch I could get my hands on before Cascadia stopped exporting coffee to us.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZThjYjk4ODc2ODQzYjFiNGNkODgxOTY1MTI5ODU4">“How unfair that the demons possess most of the tropical climate where coffee can be grown at scale. Our greenhouse-grown variants taste awful.”</p><span class="cjZkMDI3ZDBmZTAwZDQzYTBhYmJhNjhiYWMwMjAwNzNk"><br/>Support the creativity of authors by visiting Royal Road for this novel and more.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmNjMzZDBlNmIwOTQzOGU5ZGJmZmQ1M2MwOWNjY2Ez">Polina continued preparing the coffee, adding the beans into the small press and adding hot water. The fragrance from the beans was already noticeable, but now the room smelled like a street cafe. The coffee grown in the Southern Terra Firma was not kidding around.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWNmNzRjNzdmYzRlMzZiZTY4Y2U4MzAwMTNiOWVj">“Do… any of you take sugar?” She asked the room.</p>
<p class="cnM4NjI2ZTc3NjNkOTQwZmM5YzQwNzBlYjUzMmFmMjhk">“No,” the others replied in unison. Polina poured three cups of the Jimari coffee and then finished hers with two spoonfuls of sugar. She handed the others their cups and then sat with her own opposite Natalia Marakova. As the others seemed content simply enjoying their drinks, she quietly sipped her own, savouring the taste.</p>
<p class="cnNhNmViZjhjNmU3MDQ1ZDY5ZjIxZWU2ZDVlZjBmNjNk">After a few minutes of silence, and just as Polina was starting to suspect she had only been summoned so that she could make these two their coffees, Boris Ivanov began speaking.</p>
<p class="cnNjMGFlNDQzZTYwYzRhM2Y4YTUyMzFjNTNiNDcyNzgx">“Polina Volkova.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNjlhZTQ4ZDQwNzRkY2U4OTM3YTM0MzViZjkzYTgy">“Yes, Boris Ivanov?”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDRiMWJkY2NjZDQ0ZDA4MDNlM2I0MmEwNTliZTgw">“We are familiar with each other, but what do you know about Natalia Marakova?” He said, grasping his hands together. It was his sign that it was time for business. Polina placed her cup down.</p>
<p class="cnNhY2QyNGZjNTAwMTQyNzZiYTdkYmEyNjkxZTUwZjUx">“Ma’am is the team leader for the group that is responsible for monitoring and tracking the <em>Vengeance</em>.” Polina tilted her head politely at the woman across from her. “Pleasure to meet you in person, ma’am.” Marakova merely gave a small grunt in response.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTk0OGYzNDAzYTQxZmZiZmIwZmNiNzc2MzU2Njgz">“Not just the <em>Vengeance</em>,” Director Ivanov said, “They also track its captain, with whom I know you are familiar. Serena Halen, yes?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ODEzNjllZjRlMDQ5M2ViYmZjM2VmZjlhNTkxNTM0">“... Yes,” Polina resisted the urge to clench her fists.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjVjYTEyNmEyNjRlMDY5YTA2NmQ0NDVlZDdjOWU1">“You also applied to join their field team earlier this year and the year prior?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjZiODdkNDMwZTQwMGVhODM3Yjk5ZmI4Y2MyZjNl">“That’s right.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MDVkMzI2YTc2MTQ2MjI5OTY5NmMyNTc0MGFmYjE3">“It was I who rejected you,” Marakova said. “Your personal… dislike of Serena Halen made you unsuitable for fieldwork on my team.” The woman eyed her calmly. Her words had no emotion or bias—pure logic and rationality.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTQwMDk1MGNlMTQyODA4ZDk1NzFkNjZjNDZiMzIw">“I… understand.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMTY4YWY4YmY0MjRkN2E5OGJlODA2MDhjNjIwMzdk">“Did you finish reading the report?” Director Ivanov asked.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzgwYWY0NGRmYzQwMmRhZTIyNWJkMWIzZDZiZDlk">“Yes, Director.”</p>
<p class="cnM2YWY1N2I0YTBkNjRkNWU5OTI5ZTI2MTk2YzliZTBl">“And?”</p>
<p class="cnM4NWEzZTdiNTBmOTQ5ZTQ5Yjk2NmNmZGI5NDJiZDQ4">“Well…” Polina breathed, collecting her thoughts, “If the sheet of graduates in the report is accurate, then there are no church graduates of <em>Aseco</em> with the name <em>Amelia</em>. Therefore, she slipped through the cracks, or the name was false. Her physical description is generic enough to match half the female students in the healing or protection branches.</p>
<p class="cnNlODUxYjkwYTg4NjQ3NzFiNjMxZDc1Y2U1NzFkZjA2">“It’s unlikely to be a demon illusionist, as the healing was real by the accounts. We can assume she <em>is</em> human. She claimed to be a travelling healer and was under the employment of Serena Halen,” Polina paused, shrugging slightly, “It’s <em>possible</em>. I understand Serena Halen’s personality is that she is quick to anger and reckless. She is also hostile to humans, but not mindlessly, like Korvus Maranai.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYjRhNGQzNDM4MDRkN2NhNjJlNTQyY2I3NTBiYzNi">Marakova nodded at that. “The healer showed no signs of captivity or being forced to be there. The demons have no gods of healing, and Serena Halen is rational enough to take the opportunity to employ a human healer if she finds one that isn’t hostile to demonkind.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNDUxMzFkODg2MTQyNDQ5YmYyNjAzYmUzY2FkMDQ5">“Yes, ma’am,” Polina agreed, “And given that the <em>Vengeances’s</em> stormtroopers, led by Korvus Maranai, tried to assassinate her, it might explain why they fought. It fits their personality profiles… the only thing that doesn’t add up is the healer because she-”</p>
<p class="cnNjMGFmMmQ4ZTQxZDQ4YzJiYTI2NTA3YzQ3MTM3MmIy">“-survived the assassination,” interrupted Marakova, “Meaning she’s at least second-circle to withstand that level of gunfire. But it gets even more weird. After Korvus and Serena Spoke, the aether release caused dozens of casualties in the square where the soldiers were held. The healer not only survived but then cast a field spell that healed everyone at once!”</p>
<p class="cnMwNTFkYjFiZTZkZjQ1NWQ4MDQ5YTE3MjUzMzBjZDAy">“Which would make her a talented third-circle mage,” Polina said, "With a cloaking spell, as she must have had wards running but was not reported as glowing."</p>
<p class="cnMzNzYwMDY1MWJiNDQ0MWFhOTI5NmZhMmEwMmY4MjNh">“With <em>enormous</em> aether reserves, and if it’s true that she healed a hundred people in a row, that is impossible.” Marakova jabbed a finger onto the table, “The academies only produce a handful of third-circle mages each year, and they are <em>all</em> accounted for. Sure, some healers have gone missing in action on the Republican lines, but they don’t match her physical description or capabilities. The church would have already discovered and hoarded a mage that could cast a healing field spell, so they could commune with the First Word.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NGFhMjhjMjExODRkMDZiY2M1ODJiNjIzNDIyZmEy">An impossible healer who appeared in an impossible situation with impossible capabilities. It was a compelling mystery.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWE5YzYwNTY5NjQ2ZmY4M2VhOTAyYzBjZGMzMDMw">“The reports of holy lightning attacks shortly after also complicate things further. Their reported size even suggested they may be <em>fourth-circle</em>. What do you make of that, Senior Volkova?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNzJhMTQzYzM5MTRmYzA4MTA4MzRiYWE5Yzk5Nzgy">“Uh… it must be exaggerated. Soldiers typically aren’t exposed to magic higher than the first circle so they often misrepresent the power of minor spells. Furthermore, only two Words - one by Serena Halen and one by Korvus Maranai - were Spoken so it cannot be fourth-circle magic. However, the lightning attacks are consistent with what we know of <em>Aseco</em>, and the blue flecks of light reported when the human healed the soldiers is further evidence of that branch.”</p>
<p class="cnNhN2I4ZDZjN2RkZDQyNDE4OWUwMzZlOTNiNzdlMDA5">“You can see why we have such a problem,” Director Ivanov interjected, “We have evidence of the impossible. A third-circle <em>Aseco</em> healer that is seemingly as proficient in healing as they are in combat. It takes an enormously long time to become proficient in just one discipline of <em>Aseco,</em> and that’s with all the aid of the church. This woman was reported to look youthful. She should be in her late forties, at a minimum.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MGExYmY4M2UzZjRiNmJhZjIyZjk2NWRiZjU0NTI0">“Not only that,” Marakova continued, “My team tracked the <em>Vengeance</em> in the weeks and months leading up to this event. Not once was there any indication of a human being onboard that ship. We also witnessed no significant tension between Serena Halen and Korvus Maranai. The only thing that explains their behaviour is…” The team leader raised one finger, “That the captain somehow kept the healer a secret from both us and him, or…” A second finger went up, “The healer somehow boarded the ship after it left the dock out of range of our trackers.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NGM4ZDAwNjVhODQ5NTViNDViYWMwMjk5YWU4ODRk">A thought struck Polina. “Is it possible she’s a church spy? A secret mission from the senior leadership?” As she asked the question, the director and team leader glanced at each other for a moment. After their silent communication ended, Boris spoke up.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTYwYjI0NWQ1MjQ3NmM5MmEwY2ZjMzY3ODcyOGJj">“This is a little beyond your pay grade, but just know what information we are receiving from the church high command very much indicates this is as surprising to them as us.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNTg5ZmQxZWM1YTQ5ZGY4YTNlNjk1MmE4MzNiMzhi">“Then…” She shrugged. “The puzzle pieces must fit together somehow. We don’t have enough information… Where is the ship now?”</p>
<p class="cnM4NzhkODQwZGZmMjQyMDU5NGY1OGIwZjNkOTdlYzlj">“We received word it passed the Kenhoro perimeter not long ago,” Marakova said, “The report didn’t go into much detail, but the <em>Vengeance</em> took a hit. It’ll be facing a month of repairs at least.”</p>
<p class="cnM2YjcyZWE1N2FkYzRlZTBhMDMzNGQyNWIyN2FkMTMz">“Are we able to get an informant on board? Bribe one of the crew?”</p>
<p class="cnNkODcxNzVmMmJlNjRjNTNhNzQ4YTRiNWM3YmQ3M2Ey">“It won’t work,” Marakova said, shaking her head.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTFiZjRlNWI5MjRkNTViZThjYTljOTc3OTgwNjVj">“Are they that loyal to her?” Polina asked.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzE3MmUzNGJmNTQ0ZTM4MzdkN2U3OWViMmZjODgw">“They are loyal, but that isn’t the reason. The ship has a guardian on it. An advisor to the captain. A Formless.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNmE3NzAyM2E1MDQyOGQ4ZDVhNmE1NTc5YzljMzc2">Polina gulped. “So it’s true then, the stories?”</p>
<p class="cnM5OWIwYzMyODVjZjQ2OTA5MjgzMTVlMDdhMWQwNGZk">“Yes. He sees and hears everything on the ship, and is sensitive to the intentions of those who board it. You cannot trick him for long. We either have to bribe or capture the crew when they’re on land leave or resort to observing from a distance.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDc1MTc4ZjY0NjRmMmQ4ODllNTM1MGViZGQ0YWJj">“I see…” Polina said. “With respect, Director, ma’am. It appears my line of thinking has matched your own. I apologise for not being able to come up with anything new.” She tilted her head in apology.</p>
<p class="cnMyMzZmMzA0MzBhYTQ0N2ViNTFhY2I3NTA1Y2Q0MjM3">“Head up, Polina Volkova,” Boris said, his frown slightly softening, “You were not brought here for just an opinion. That report - and this conversation - was your briefing.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMmMxNmRhZGNlNTQyNGM4YjA1ODNiMGNiZmJlYmYw">“Director?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMzJmMDhjYTQ3ODQyNWViNWIxZmFkMzljNjc0NDhl">“Your <em>blessing</em> has been of great assistance to the bureau on many occasions, and it has been one of the major reasons we’ve kept you behind a desk. You’re too valuable to risk in fieldwork.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDFjODc5YTU3MTQxNGE5NDYxNmZmZjMwMjZlNGMx">“Ah… thank you, Director,” she mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmEwNDdmOTQ4NjRkMmY5Y2NhYmU1Mjk1MGFhZjIy">“However, after this event, I’m under a lot of pressure from my superiors to find out about the nature and origin of this healer.” Polina swallowed. There were not many people ranked higher than the director. He must be under mountains of stress, like her. “Therefore, a decision has been made, against the recommendation of both Natalia Marakova and me, for you to join some of her team members who are setting up a cell in Kenhoro.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMDIzNTUwZDAxOTRmMzM5MGQwNWIyYzc4NTZkYzJl">Fieldwork! They were sending her outside the office! Away from paperwork! She would finally be closing in on her nemesis!</p>
<p class="cnNkMTIxYWE0MjliMDQzYzNhZGRmNGI5MGQ5ZDdmNTlm">“It’s an honour!” Polina exclaimed, feeling a smile erupt on her face. “I won’t disappoint you, Director, ma’am!”</p>
<p class="cnNjMjg1MjMzMWFmZjQzN2M4YmEzMGY3NmFjZTQ4ZmRk">“We’ll see…” Marakova mumbled. “We will be leaving tomorrow, circling east and taking the trade winds to Ponan. From there, we’ll travel to Tanhea and then Kenhoro. We’ll cover as a merchant group. You’ll have a new identity. You’ll have to learn much as we go along, so pay attention.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YmJhYmE2MTBlMjQ1ODNiYWE2NjBjMTM4NDliZWI3">“Yes, ma’am!”</p>
<p class="cnM2MTgzMGZlMTFjOTRjMzBhYjE3Njc5ZTM5MzI0YWM0">“I mean it,” she raised a finger to make a point, “Half the trackers we send after that ship drop off the face of the continent after a few months. Cascadia has a tremendous interest in that ship, and their own ministry of intelligence has agents working counter-espionage to protect it. There are conditions. Under no circumstances are you to approach Serena Halen if given the opportunity.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYWQ3ZGY5MDE1NjQ2ZDE5MGJmYTIxNjM4YWZhNTgw">“I understand!” Polina said, trying to exude the picture of obedience. Inside her mouth, however, she bit her cheeks. Would she be able to resist, to stop herself?</p>
<p class="cnM3NWRiMWIwZmIzMTQwYjM4NmU5N2UzZjcyZDFmNzgy">“Secondly, under no circumstances are you to board the ship. We are there to observe and gather intelligence, not to infiltrate the crew. Understood?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMTY3M2E1ZTA3MTQ2YjU5NDIxZjBlMjE2MTM0MzE1">“Yes, ma’am!” Polina nodded.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDcyYTdhZWVlMzRmNmU4YmJjN2M4OGE3ZTFhZDdh">“Very well, Polina Volkova,” Director Ivanov said, “Return to your office. Delegate your remaining work to the juniors. Natalia Marakova will collect you at the end of the day.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNGUyZWQzMTgxZDQ3OTc5NTRhMTMwMjJkOTU1NTM0">“Yes! Thank you for the opportunity!” Polina stood up, and with a final expression of gratitude, she left the office. Walking back to her office, she couldn’t resist humming.<br/><br/>Her blessing had finally come through, giving her the opportunity she needed to get close to Serena Halen. She had begun to resent it, thinking it was too valuable for them to ever let her do fieldwork. This event had changed everything, and now the need for intelligence tipped the scale in her favour.</p>
<p class="cnM4NGU4ODgxMDRlNDRmNmFiN2Q0YjJhZGRjNzIxYjg1">Thank the gods for blessings!</p>
<p class="cnM3NTllZGYyODIyNjQwOTFiODEzY2ExNmE4OGZlZjM0">Not just the one she had shared with the director.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTQxOTA0MjM3ZjQxYTZhODM4OWIyZjRjOGUyY2I3">The other one, too.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDViZTJlMTAyZDQwMGY5NGU5MzdmNzg3MWRjY2E1">The one she had never told anyone about.</p>
<p class="cnM5NGM5ZDE2YWQ5ZDQ3MjI4ZGQ1YTc0ZDU0MzBiZDI4">The one she would use to kill Serena Halen.</p>

      <description>Chapter Thirteen: A Puzzling Nightmare</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM5MWY0YzRlNjVjMTQ0ZDhhNDc2NjQ2YmU3Y2JiZTI0"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM4MzQ1MDcyOGM5MjRjYTA4YzMxMTAzMjc3YTE2NDU5">Serena’s thoughts were muddled - like pushing through tar - she tried to figure out why the old stairwell was oddly familiar. She had been here before, but when? It felt like… the <em>Vengeance’s</em> stairwell. However, things were different and not quite right. Where were the steel deck plates? Why were there greasy oil lanterns hanging from the walls instead of the usual aetherlights?</p>
<p class="cnM4NDlmZTgzMzNkNDRiYzViYTRhNmI1MmQ0YTM1MGQw">“I’m dreaming again,” she muttered, the sound of her voice reaching her ears a half second after she spoke. An unnatural fog clung around her, muffling sounds and preventing the light from reaching too far. Serena unhooked one of the oil lanterns and cast it about, peering through the darkness. The metal hinge on the lantern squeaked as she moved.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzM3MGRmOTA0ODQ0ZjVhMTM0ODU2NjI1NzI5N2Ri">There it was again.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTQ3ZmI2YjExNzQ2YmQ5MjkzNDNhMWVmODFhNWFk">The heavy wood door stood before her. The familiar words etched into it. <em>Fourth Deck</em>. Why was she here again? Serena tried to think and remember. There was something… something about Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjgzNDVhYmIzYjRlMzVhMjdiMjUwYzlkMWE3NDk2">She found her hand holding the key. The captain’s key. She looked at it. Why was it here? Serena slowly moved her eyes to the defiant door in front of her. There was something coming from within. Serena pressed an ear against the hardwood.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjE0OGQ0YmQ5ZTQzMDM4MDBjNWE1ZDI1ZjVjN2U0">Music. Singing. The mournful song flowed into her ears, and she couldn’t stop a tear from falling down her cheek. Why would someone so talented be singing such as sad song? Serena felt a chill, a sudden drop in temperature, and the song stopped. She looked down and saw she had inserted the key into the lock.</p>
<p class="cnNhMGU0MTJmNzBjNzRjZGY5MGQwM2UxZjk0OWFmNDA5">“No,” she whispered, “The fourth deck is off-limits, even to the captain.” Serena forced herself to remove the key, and as she did, it evaporated into white mist. “Only the one who made the agreement may enter,” she mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTRjNjE2Mzk1MjRmZTJiYTExMzgwZGNmZDUwYWNl">When had she learnt that?</p>
<p class="cnNhYmRmNTFiNjY3YTQ2YjRiNDE3NjcxNzUwM2I1ZmQy">Heavy footsteps sounded above her.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzBmNzQ4ZjczMTRmODY4ZTgzMjUxYmQ4MzhmMWYx">“Who’s there!?” She called out, the delayed and muffled sound disorientating her speech. Serena scrambled up the stairwell, chasing after the person. “Wait!” She yelled, following the noises through twists and turns of the corridors, only her oil lamp giving her any light.</p>
<p class="cnM4MjZmNzIwOTMyNDQ5ZmZiNzU0OTJiZDE3NTZiYmMy">Serena turned a corner as the sound of a door closing echoed in the space. It was a familiar door with familiar brass lettering upon it.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWUyNWExZWZlZjQ4OTg5NjFiNTZkMmUyZjc0YWRk"><em>Captain's Quarters</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDNmY2Y1OWIwMzQwMDZiYjljNmEyMTNlNzBlNTEx">“This is my room…” she whispered, placing a hand on the doorknob and twisting. She stepped through and found herself not in a room but standing on a field of fog that reached out as far as she see. There were no walls and no ceiling. Just darkness and a floor of fog.</p>
<p class="cnM1YjBjYzJjNzYwNTQ3Y2E4ZGY1MzM3MjJkNWQxZWVl">There was something else. A man, sitting in a chair, facing away from her. He wore a brown uniform, and the edges of a grey bushy beard could be seen. On his head, he wore a triangle-shaped hat. A captain's hat.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzc1ZTExNWQ5MjRlYmFhM2NlZDAzMDZlNTBhOTMz">Serena approached him but found that the closer she got, the harder the fog became to walk through. It was pushing her back, resisting her presence like it didn’t want her there.</p>
<p class="cnNkNmUxNTY1NWY4NjRlMmNhNWQ4OWM2NzQ0MDMwMDRk">“Hey!” She called out. The man turned his head slightly.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmY5ODNlNDU1ZDQ5MjA5NDcyOWQzYThjMmEwZGM4">“You’re here.” A deep, gruff voice croaked out that seemed oddly familiar. She couldn’t place it.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGE4ZTU4ZTVmYzQwNTA5NjU1NDg0NmI1NjlkM2M0">“Who are you?” She asked, fighting against the fog. She was a few meters away from the man but could not get closer, no matter how much she exerted. The fog began frothing, becoming agitated at her continued attempts. It clung to her now, working its way up her body.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjYwYTUyZjcyOTRhYTE5MDNiM2E2ODVhMzQ4MGY4">“You’ve committed a cardinal sin. There will be a punishment,” grumbled the man.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjU5MzkzYWViNTRjZjI4Yjk3OWMyOTQ5Y2M0NzFl">“What sin!?” Serena yelled. “Who are you!?”</p>
<p class="cnNjZmI5ZGQ1NzgxNzQxZDFhZDc2ZDNiOGY5YmFmZDcw">A moment of silence while the fog engulfed her, blocking her vision. At the last moment, she saw the man had begun to turn into white mist.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDAxNjJhMTEwNDQ5NjliYTA4MTc5ZGY4OTE1MjM4">“Too late… You must protect the girl...”</p>
<p class="cnNmMzg3NjY0YWJhNzRiYjg5ZjEzODNlZjFiY2I1MTVi">“Protect who? Amelia!?” She choked out as her vision turned back, and she was wrenched from the dream into the waking world.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjgyYzQzNTc2MTQxMzk4NTI1MTlhOTlmZWM1ZDE1">“Amelia!” Serena shouted, sweat running down her forehead.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzQ4YTFkMDJiMjRjMzA5YTljZTAwZjZjNGFlOTAy">“Hello, yes, that’s my name.” Came the reply.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzUyZjc5ZTZmYTQ3MjU5NTgzYzE0MGFiNDAwZmNm">Amelia, wearing her white and blue uniform, stood in the doorway to the bedroom. She was carrying a plate of steaming sardis. Her mouth opened as she tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2EyZmY3ZGQ2NTRhY2Q5OGZmYzIxZDJmYmQzMWI5">“Were you having a nightmare?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTYzZmIzOTQ3NTQyYjk5MWQwZWY2ZTc4NTk1OGY3">Serena took a few moments to calm down. Yes, it was a nightmare. “Quick!” She exclaimed, “Pen and paper!” Seeing Amelia hesitate for a moment, she leapt from the hammock and pushed past her into the office space. She sat down at her desk and began trying to remember the events.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmIxYjkwM2M0YzQ4MDBhNjM2MDRkM2JhOTAyNDEy">“Fourth deck… fourth deck… was it open or locked?” She scribbled what she could remember. Was there music? There was a man. Someone had committed a sin. It didn’t fit together! Damn it!</p>
<p class="cnNhMjE3OTYzM2FkZTQ0NGZhZDE0YWE2MTE0ZmYwMzJi">Something at the end. She had to protect someone.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTcyMjJjNGVkYjQ4MDhiYzAxNGFjZDg0ZGIzODJl">“What’s going on?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDg2MWQxOTIxOTQxOTdiNWRlNmFjNjA5OTA4ZmMx">Amelia. She had to protect Amelia. Who told her that?</p>
<p class="cnM1NmIyNWM2Njc3YTQ5YTg5MDQ5Y2ZjMGQ5NzA3YzJm">“Anathor,” she said. The moose responded almost immediately.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTdjZjJiZWNiYjRmZThhZjg0ZTljOGViYmNiYzg2">“Yes, Captain?”</p>
<p class="cnNlYzliZjFmYzRjNTQ5ZjVhZTNlYzliNTJiODNlOTM1">“I think the ship is trying to talk to me. I’m having dreams again.”</p>
<p class="cnM5OTkyNjIwNzc0NjRlNWE5MDgyMDY1ZjQ1YjNmNzI2">“Hmm… Can you understand it?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNWYxZmI1NGFlYTQ5OGZhYWQ2OGJjN2VlYmYwMzc5">“I don’t know!” Serena stopped her hands from grabbing her horns. “It’s all… foggy. It vanishes from my mind as soon as I wake. It feels different from the previous times. Has the ship said anything to you?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNTA2MmVmNTY2NTQ1Y2JhZjFmY2EyZmE0ZWVhN2I1">“... No, Captain, although…” Anathor paused for a moment, “It has been more… active recently. Ever since Miss Thornheart cast that wonderful healing spell.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDA4YjcyNzJiZjRhNjRhYjVmMDc3MGQ2YWU5OWM5">“Me?” Amelia questioned. “Did I heal the ship?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjE5MGFiNWY3YTRhMzZhZDY0MjJhNGQzMjdjYjM5">“I do not know, little one,” Anathor replied. “There is a chance… some of your magic soaked into the fourth deck. It may explain some of the things I have been sensing. Have any of you been hearing… music at all?”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmQyZWYwNjQ4MDQ0YzRiMmVlZGVhYTQzNzkyNzA4">“Music?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MzRhZmVhOGU1MDRkYTdhZGU3MjJhMjNkNGY3MzQx">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMDI5MzFhNmNhMjRhMzNiOTIwZTI1ODBhYzY2YTk1">“There was music in my dream. Someone singing… I think,” Serena said, re-reading her notes. “I can’t remember anything else! Are you hearing music, Anathor? Amelia?” The girl shook her head.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzI0NDg5NzFlMjQ0NzliY2IzZWM2OWIxYzRjODlk">“Sometimes…” Came the gruff voice.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzFjNWUyYzBiMTRhZGFiODlkOWM5MDM4NzhmNDE5">“Is it something that’s a concern for us?” Serena eyed the moose.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDMxNmU3Mjc4ODQ4M2I4NGVjNGY2NjY0ODBlMzVh">“... No. Only echoes of the past. If Miss Thornheart could avoid casting that spell again unless absolutely needed… if it happens too many times, we could be in violation of the agreement.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ODE0Y2FlZjYwODQ0MWY4YjE1N2YwZjgxZjc2Mjc4">Serena rubbed her eyes. She would need to ruminate on this later. “How far from Kenhoro, Anathor?”</p>
<p class="cnMyOWE1NzE0MWJkZDQ4MzJiOWQzYTUyYzgxMjNlNjFh">“Two hours, Captain. Mainland will be within visual range soon.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNjM1YTA2YTA3YTQ1YTZhMDllOGY4NGI2MmQzN2Iz">“Are we still being escorted?”</p>
<p class="cnMzM2EzMzY5ZTAwNzQzY2NiMDgyZDkwOWY5OTQxYjg5">“Yes, Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ODFkOWNkZGJjNDQxZWRiZGQ5MDM3NjUzMDgxNjIz">“Before any of that…” Amelia put the plate of sardis in front of her, and its delicious smell finally reached her nostrils. “Eat before it gets cold!” the healer exclaimed with a smile.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjcyYTNlMGY4YzQyZjI5MDkyZjg5YTdkYTVkNGEx">“You got us breakfast?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NGJlNjU5MWY5ODQ5MmZiMzE3MDY1YTM4ZjI0NTNi">“I got <em>you</em> breakfast. I wanted to eat together, but couldn’t resist! I had my share on the way back! The head cook gave me a little extra. So…” Amelia shuffled on her feet, looking everywhere but at Serena.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzUwZDNhNDVjMjQzM2ZhNjVlNGRiMzMxMTBlYzBh">“So…?” Serena mimicked, placing the first piece of sardis in her mouth. Seven hells, it was even better than yesterday! She could immediately feel her mood improving and the stress of the nightmare fall away.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWFjN2NlZjVlNDRjYjM4ZDZjODZmZWM3YjA1NGEy">“So what’s the plan, with me?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjJiMmIzMjNhNTRlNmE4YTEyNDZjNWNjODllMjEy">Serena swallowed. “Since you’re up, head to Tome’s quarters. He’s got something to give you. There’s not enough time for a lesson on your letters, but he can give you some more information about Kenhoro, so you don’t do anything completely stupid.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZmQwYmRkOGY0YzQxZDg5YzEyZDI4MDdhY2FkNGMw">“You’re not going to keep me trapped on the ship!?” The girl raised both hands in the air. “Thank you!”</p>
<p class="cnM4MWZiOWQzMGRhYjRmYzc5ZWY2ZDk5OWNhYzliYjlh">“You thought I would keep you locked up in here?” Serena asked, seeing Amelia nod in response. “When we make land, we will all be finding quarters in Kenhoro. Only the engineers need to stay close, as they’ll be making use of the dock’s cranes to repair the ship properly, as well as install a new turret. They’ll be working day and night, so the noise from the steam grinders and rivet guns will prevent anyone from sleeping.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWJlYzhiMzkxYTQzYmRiMzhiNjBjMTg2ZjFjZjc1">“Some crew members have family homes they can stay at. Most will stay in the barracks. I don’t think putting you in a barracks and mixing with other crews is a good idea, so we’ll be renting a place.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTA2NmEzNDlmMjQ0MDk5OWIyZTJhYjQzOWEyZWFi">“We?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMjM3YjJmYzhkNDQ5MGQ4MDFlOGMwZDQ3YjY0N2Rk">“Yes, we,” Serena said, not missing the sparkle in Amelia’s eyes and the grin she failed to hide. “I’m keeping you close until you understand a bit more about how things work. After a week or two of supervision, I don’t see why you can’t be left to wander about the city and surroundings yourself. I can’t keep you chained to me forever, can I?”</p>
<p class="cnNiOTJjZjc4Nzc5ZDRmMWJiMGRlZWFhM2Y4MThhZjA3">“I suppose… not.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MWQzMTdhZThkNTRmNGRhODA0MmZkYTk2OWYzMzUw">“There are some hotels I’ve stayed in before. One is owned by a family friend, so we’ll try there first.”</p>
<p class="cnM5M2ZlMGIyNmVmODRmNThhYjU4YzJjNWNjZjI1Yjdm">“Okay!” Amelia gave a characteristic thumbs up. “I’ll head to Tome’s then… but before that… can you give me your hand?” Amelia reached out her hand, palm facing upwards. Serena narrowed her eyes. What was she up to now?</p>
<p class="cnM4MjZjNTc5ODI4MzQwZDg5NDI1YjRlZWE2NDU0YTFk">“Why?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MzU2ODhlY2FjNzRiOWZiZDliZGZjOTcxNmNhM2M1">“So I can heal you! You had a nightmare, right?”</p>
<p class="cnMxNmZiMjlmZTU4YjRjY2I5NDA0ZDU0MjBhMjFjOTdj">“... I don’t need healing.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MGFkYzE3YTc0NjRhZWY4OGZjYmQzMmFkMzI1NmFi">“Well, I need the practice. Please?” Amelia wobbled her hand, inviting Serena to grasp it. Serena sighed and then accepted the request. Their hands clenched together, and for a few seconds, nothing happened.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjM1YzI5ZWJkMjQ0YzBhYjM4YmE0N2QwNjA2N2M1">“Well?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWM1OWM5NzI5ODRiZDk5NDJlZmEwNzNmNjE3NDE2">“Ah, sorry! Here I go!” Golden light with blue flecks flowed down Amelia’s arm into Serenas' body. She felt the familiar warmth of a comfortable hug across her entire self. Her mind settled, her emotions stabilized, and she felt fully awake, despite not having her morning coffee.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGE4ODlmYWU0MjRiOWM4Y2YwODBkMzE1ODViMTFh">“Thanks. That… helped,” she said. Amelia’s magic was really something. She felt full of life. The healer flashed a triumphant smile.</p>
<p class="cnNiNGVmZDQzZGZhOTQyY2VhMjg3N2MwNzAyMzViNzMy">“No problem! Can I do this every morning? It helps me practice and would help you… start the day?” Amelia’s eyes took on a pleading look, and once again, a memory of the wolf pup she had raised as a young girl came to mind.</p>
<p class="cnM3M2M0OTk2OGQxZDQzMDVhMTFhZWVjZGU1Yzc4OTI2">“... Fine.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNzM5NmI0MTg3OTQzYzRiOTBiMzg1MDhhMzIyMTFi">“Thanks!”</p>
<p class="cnM4YzNiZmM0OGMzMDRlNTE4OGMzYjc5OGUzMmYyOWY3">“... You can let go now,” Serena said, eyeing their joined hands, which was now becoming awkward.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDQyYWFlODBiZDQzMTZiZjVlNzg2YzAwODY5NWRi">“Can I also put a ward on you? For protection?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmQzYzM5YzJjODQ2ZWM4YmY1ZjBhNTVhNTA3NDA4">“You can do that? Maintain it from a distance?” Maintaining wards on her own body was impressive enough, but for Amelia to do that to another person was a whole other level of capability. It was like a warrior maintaining an aura on a weapon that wasn’t in their hands.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2NlMTcxOTkzODQzOTU4ZTMwZGU4ZmZjZDliNDNh">Although given what she suspected Amelia to be capable of, it wasn’t that surprising.</p>
<p class="cnM3MGM4Mjk0Y2E0OTRiMGY4YzNmYjAzOWRkMDBjYWE3">“I think so… I’ll have to see. Can I try?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDU2YWU4M2JiMTRiZDBhMTRhYTA2MjNlZjc3OGVl">“Which ward?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZWFlYTZlYzkzNDQ2NTdhN2NlNjkyMTQwNTUxMjAz">“The <em>Ward of Thew</em>. It gives a general boost to all your… uh… to your capabilities. Makes you a bit stronger and gives you an all-round defence against physical attacks. It should stack well with your own aura.”</p><span class="cjM2NzNiOTAxMWE1MTQ0Yzc4NGQ5MTk4YzA1ZDdhMjU1"><br/>Stolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjMzg5MTZkMmZiODRhMzZiNjQzNGE5NTU5NGE2ODI0">“First-circle, right?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMzJkZTE4NTIyNDQ5NDdhOWY4ZjQ0OWJmYjRkMTcw">“Yeah, I want to start with something small first. See how my aether reserves handle it,” Amelia explained. Serena thought about chastising her for referring to an <em>Aseco</em> ward as <em>something</em> <em>small</em> but decided against it. They had been holding hands for nearly a minute now, and Serena didn’t want to drag it out any longer.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzNlYTdkOThiOTRkNzZiNThlMGJlOTdjNGU0Mjg3">It would be awkward if her hand started to sweat.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzdlZmY4MzJjZDRmMmY4YWFmOTU1ZDQ1NjE5NThm">“Alright, try it.”</p>
<p class="cnNlZTcwMDMyY2NkMTRlYTc5NjkyYzgxNGEyZTcxN2U5">“Okay! One moment!” Amelia’s eyes focused on nothing, and Serena sensed the spell forming within her. The aether frothed and turned as it got ready to be expressed by its master’s intention. “First circle. <em>Ward of Thew,</em>” Amelia chanted, and Serena’s body began immediately glowing with golden light.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2ZhMzdiNDkxODRmODM5NDg4Mjk0N2Y1YWViOTU2">She clenched her free hand and then, removing her other hand from Amelia’s, clenched that one as well. She was definitely stronger. She knew her capabilities very well. This was at least a quarter increase for sure, maybe more. Unbelievable.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTE0NGMzYWE5NDRlMTZiNWQxNTgyNWZmZjNiMWE4"><em>Something small</em>, apparently.</p>
<p class="cnM4NDcyMjA2YTFkNTQ1YTc5ZjM1NzAxODQyNzE4NmJl">“How’s your aether holding up?” She asked Amelia, who was grinning at her wildly.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTZiYmVjZmZmODQzYWJiMWNkNzg3OGQyMTVmMmZh">“It’s good! I want to see how it changes with distance!” Amelia bounced to the far side of the room and then back. “Doesn’t seem to be any difference. How does it feel?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNGExMTY0YTEwZDRhYWNiZjkwOGMxZmU3NmQzMzZl">“Great. I never imagined I would be touched by the <em>Aseco’s</em> grace of gold. It’s incredible, to be honest.” Thankfully, the only witnesses to this were Anathor and both of them. If it got out that a demon had been warded by <em>Aseco</em> spellwork, it would cause a diplomatic incident between Cascadia and the Federation. “I can’t exactly walk around glowing, though, can I? Best to cancel it for now.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NTQ5ZTMwODhjMTRjZmE5NjNlNGZmOGJhNTAwMDg4">“Not just yet! Let me try something else! Hand!” Amelia reached out to Serena, who accepted the request once again. Amelia closed her eyes for a moment, and the aether inside her tumbled and boiled before suddenly settling down. “No, not like that…” Amelia mumbled, and the aether again became frantic. “Like that!” Amelia said, opening her eyes which were shining blue. “Third circle. <em>Cloak of Secrecy</em>,” the healer said, and immediately, the golden glow dimmed to almost nothing.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTc4ZWNlNzAyMjQ1YzI5ODNmYjM5YjkzNjg1MGJi">Serena resisted an urge to swallow. Did this idiot just <em>cloak</em> an externally cast ward? She had never heard of that happening. Was it even possible? Apparently so.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDc5ZWZmZDU1YzRkN2M5MmQ5Yjk1MzA2ZjczNzQy">“Have you… ever done this before?”</p>
<p class="cnMxOWUyMjQzNjg4MDRmMmFiNmU4YWRjZGFjNmNmOGMz">“Yes! Although not in this… you know.” Amelia trailed off, smart enough not to keep vocalising the reality of her soul and body, regardless of where they were.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTI3ODU1Y2FmNjQ3NDE4N2JlYWU1YjFiM2YzNjg5">Serena released her hand from Amelia’s once again and focused inwards. She could feel the ward still, a subtle shimmer, like her aura. They were laced together, forming something far stronger than what they could do alone. Serena stood up and walked around the quarters, adjusting her body to the change. “How’s the aether now?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnNiZmVkZjAxYzRhYTQ2MzVhZDhkMThiNzFjZjhjYWZh">“Still good. I’ll cancel it from a distance if it ever becomes a problem, but for now, I’d like to keep it going,” Amelia shrugged, suddenly looking shy. “After what happened at the port… I’d feel a lot better if I could protect you in some way.” Serena stopped, noting the girl had begun to blush a little.</p>
<p class="cnMwZTk5NzBkYzg1ZjRmMTZhYzRkYmJmOTQ2NTc5MWIz">This idiot kept doing things that were making her heartbeat kick into gear.</p>
<p class="cnNjM2JhOTMxNzFlNTRiY2ViNGRjMWFlMDU2MzBjMjNj">Serena resisted a sigh. From the dream she had just experienced, it was possible that the ship was requesting that she protect Amelia. If that was true, then she wasn’t sure what she was supposed to do! The one who was supposed to be under her protection was protecting her!</p>
<p class="cnM5YjFjNzMxMTk1YjRjMDc4ZjU4ZGI5YjRlMjVmYTIz">“I see. Let me know if it becomes a problem. Don’t hesitate to cancel it if you need the aether, especially when we’re separated over greater distances in the city.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MjZjM2VhMWE0NTQyMzE5OWUwMDNmNGY3YzRmODA5">“Mmm! I’ll keep it in mind!”</p>
<p class="cnNhNDM4N2NmNjM5MTRmNGE5N2FjOWMzZGEyNjZjYmIx">“Good,” Serena collected her thoughts. “I need to wash up, then head to the bridge, make sure the docking goes alright,” She pointed a finger at Amelia, “You head to Tome’s now, alright?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjQ4YzNkZTBiZjQzM2Y5ZjFmMjc5MTFmMmQ5ZjBk">“Okay!” Amelia bounced to the door, poised to open it. “One more thing!”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDZkZjNjNTQ2OTQ4M2Q4OTE5MDJlMTJmNDMwYWI1">“What is it now…?”</p>
<p class="cnM4YzBjZDBlYWVmYjQ2MjJhYTMwMDliZjZlNTFjYjZj">Amelia gave her a cheeky grin. “If you keep snoring during the night, I’m going to kick you in your sleep!” She flung the door open and vanished before Serena could respond.</p>
<p class="cnM5NWJmMDIxY2Q0NzQxYWVhMDA1ZjZkODZjNmVlZTE2">Tsk! What an idiot she was!</p>
<p class="cnMyNGRiNzJhNzQ4NTQ2ZGQ4MzljM2E3NjQ0ZTVhNDVm">Amelia was the one who snored!</p>
<p class="cnMwMWZmODM2M2Y1ZTRhNzdiYzE4NGYyZGI3N2QyNzcw"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMGNiZGM5NmQ0OTRhODliYWY3YTdiYmU2ZmY1ZjY1"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNlNDM3ZDAyM2UwMjRmN2I5MjM5Yjg4ZjFhZDQ0YWUy">“Captain on deck!” Dagon called out, and everyone on the bridge scrambled to attention.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzBiYTliMTgwMjQwOGU5MWJhNzU2MTg1NmY2ZDlj">“At ease,” Serena said, waving a hand as everyone returned to what work they had. The core officers were present, apart from the chief engineer who had left his second in command here. The rest of the subordinates were running at half-staff as the bridge didn’t need so many hands on deck when it was just cruising.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjc1ZGI5MGE1YjQxNmJhMjAxYTE0MGQ0YjJkYTU1">“Navigation?” She asked, not barking the order. It was early in the morning, and she was in a good mood after being healed.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDdmZDZjNGFkMzQwMzQ5Mzg0Y2ViNmJhZjY3NzQ0">“Twenty knots! Bearing two hundred and ten degrees from the north! Seven thousand meters!” The navigation officer read out from the pitot-static instrument. “Mainland should be visible any moment now!”</p>
<p class="cnM1MjFkNDBkYmM3YjQ2ZDc4NTczNmMyOTljMmIxZWE0">Any moment turned out to only be a few seconds. “Mainland visible!” The sensors officer called out. Serena peered through the bridge windows, just about making out the distant mountain tops. A swell of cheers and applause broke out in the bridge room. They were home again, having survived yet another battle.</p>
<p class="cnM4NGU3ZjVkZTg5NjQ3ZWViNTllNDkyYjMxYjRkYmVl">Unfortunately for Serena, over the next few months, she knew she would be fighting a number of very different battles.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjQ5YjU3ZmI0NTQ1NDBiOTI2NjM4MGQ2Njc1ODEy">“First Officer, when did we switch the propulsion engine on?” Serena had noticed the distinctive hum of the engine as she had made her way to the bridge.</p>
<p class="cnNhOWYxMzZmMmU1MTQ2YjM5ZTA2ZTc3YWFiNjZjY2U0">“About half three in the morning,” Dagon responded, “Trade winds died down."</p>
<p class="cnNkMzJjN2FkZjgyNTQwNjhiZWUyMzI2ZWJiZjk2NDc0">“They normally carry us all the way.”</p>
<p class="cnNmODU0OTI1NjQxMjQ5Nzk4NTIwOTFjOGQ5NTY0NzIx">“It’s about time of the year the eastern sky-rift starts throwing out storms. Likely caused a knock-on effect.” Serena nodded to that. Soon, light merchant travel in the eastern skies would shut down as storm season ravaged the space. The <em>Vengeance</em> could push through a storm if it needed to. It was heavy enough, unlike the lighter merchant ships that ran the route between the Eastern Terra Firma and the Sabanis Dominance in the north.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2ZmMmNmMzcyOTQ1MzY5MzFiMWMwZTYxODlkMzUy">“Have our new friends given us any trouble?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MWExNTg1ODNjNDQ2NDk4NjllMTEwZDBhYjhlODNl">“No, Captain. They seem content on just observing. We had them send us a list to see what the Kenhoro stockpiles are looking like.” Dagon waved over Thorne, the weapons officer.</p>
<p class="cnM2MGQxZGQ3MWUwYjQ2MGY5OGE3ZTk0MDVmNWQ2Njk0">“Bled bone dry, Captain,” Thorne said, “Looks like the fleet took spares of everything and then spares for the spares. The only silver lining is there’s a logistic convoy from Ponan en route, which is due next week.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNWI2MGM2N2QwZTQyOTFhOGE2NWQ1YTZhYmFlZTg2">“Do they at least have the girders and armour plating we need for repairs?” Serena asked. Delaying the turret replacement wasn’t the end of the world. They didn’t seem due for a combat mission for a while, courtesy of the Dragon and potentially her father’s influence. However, fixing up the armour was a priority. Those steel plates they had patched the hole with looked impressive from the outside, but the half-inch metal wouldn’t stand up to much shellfire.</p>
<p class="cnM2NWExNjEzMDMzOTRiNDVhYjM3MGIyNWRiYWU5MjJj">If she thought about it, with the <em>Ward of Thew</em> running, she could potentially punch through one as she was now without channelling any higher auras or Speaking. She would have to test that later.</p>
<p class="cnM5YmVmNDU0OThjNDQyMTE5ZDlmYjAzMTllM2Q4YzBi">“They do on the list, but you know how things are… the list never matches what’s actually there. Things get moved, paperwork dropped… underhanded deals… you name it.” Thorne shrugged.</p>
<p class="cnNlNWU1NDc4MDQ5MzQ4YzY5MWEwNTVhZjllYzJiNTE5">Serena clicked her tongue in annoyance. “If it comes to it, we’ll pull military law and source some from the civilian industry. We’ll wait till the Ponan shipment arrives first. We don’t want to upset the locals unless we have to.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNjE4ZWE3NGEwMzQzNmE5MmMzYTQ4OGUzMDM4MGIz">“Aye, Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMGRlM2UzYjEwOTRmMWFhNGQyYTkyMTJmNjYxMjY4">“Let’s begin our approach. Helmsman, pitch down. Three degrees.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTYzODc1NWIzMTRjMjg5YWJlM2Y2YzQyOGMxMTc2">“Pitching down! Three degrees!” The reply from the helmsman came as he operated one of the levers next to him.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzlkMTVlYzZjMjRhNjA5YmYyMmE3YWI3MGQ2NDUw">“Pitch down! Three degrees!” The engineer on duty yelled into the speaking tube. She was one of the only other women on board, and her feminine voice, although a little coarse, stood out in the bridge mostly full of men. She was Allston the chief engineer’s niece. Serena had once challenged the man on whether her position wasn’t an act of nepotism, and the man had shrugged and told her, ‘<em>She’s a damn better engineer than I am’</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjBlNDE5N2RhMjQ5MTJiODdkZjU4Y2Q3MzFiNWUz">Through the bridge windows, the mainland was now clearly visible. The Cascadian continent floated in the sky at the height of almost four thousand meters, and from their current height, the mountain tops - where the population centers were located - could be seen. A few minutes later, the green of the great forest that carpeted the majority of the Empire could be made out. As more of the continent became visible, the mood on the bridge improved.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjVjOTI1ZTUwZTQyNGM4OWEzOTNlNzFlMGI1NjMy">“First Officer.”</p>
<p class="cnMwY2Q1NmE0OTA1NDRkYmNiMGI5NGJkZGM0MDU4MTI0">“Yes, Captain?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NTU2NWRkNmZkMTRmYTg5ZTVjODFmODFiZjQ2YTYy">“Before we let the crew out into the city, make sure they know not to be too forthcoming about Amelia.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NzMzNzE3MTMwNzQ1ZDY5ODIyZTFjYWZmMDAyNjgw">“Aye, Captain. But… the men will drink, and drink makes men talk…”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjI0ODJkZTU3NzQ5ZTFhMjYwYWY2YmI3YzRiYjBj">“Yes, I simply wanted to try to minimize information spread where we can. Make sure to highlight very strongly the military consequences with regards to accepting bribes for information about this ship or anyone upon it.” She gave Dagon a hard stare. This was important, and she would flog or hang those who became too greedy or easily swayed while on land leave.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjIxOTg4NmMzMTRlZjRhYmFiYTc2Y2ZlODViZTBh">“... Aye, Captain,” Dagon responded.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzkyZGFiZGI5NzRkNGZhZWZmYmU1OTJmZmUyOTYx">With that dealt with, Serena turned away and occupied her mind with thoughts about all the events that had transpired over the last week. She thought about the crew. She thought about Korvus. She thought about her dreams and the ship.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTVhNjk2OTVhZTQ3YTQ4YTlkMjkxY2RhNjlmZWU1">Most of all, she thought about Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTFkYWVhYTQ4ZTRkZDU5ZDE0MjFhMTdiZmRjZGJj"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NjNmMjAxZGJmMjQ2ODBhYjAwYTZlMGM5OTEwMjU3"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM4NmQwZDUxYWMxOTQzM2NiMjU3MGIwNGNjMmM1N2Iz">“Hang on, why are <em>all</em> of the major cities on mountains? Doesn’t it make farming difficult?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2JhNjc0NjUxMTRhOWY4YmU1ODUxNjJkN2Q2Yjdm">“Did the captain not go over this with you?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMDBkZDdhZjY3NjRkMjFhNzZkODViNzA3YWEyNmJi">“Not really, she said you would give me a history lesson.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjdmZWU5MTIyNjQ1NGM4Njc2ZTg3MjkxODExYTIy">Amelia was sitting in Tome’s quarters, which were the epitome of organization. She couldn’t yet read the numerous labels that were attached to everything, but she could see there was some highly complex system of colour-coding that Tomes had applied to the room.</p>
<p class="cnMzOGI5NDY5MGNmNDQwYjBhOTE1YTZiYjdkOTA5NmU2">Tomes had been giving her the rundown on Kenhoro. Being close to the front line and to a country called the Sabanis Dominance, it had a constant stream of demon and human travellers and merchants. Apparently, about one in five of the population was human, and there were even human-majority districts in some parts of the city.</p>
<p class="cnNlZGQxYTRjZmY4NjQzOGZiNmFhZjIwNDE2NzA5YWNj">She interrupted him, however, as he made an offhand comment about how the entire city was located in <em>the mountains like all the others</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTlkMmVhNWFkZjRmMTViOWM5YmUyNjk0ZWYzNzNk">“I see. I guess I should start at the beginning.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMzZhODFlMmVjZDQ0OGQ4Mzc1NWIzMzNkZWM4YTMz">“Yes, please!”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTNkM2ZmYjIwZTRmMjY5NmE5MzYxZDZlNWZiMDFm">“One thousand years ago, many-”</p>
<p class="cnNiN2M4Zjc1Y2M4MzQ4MzI5ZjI2Mzc4OWM1OWM5OTk0">“Wow, when you say at the beginning you really mean it, huh?” Amelia couldn’t stop her outburst and felt herself be crushed under Tome’s glare. “Sorry…” she muttered.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzg4MmI5NGRmNTRjYWI5Yjg1YTI1M2Y1ZDlmNDBh">“One thousand years ago,” Tomes continued, intentionally pausing, daring her to interrupt again. “One thousand years ago, many nations - both demon and human - inhabited the Cascadia continent. Back then, there were no airships. No firearms. No steel. The Words were unknown to us. Everyone lived on the ground, prospered, fought wars and got on with life. Cascadia saw it all, floating in the sky as it always had done… and then!” Tomes flourished with hands, bringing his two fists together. “A collision!”</p>
<p class="cnNjZWVkZWU1YTU4YTQ2MGNhM2VjNmJmNmQ2NjgxN2Nl">Amelia felt her eyes go wide. She had to admit the man had a talent for storytelling. She felt like a kid being told stories by a grandfather.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWU4YmZiMGJmMzQ5OTg4NzIzOWRkMWM2YWNhNmIw">“Our continent collided with unknown dark lands in the far north, and from these treacherous lands came legions of black beasts! Titanic creatures that sought to destroy all life!” Tomes threw his hands dramatically in the air. He was definitely enjoying himself.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2MyZDhjYWQwMTQ1M2VhZDE5MjUzZDY0MzgzNzk4">“Oh my!” Amelia exclaimed.</p>
<p class="cnMzZTgxOWViOWMxNjQ5ZjViZTI0NzgxM2ZhODdlMWZi">“They were led by the chaos god known as <em>Anathema</em>, although most people refer to it as the <em>Malignant Darkness</em>.” Tomes raised a finger to his lips. “Don’t say the first name out loud, it brings bad luck!” Amelia nodded frantically.</p>
<p class="cnMwOGU0NDU0MTIzYTRlMmM5MWRlYTQ2MTZmOTVmNjMx">“They butchered their way across the continent in a century-long invasion we call <em>The Long Discordancy</em>. Outmatched and facing extinction, humans and demonkind fled to the mountaintops and plateaus, where we built our fractured civilization on higher ground. The invaders spread with them an inhospitable wilderness, the ancestor to the great forest that blankets the world even today!</p>
<p class="cnNiOTY1NDhkY2NjMjRjYWE4MjkxMmUyODk0MjJmMGU0">“And it was in one of these desperate small plateau kingdoms,” Tomes continued, raising a finger, “That a young woman was born, a talented mage that led her subordinates to battle against the enemy forces. Her hellfire spells burned the black legions to ash, and bit by bit, they began to win!</p>
<p class="cnMxYjM1NTk2MWFlYTRlMGY4MTQ2ZGQ1NDAyMzdjMDk2">“Only then did the avatar of the enemy appear. He was far stronger than anything that had come before! Hellfire tickled his skin, and swords broke upon him! The young mage battled him for seven days and seven nights, but she was not strong enough! It was then, when all seemed lost, all her subordinates lying dead around her, that the future Empress communed the First Word and Spoke for the very first time!”</p>
<p class="cnNiOTEzOWYyZWE0NDQ5ZTZhMTYxNjA4ZDM2NjYwOWQx">“What then!?” Amelia had drawn her knees up, lost in the story. She could see it now in her mind, a beautiful demon - who looked just like Serena - in shining armour conquering a great evil!</p>
<p class="cnNhNDFhN2I1ZDczZDRiNmU5NzAwZDYwZmQzYjdkMTI2">“Then, Elana took her place on what would later be called the <em>True Throne</em>, fashioned out of the skeleton of the avatar himself, and began the long process of expelling the invaders from the continent, gathering all to her cause. This <em>reconquista</em> took eighty years, and during this time, Elana communed the Second Word! The wilderness was pacified, and the most dangerous beasts were slaughtered. Some descendant species remain even today if you go deep enough.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzU0NzdlOWMxYTQ1YWM4OTBiNTUyZWUxZmJhNTk0">“Once the enemy had been forced back to their home continent to lick their wounds, Elana - who was only a queen then - knew it would only be a matter of time before they communed their own Words. So she marched to the point of collision and prayed to the higher gods for seven years! Eventually, her faith reached a great god of hellfire, who communed the Third Word with Elana, and when she Spoke it, the enemy land was driven from our sky, never to be seen again!”</p>
<p class="cnMxM2Y0YTg4NDE4YTRiODZhMTdmYjY2MzAyOWUxMTJl">Tomes took a much-needed breath. “Then, returning home, she was content in ruling as a benevolent queen. However, the kingdoms began to fall back into their own ways, fighting over land and religion. She knew they had to be united should the enemy ever return. Therefore over the next century, Queen Elana unified much of the continent and formed the Empire of Cascadia and became Empress! That was a bit over eight hundred years ago, and we have prospered ever since under her rule! The end!”</p>
<p class="cnNlNjI0N2Y5NjZmYjQ1MmJiOGQ4ZmNiMzc5NTE2N2Q3">Amelia clapped enthusiastically. “That was a great story, uh, not a story. A great telling of history! Thanks, Tomes! You did kinda skip over the last eight hundred years, though…”</p>
<p class="cnM2MWRhOGVjMTFmNDRmMzY4NWE2MjFhMzI4NzQ0MzFl">“Hmm…” Tomes said, scratching his jaw. “I remembered halfway through I have two hundred crew payments I need to document and balance, so I skipped the latter chunk. Some of the books on the captain’s shelves are history books, so you can dig deeper when you learn to read Imperial.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MjY2OTQwNjYwMTRkZTk4YTY0ZTRkNDg4ZDYzYzI2">“Oh, okay! Well, it explains why all the major cities are in the mountains. Do many people live on the ground?”</p>
<p class="cnMwY2VkZmFjYjM2MDQ5YmY4YWJhYWE3Y2E5YjNkMmIy">“Yes, as populations grew and the need for more fertile farmland became urgent, more effort was put into clearing more forest. As of today, every major city has significant ground around it that is cleared for farming. Numerous small towns and villages have popped up there as well. Practically the entire Centralis basin is cleared of forest and has been for a while now.”</p>
<p class="cnNlZjUzMjJmOWNhZDRjZGU5MjhlMzgxOWFmYmY5MGY3">“I see! I can’t wait to see Kenhoro!” Amelia was itching to walk on land. The time in Port Highwind had been so short, and then she had been stuck onboard for a week! She was definitely getting claustrophobic.</p>
<p class="cnM1OGViMjc2NGI0MzQwYmM4ZTgwZDYzNjI5OGJjZTY0">“That reminds me, take this.” Tomes fished out something from his person. “Captain gave this to me. It’s a symbol of her house, the <em>Halen House</em>. There’s a good chance you’ll be stopped at random times and asked about who you are and what you’re doing. Showing them this should clear things up.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYjNmNGZjZWZiMDRhNWZhNTlkOTJiM2RiZWIwNjc0">He handed her the dark metal piece, which had a silver carving of a wolf attached. “Take this and wear it around your neck.” He gave her a piece of string, which she threaded through a hole in the metal and tied it to form a makeshift necklace.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDlmYjI1Zjc0MzQwODRiYjBiZjI3YzA4NzBlYjk3">She would definitely treasure this for the rest of her life!</p>
<p class="cnMwNGJlYzMyYzMzNzRlZmRhZDlmNGUwOTAzODljMWZh">“Myself, Dagon or the captain will be with you at all times during the first week so that you find your feet in the city. We can give you an advance on your first month's payment, so you have some money to spend. Any questions?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMTI1MGQ0ZTQ2ZDRiMTFiNGEyMmIxYmQwN2E5OTEw">Amelia shook her head. “Nothing comes to mind!”</p>
<p class="cnM5YzBmOTQ1MzcxMjRiZDM5MWU1NDhiMDE3ZWI3ZTZl">“Right. I have some work to do. We don’t have time to start on letters properly, but we’ll go over the numbers. Look here: This is the Imperial script for number <em>one</em>….” Tomes wrote down all the numbers from one to twenty and told her to go practice in silence.</p>
<p class="cnMyN2UxNjQwZWVlNzQ0ZGFhNjJlYjA3NmI5Y2ZkMzhh">Amelia obeyed, happy to finally learn some Imperial. It seemed to be in base ten, but the numbers from ten to twenty had their own special symbol. After that, things seemed to flow in the same manner as they did in her old world. She lost herself in the task, and before she knew it, she was filling out the fifth page.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzZjMGFjMTEzMTQ0N2NiYTRjMjlmNWU0MGY2ZjM2">“We’re landing,” Tomes said, barely looking up.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDcxN2NjNWRlYjRkMWVhODg1ZWQwYTRmNjU1YjBl">“We are!? Are we even moving? I can barely feel it!”</p>
<p class="cnM3YWVhODA4MzE4YjQzYjI5YWVjYjc2NGQwOTUyYzk3">“The last part of landing takes the longest. Heavy ships like the <em>Vengeance</em> will spend twenty minutes coming into dock at half a knot or less.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MTcyN2I5N2M3MTRlNjY4NTc0N2MzY2JkZmU0MWZj">“Why so slow?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NjM0YmJlYTBjYzRjOWI4NTFlMmNhNmNmYWRmMWYw">“Because the ship is thousands of tonnes of metal, wood and demon. If that hits the side of a building or a crane at anything above a knot, it’ll plough straight through simply due to inertia. Battleships come in even slower.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NzQxMGYzOGY3ZTQ5NGM4ODcwNmRiYjY1NjM5ZjBl">Amelia squirmed in her seat, her excitement rising. Soon she would be outside! On the mainland!</p>
<p class="cnMzZWU2MjU4M2M1ZjRlOGQ4MWMxNTA2MmJmYWVjZmY1">“Any moment now, we’ll hit the keel blocks, and the shoring arms will attach to the hull to hold it in place…” As Tomes finished, a jolt rippled through the ship's structure. It felt similar to the last moment of a train pulling into a station.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTg5MTRmMDQ4MzQ1MWI5OTNlY2I0YjkxMTliZDM1">Amelia tapped her feet like an excited child.</p>
<p class="cnNiODRiYWI0ZTI0ZTQ4Y2Q4NDJhYTFlOTc3MTZmMmJh">They had arrived in Kenhoro!</p>
<p class="cnM1MmUxYTkwMTQyNTQyOGFhMWM5MjRlNTg2N2QxYTA2"> </p>

      <description>Chapter Fourteen: Kenhoro</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM1MTJlZjZjYzljNDQwNTViZjg1Njk5NjZjMWM1MjVk"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMyZTBmMGQxNzFmYTQ2ZWFiZjBlOGIzYzYzYjY2NTNk">With a hiss of steam and a clunk, the metal gangway came to a stop. A familiar man in a dark blue uniform was waiting for her. A double pair of small horns crowned his head from which an enormous ponytail flowed. From behind a pair of spectacles, sharp green eyes glared at her, a rare trait that suggested the man had ancestry from the far West.</p>
<p class="cnM1M2M2NDFlNjJlZjQ0NTdiZjFlM2ViN2I5NWMzMDM2">“Dockmaster Yu. Always a pleasure to see you well,” Serena said smoothly with a smile. She had come to appreciate Shin Yu, the dockmaster of Kenhoro.</p>
<p class="cnNiNTVmNmEwODQxODQxODA4MWYwMjhmMjllNzdjOTdh">“You!” He pointed a finger at her. “Get <em>that ship</em> out of my docks! Go somewhere else! Why come to Kenhoro, huh!?” Shin waved to the east. “The Tanhae docks are over there! Yes, hello!? I can hear them now! They want you to go over there! Shoo! Bye bye!” He motioned with his hands frantically.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTM3NTZlZDAzODRjZjI5ZTJlMWJhZTVhZTAwZGZk">Shin Yu spoke Imperial with a thick accent, and much of his native Manwese tone slipped through. He was unbelievably direct when speaking Imperial, lacking the full vocabulary to be more tactful. Not that anyone would criticise him for it. No captain would dare get on the bad side of the dockmaster.</p>
<p class="cnNmMmRkMGZlMTJjMDRkNTY4ZjIzZDY0YzI2YmU5NTk4">“Come now, we’ll be out of your horns before you know it. A bit of work on the hull, and we’ll vanish like the wind.” Serena flashed her most charismatic smile.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTIwNzhhNTcyNjRjMmFhNTdkN2UwZTk2M2E2NGQ5">“That ship! Bad luck!” He was wagging his finger at her now. Shin Yu enjoyed expressing himself with his hands. “You! Bad luck!” Serena pondered how she could placate the excitable dockmaster when a pair of figures approached from the side.</p>
<p class="cnNiODA1NjQ0ZDhjMzQ0MThhNGUwODBiZGRlYmE2YjEz">“Just the man I need!” Allston, the chief engineer, appeared flanked by his niece. “We need two overhead cranes, thirty meters of two by one girder, eighty meters of half by half. Good man, how many armour plates do you have lying about?” Allston put an arm around the dockmaster and practically dragged him away, ignorant of the noises of protest coming out of the man. His niece rolled her eyes and gave Serena a knowing look before following after them.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjQzNmQ1ZjU5MTQ3NTliZjZkNzlkMGU0OTRkMjlm">Well, that was one problem that was dealt with. Those two would talk over each other for hours. She turned and shouted back up the gangway, “Dagon! Start letting the crew off!” After she heard the affirmative reply, she made her way to the requisition office, where she found a demon lazing around behind a windowed desk reading the broadsheets.</p>
<p class="cnNmYWVlNDkyODFjODQxMTk5OWE1OWQ2NjJlZWQxNzI0">The man did a double take, eyes widening in recognition and surprise. “Speaker Halen! It’s an honour!” He scrambled to his feet and gave her a hasty salute.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGI1MzFlYTJhYTQ1ODFhZTQxZjAzMTY3YTY5ZTI0">“Turn that around, Officer. Let me have a look,” she said, nodding her head at the broadsheets. The requisition officer obeyed, and Serena read the large block capitals printed across the broadsheet: <em>EASTERN FLEET ADVANCES</em>. The subheading underneath read: <em>ADMIRAL ZHAO EXPLOITS COLLAPSE AFTER KEY LOGISTIC CENTER LIBERATED</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWRiZWNlNzZkNzRiY2I4MGVhNGQ4YzQ4ODA2ODM2">“When was this printed?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzQxYjg3ZTE3NDRmMjk4ZDJjYWExM2QyZGU5ZjJl">“This morning, Speaker Halen!” the officer enthusiastically responded. “They say that it was your doing! They’re saying you might be awarded a silver eagle!”</p>
<p class="cnM1NmUwZGU3NzM2ZDRjZjRiNDU3MDc5MjBkNWYzNGVh">“Who’s saying that?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTE1Y2M5NWQ2NzRmYmY5MDdlMmE5MzBlNjRlZTQw">“It’s all in there, Speaker Halen,” the demon gestured to the broadsheet she was reading. Serena skimmed the contents. She was named, as was the <em>Vengeance</em>. There wasn’t a picture of the <em>Vengeance; </em>the broadsheets were forbidden from publishing a photograph of the ship. Yet a lack of visuals didn’t stop them from building up the ship as an unstoppable vessel undetectable by the enemy.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTIwN2Y2MDA2ODQ5NzY4M2E3MzI5NjhhMTY5MWM2">Reading further, she found the officer was right and the papers reported that Greatlord Feng - master of Kenhoro, Tanhae, and Ponan - had recommended her for the medal. Serena wondered if her father had anything to do with that. He could have leveraged the strategic position the war had put their family in for such a cause. Alternatively, if they were planning to honourably discharge her from the Navy, then the medal would be the method to buy her silence.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTQ3NjBhMThjNDQzZGViYmZhNzBlZTJhNmZjOWFl">“How did the broadsheets find out about this so fast?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDhkZmNjNmU0NTQ0OGE5MGNiMDA0MTMwNGUzODU4">“Admiral Zhao took a media team with him. They docked up in the civilian bays last night.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNGYwZjgxOGZiZDQ2ZDhiYzI4Y2E5MTQ1MzA2Nzc1">That would explain it. If the media arrived at Port Highwind shortly after the fleet did, they would have beaten them back to Kenhoro, especially as her own departure was delayed due to the fighting and the politicking of the Dragon.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTZlYzhmMjU0ZDQxOGRhYWY3ZTQ4NmMxNjg4NTU5">“Right,” Serena said, turning her gaze from the broadsheet and to the officer. “You got any raincoats? One my size and one,” she held her palm up flat in level with her eyebrows, “about this size. Get me a few pairs of boots, size seven through to ten, and the socks for them. Find a couple of rainhats as well.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMDE3NWQzYTVjNTQzYTE5NTQ2ZmI5NmJlMWY2MzI3">The requisition officer scrawled down her request and disappeared into the back. Amelia wasn’t technically wearing a military uniform as they had ripped any identifying parts off, but it was still Republican colours, and she didn’t want to take her out to the city until she was wearing something that wouldn’t draw attention. While mentally mapping out the path they would take in the city, a voice called out to her.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDJhMDE5ZGU1MzQxMmM4ODE4ZWViMWY3ZDc4OTRi">“Lady Halen! Is that you?”</p>
<p class="cnNmODQzOTk4YTRkYTQ2OTg5OTFjZTlmODVhZjFmNDVk">Serena turned towards the goatee-sporting demon with a handsome face. He wore a uniform that was similar to hers, but instead of gold trim, red thread decorated the edges.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDc4MGQzNGQxYjQ5M2I4YmExNzgxNmU3ZTdjMDk5">“Aiden!” she exclaimed in surprise, recognising the man. She corrected herself after noticing the marks on his shoulder. “Officer Adachi? Congratulations… looks like you found your place in Intelligence.” Aiden Adachi stroked his goatee and gave her a grin.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWNlYjUyMDg3NzQ3ZjdhNTRmZWUxOTdiN2ZmYzI2">“Took three attempts but got there in the end! When was the last time we met? At graduation?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YmNjYWZkMTZiNDQ3Y2U4MzRkOTg1MmNmNjFhOWVi">“We saw each other two years later at the shareholder meeting in Asamoto. You were…” Serena couldn’t help but form a smile, “Too far gone to recognise me. You thought I was my sister and tried flirting with me, you bastard.” Aiden’s drinking prowess at the academy was somewhat legendary, and it hadn’t seemed to have died down when they had encountered each other four years ago.</p>
<p class="cnMyZmJhNmRjYTdmNTRlMWU5ZWQ2YTBkNjQ3Nzg4MGQ0">The habitual drunk rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. “My bad, my bad. You know Nina’s name is cropping up more and more in reports? She’s got a team working for her now. Whatever she’s building, they’re throwing coin at it.” Serena nodded. She didn’t know too much about what her sister was working on currently, but whatever that genius was cooking up would no doubt be a significant help to the war effort and the family.</p>
<p class="cnNmNmI1NzU2NWFiYTQ4NTY4MTNlYmY4MDI4YjhjODgy">“We’re all very proud of her…” She trailed off with a cold stare at her old friend, happy to see that she could still make him wither under her glare. “Why are you here, Officer Adachi?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDM4YzY2MzQyZDRkZjI5NDE4ZTQyYTg4ODViOGYy">“They got me doing grunt work, stock takes and the like,” Aiden said, shrugging while looking to the side, “You’d be surprised at just how bad the-”.</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2Q2M2E5NzE1YjQxOTFiZDhlNjc4MmI2MjE5OTIz">“Cut the shit, you’re here for the human right?”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTRkM2JhYzhhMjQwMTc4YTE3ZTUzYzFkMTEzZTg1">“Damn right, I am!” The demon blurted out shamelessly, “Can I meet her!?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YTQzNzc0MGY4NzRjZDY5MmIxOThhOTZlYmI2MTk1">“... for what purpose?”</p>
<p class="cnMwZmVjN2YzNGE2MzQ2ODI4YzVlYjI0M2M4YmNmNzE2">“The big horns want me to do a personality profile on her. That’s it, honest!” Aidens eyes took on a pleading look. “Come on Serena, this is my big opportunity! I’ve been doing logistics for years now, and I’m ready to pull my horns off!”</p>
<p class="cnNhNDRkYmNkN2Y1ZTQ5ODI5N2YzYzFhYmVkODY2OGYz">“What happens if I say no?”</p>
<p class="cnNhODQ5M2Q4MGQ4ZDQ5YTU4ZDI2Mzk5ZDYxZTZmNTBj">“Then… I guess there’s an escalation. You know how far they can go. They want to do things quietly and peacefully out of respect for you and your family. It really is just a profile, please?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMjIwY2QwY2EwMDRlMDg5YmNiMmJlOWJhMWZlZDZm">“Give me a week.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDU2YTg1N2RhZjQyZDlhZDIzYjNlNmFhMDY4ZDNm">“A week?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWU4NjVlNTA0OTQzOTQ4ZDM4ZWQ1ZDg3Y2EzZjg3">“Miss Thornheart is somewhat ignorant of things. I’m teaching her a bit of common sense before letting her… roam. Etiquette as well. We’ll be meeting my father in Shimashina after the repairs are done.”</p>
<p class="cnNiZGE1MGU5MjQ1ZDQ1MTE4YzQ0NjkzYmM1ZTNiNmIz">“How long are you here for?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OGU3ZTBmZWY1ZTQ0Y2M4NzZmODQyZjBkNTFkNzFm">“A month, maybe. No longer than six weeks. Ship's got a big hole that needs filling.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYTExOTFiOWFlYjRiZDFiNTg5MTZlZjhkNjgzOTIz">“Where are you staying?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmE2YzNkNTZjZDQ3YmU4MzQ0MzJjY2FkNDA2Y2Rl">“... at The Highguard, if they have rooms.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNmM4MjZmZGQ4MTRjYTE5OWQ5Y2IzMTAxNjQwOWQ5">“Ah, family friend, right?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNDUzYzBhMTAyODQ5ZWI5ZDI1NDg0NzVhYTQwYTI4">“That’s right.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMzBmNmEwNDBiODRkY2ZiMzIyNjQ3ZTEwYzg2ZTVi">“Well then… In about a week, the moonrain festival will start.” A glint appeared in Aiden’s eyes, and his mouth formed into a knowing grin. “We could go all out then? Show her a good time?”</p>
<p class="cnMzOWQ0YjRmMmYwODRiMTdhNTUyMzYwNjAxMjZjYmFl">“You mean, go out drinking?” Serena sighed. This man never changed. He was an idiot, although a different type of idiot than Amelia was.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTlhMjVlNTFkYzQ1N2Y5MmY5NTFkNjkwMjA0MThi">“They have a street here, half a klick long, you know? I don’t know its Manwese name, but the Imperial translation is <em>Beer Street</em>. Know why? Pubs!” Aiden cast his hands dramatically, “Everywhere! We could do a pub crawl and introduce the human to a proper demon drink! Like we did on those academy weekends.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDYxOTI3Mzg1YjRkMWViZDJlMTg1YjY0NDIwMDgy">“That is a terrible idea.” She shook her head. “We’re not students anymore, Officer Adachi.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMmU4M2Y0ZDJlNjRhMTI4ODZiMzRlNTdhZWM4ZTkx">“But!” Aiden exclaimed, raising a finger. “We are demons. And I’m still on my crusade to find a human that can outdrink Aiden The Drinker!”</p>
<p class="cnMyMmI2OTcyM2VmZjRkOTliNjcxZGY4YzZmNDQyNjk1">“It was Aiden The Drunk, idiot,” she said, smiling at the academy memories popping into her mind. Maybe it wasn’t a completely terrible idea. As a Speaker, it wasn’t like she or Amelia could get drunk easily, and the girl was <em>twenty-five</em>. Serena didn’t want to or planned to treat her like a child. Besides, it <em>could</em> be fun. Perhaps Amelia would like to dance, perhaps-</p>
<p class="cnNmMGQ4OGVjN2FhOTRmMDc4ZDM0MmY3NjE4ZmQ3ZGIz">What in the seven hells was she imagining? Serena mentally slapped herself. What dangerous fantasies were creeping into her mind? She tried to push them away but found she was unable to. The image of her and Amelia dancing together…</p>
<p class="cnNmMTFjNjMzZjlhNjQ4YjY5YjA4MmFmZDAyMWUzYWEw">It was nice.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjY2OTVjYjFjYTQwZGY4OWFiMTFjYjgxMGMwYmFi">Damn it. Who said she couldn’t have a <em>friend</em>? Who said she had to play the stiff captain <em>all the time</em>? She was allowed to have fun, right?</p>
<p class="cnNiYWQ2Y2YzYWNmMDRhY2JiZmEyYzhiNjE1ZTE1ZTA0">“Alright,” she said. “Next week. For the festival.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWU4MTBkZTY2ZDQxMzg4ODYzMzczYzliZmZjYTAx">“Wonderful! Thank you, Serena! You’ve saved my hide!” He gave her a friendly salute. Serena had an increasing suspicion that Amelia and he were going to get on. “Oh, one more thing. Some of the prisoners of war from the Port Highwind liberation were intercepted by the enemy. So keep an eye out, alright? We’ve put a team on the both of you, and it’s possible they’ll try to approach the human while we’re here.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODkxOGUxODVhMjRjM2M4MjEyNmRiNGIzOTgxOTlm">“Republican intelligence is in Kenhoro?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YTliZmExZDJkMzQ4NzI5YTcwODJhZGJlMWUxMWNl">“Probably not. They don’t have the resources. It’ll be Federation boys, which means if something happens, at least try and be a little <em>diplomatic</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM5Mzc0MGQyN2U1NTRlYmY4MjBhZWYwOTc2ODE1YmE4">“... Sure,” Serena said, thinking about the most diplomatic way to stab someone.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWVjZWNmYjIzNjQ1MjFhNjM3YTMyMzQ5NjQzYTA5">“You’ve got that old look in your eye again.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNzBlYTg2MjYyNjQ4NTk4NTM2MjJkMDM3YzhjMWQ5">“What look!?”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTIxZWRiNmQ3YTQzZjg4YTI5ZDgxZTI4YTg4N2E4">“... Nothing.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMjNlYmU2ODE5NjRjNjBhZTAyODdkMDg1YTk5YTM3">“Speaker Halen! Here we are!” The requisition officer reappeared carrying a sack. “Two raincoats, four pairs of boots from size seven through to ten. Four pairs of socks and a pair of rainhats. Sign this, please.” He pushed forward a piece of paper and pen. Serena signed the document, and the sack of clothes was handed to her.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzVlOTIwZjg0MDQyNTVhZmQ3YmJmYWFjODQwNThi">“What will you do now?” She asked Aiden.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzFlNjBlMjBhNzQxMDU4MGFmYzY2M2IyMDVkZDBh">“Well, I should probably follow you, all secret-like,” he shrugged, “but I think I’ll get a drink and start planning the pub crawl…”</p>
<p class="cnNhZDA3ZWM3ODU0OTQyOTdhYzJlZjczZDE3M2VjNDFj">“You’re… incorrigible.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OTFmNDZmNDRmZDQzOWJiNmRjZTVmYjUwOWUzZDVk">“What does that mean?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMzM1ZTQ3YWNiYjRhMzRiOTgwOWEyNzdhZjU0ZjU0">“Just one of the many ways you’re an idiot.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NTA4YjBmNDFkMjQ0YjhhYzI2ZjlkYzg1OTFiYjcz">“Can’t be that much of an idiot! I’m an intelligence officer! Although…” a momentary pause, “Actually, most of them are idiots. Damn it…”</p>
<p class="cnMxNmU2ZWM3YzA2YzRhMWNiNjFmMzhhMDQ1Mzc2NTA3">“Go have your drink, Officer Adachi. I’ll see you in a week.”</p><span class="cjRmMWIwYjI2ZjM4MTRiNDY4M2E2OWE1MzVmNjNiMjAz"><br/>Unauthorized duplication: this narrative has been taken without consent. Report sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM5YWMxOWM4N2Y0YTRmMDc5ZmFjNmY4NDU2MDU3MDlh">“Alright! See you then, don’t do anything stupid while I’m not there!”</p>
<p class="cnNjNjY1YTlmNDRhNzQ1NjhiYzM5MjlkMDJhYWVlNGU2">“Stupid… like what?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNmU2MzU5NDkyMTRhYjdiYjQxZDhlY2NmYTI4YTI3">“Like employ a human speaker, stupid!” He laughed, and Serena joined in. She really enjoyed her time at the academy; demons like Aiden were the closest she had to friends.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmIyYzE1ODRkZjQwOTFhMzdjYzljODE1MzRlZTZi">She waved him off and headed back to the <em>Vengeance</em>. On deck, she found Allston lost in thought.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDg3NzZlZWJmMzQ1NjE5OGFlMjk5NmU4OTNkNjli">“Allston?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNTVjOGE2MWNhMzRlNmE5NzJkMjE0ZDRhOGE0NjBk">“Ah, Captain. They have most of the things we need, but the armour plates won’t be here until the Ponan shipment arrives. So we should be good to go in a month. Thorne's in the armoury, seeing what turrets they have in stock, if any.” That was a relief. The plating was the last work to be done so they could busy themselves with repairing the steel skeleton until the Ponan convoy arrived.</p>
<p class="cnMyZTQyYmI5ZGJkNDRlYWM4YTZiNTAzOTYwYmFiMGQ0">“Good work, Allston,” she said, patting the man on the shoulder. “Try and give your boys some breaks, alright? Have a chat with Tomes and see what extra payment we can arrange.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYzlhZWQ1ODcxNDQzNjc5N2NkZWE0ZTUyOTcxODNj">“Aye, Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNGI4NzFmMTgzODRhYzk4ZWFiZWYzZjllNDlhOTQ4">The chief engineer drifted off into his own thoughts again. Serena left him there and headed back into the ship.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2I3NGZjMTVjMzRkOGFiMTNhN2JiODZlMTQwZWY1">It was time to take Amelia out into the city.</p>
<p class="cnM3Nzc3MjJmMGNlZjQzYWFhZDlhMTUwYTZkNjI4ZjVk"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZGUyZmM0NGFjZDQ3MzZiYmU3ODE4YjQxZTU3ZmMy"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM3NTRkZTYyODE2MzRjM2FhNWUxYjhhNDRhODc0OWI0">Amelia thought that if Serena had taken one minute longer, she would have escaped the ship no matter what. She didn’t want to spend another second here! After Tomes had described more of Kenhoro and its towering pagodas she was itching to see it in person!</p>
<p class="cnMxOWEwNmZmMDI1ODRiZmE5YTRkNWFlZWNmNTBhZjVj">“Finally!” Amelia cried out when the door opened, and the familiar set of magnificent horns appeared. “I was going to die from boredom!” Serena stepped through, carrying a mysterious sack.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjI0MmUyNzlkNjRmOTE4YmZkODQwYzNlOWVhNWQ1">“Wouldn’t want that, would we?” Serena said, before turning her gaze to Tomes, “How’s it going?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZmI3NTBiODdhNDQ4NjE4YWU5ZDdkMGY0NjQzMjc0">“Payments payments and… more payments. These books will take a while,” Tomes peered up through his neat spectacles, raising a finger to point at a small pouch on the table, “Some spending money for you both, a hundred denarii. Take it you two won’t be staying in the barracks?”</p>
<p class="cnNiOGViZDI0YjAwMTQxYjE4YWM2ZGZiYzU0MmNmMjZk">“No,” Serena said, shaking her head and pocketing the small but heavy purse. “I’ll see if Highguard has any rooms. What about you and your brother?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZTNmMmYxZTY4MjRjYzliZTA5OTc0ODU1MDQ1Y2Fi">“We’ll find somewhere. Probably on the outskirts. Hotels are going to be busy near the center with the upcoming festival.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNGVmMjM3ZmY3OTRjNTNiNDc2ZGNjZjkzOTdkYjNi">A festival! “There’s a festival!? What kind!?” Amelia blurted out.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGI4OTA5NDY4NDRjNWVhMmU4YWE3M2I2Y2MzNjhi">“It’s the moonrain festival,” Serena explained, “A celebration of the moon cycle that provides our world with crystals. There’ll be fireworks, music, costumes, and… drinking.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNTMxYzM4YTkzMzQwYTE4MGI4MGFhYTY0N2U3Zjhm">“Can I… can we go?” Amelia asked, trying to inject as much pleading as possible into her voice. She had never been to any kind of festival before, only witnessing them through monitors from her hospital bed.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDcwOGNlMGQ5NzRlM2NhN2ZmOTdiM2I1ZmE1ZDhi">“Sure,” came the reply, and Amelia threw her hands up in celebration. She was going to a festival! “Thank you!”</p>
<p class="cnNmMmZlNzNlZDk0NDQzYzBhNTI5ZWRhMTA2M2VjNjEz">“As long as,” Serena said, raising a finger, “You are good and absorb all the lessons about civilian life I and Tomes are going to be giving you. You need a basic understanding of the laws and what rights you have as a <em>human</em> in <em>demon </em>territory,” she paused for a moment, before continuing, “It’s a little more complicated with you, as you’re employed by House Halen so you have additional privileges that you should know about.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZDU0MWZjNzEzZjRmNTc4ZTQ0NGIyYzI4ZTVjMGY0">Now that was interesting. She was going to ask Serena about these privileges, but Tomes spoke up first.</p>
<p class="cnNmNmMxNTdiNjgzNDRkMzliYjljZTg3YzkxOTVhNWMy">“There’s further complications, Captain,” Tomes said, “I’m not sure if Cascadian Speaker privileges apply to her. She’s not technically a citizen of the Empire. I’m not even sure what she would fall under. A refugee? Doesn’t really fit. And…” He took off these spectacles, habitually cleaning them, “If the Federation or the human Church makes a public claim for her, it could cause an awful set of problems.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYzBjMzBjNjg0MzQ2ZTZhMDRmMjI5NTI5ZjRhYzg3">“Hmmph!” Amelia said, crossing her arms and sticking her head to the side, “I don’t care who or what tries to claim me! I belong to Lady Halen!” She snuck a glance at Serena and was pleased to find a tinge of redness had appeared. Serena was secretly a big softie, wasn’t she?</p>
<p class="cnNiYzM2MmQ4ZTk5YzQ5NmU5NmExMWYwMDIyMzFlNmVm">“Shut up, idiot, and put these on,” Serena dug around in the sack she was holding and threw her an overcoat and several pairs of boots and socks. “It’s a raincoat to put over your uniform. Don’t want you walking around in Republican colours. The first thing we’ll do is head to a tailor and find you… something else.” Serena gestured to the boots. “See what pair fits you the best. Change your socks also.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjk3NTVmNTFmZjQxY2M5MGMxYTBjZTUyYWQ1NWQy">Thank the heavens! The pair she was wearing felt awfully tight, and while her tough skin could never blister, it was still a persistent source of irritation. She untied the laces and removed the old pair. The size seven made it impossible for her to slip her feet in. The eight she could just manage, but the nine fit perfectly. She walked around a bit to get a feel for them, and once she was satisfied, she wormed her way into the raincoat. The thin brown leather easily covered her uniform underneath.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzcyNzAwYzk2MTQ0Mzc4NWZmZDg2MDlhNDQ3YmY3">“All ready!” She flashed Serena a thumbs up.</p>
<p class="cnM0NDUzYjBkYjZmMzRjMWJhNDA1NmQyZDNhODdiMjYz">“Good. Take this, put it on. Tie your hair up so it can’t be seen.” Serena handed her a conical-shaped straw hat. Amelia did as she was told and tied her hair up into a bun before placing the hat on her head and fiddling with the thin chin strap to make it comfortable.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTYzNGYzMjFjZjQ4YTY4ODdlZjE3MTgyNzcwMTJl">“It rains a lot in the east, so you’ll always want to go out with a raincoat and a rainhat. Let’s go. Tomes, I’ll come find you in a day or two, see how our finances are looking.” Serena donned her own raincoat, and before Amelia could ask how she was going to wear the accessory, Serena simply pulled it down on her head, allowing her horns to pierce through the straw. Amelia couldn’t help but let out a giggle.</p>
<p class="cnNhYWY0NTJlN2NhYTRhYjE4ZWY4OTZlMTU3MmViZmY4">“What?” Serena said, looking puzzled.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGI3YWVhNGM2MDRlYTZiZTFjYzc1MDE5ZjFjY2M1">“I thought there would be special hats that account for your horns?”</p>
<p class="cnM0NmFiZjhmNzViNDQ2Njg5ZmJjMzBjZjI2ZWE2Y2I3">“Oh,” Serena tapped the hat, “The individual variation in horns is great enough that they need to be custom-made. I’ll go to a milliner later in the week and have some made.”</p>
<p class="cnM3OGRlMjUxMTAzZTQwMGY4YmU3YjA4M2IxZTllZmQ3">“What’s a milliner?”</p>
<p class="cnM0OGEzNGM3NjUxYzQ5OThiZGM4M2MyNWRiMjZjYjEz">“A hat-maker.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzI0ZjJkNjUxNzQ4ZjZiMTViYjIyODNjNWI5MDE1">“Oh, okay!”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWIwMTA2YWNiNzQ5MmFhMWIzZmE4MzMxY2ViN2Vj">“Ready?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MzYzMDNmZDdiNjQ5ZTZiODlmYjZjYjUxZjZiZGEx">“Yup!” Amelia nodded enthusiastically. Her hat bounced about, so she adjusted the chin strap so it was tighter. She followed Serena through the first deck and outside.</p>
<p class="cnNjZWEzMWM4Y2JiNzRmMTliNjNhNDI1OGU5YjM2ZDEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoa!” she exclaimed in wonder, unable to stop herself.</span> The Imperial docks were massive. She didn’t think she had ever seen so much steel in one place. They stretched in each direction for maybe half a kilometre each, a dozen empty bays to the left and another half dozen to the right. There were a few smaller ships docked up, but nothing the size of the <em>Vengeance</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzM0ZDlhY2YyZDRjZjZiYmNhOGU2MDBmZGQ2NzQw">Each bay had enormous steel towers and other structures around them, some looked like cranes, some looked like the arms used to hold ships in place and the others she had no idea about. Looking up she saw the docks had a second tier, with another dozen and a half bays and beyond that there was a third tier. The scale was hard to wrap her mind around.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzkwNzcyNWU1MDQ5ZmRhNTkyNTc4ZmMzMzU3YTg5">There were huge warehouses lining the wall between the tier she was on and the one above. From these, train tracks spewed out, going off into other areas and the bays themselves. It appeared that moving a ship from the bay into a warehouse was possible if needed.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzMzMDYyODJiMzQzZDViYjAzZjZhNzJiMGVmNzc1">High above, massive brass lettering, perhaps ten meters high, spelt out a phrase in High Imperial. There was another phrase under it in letters half the size. There was a single word she could read here, thanks to her work with Imperial numbers that morning. The number seven hundred and eighty-six.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjY4OTViY2JlMzQzMTE4ZDcwNTdjYWMwZTU2YTRl">“What does that say?” she asked, almost whispering. Serena followed her finger to the giant letters.</p>
<p class="cnNlYWQyN2M4Y2IzYTQxNTA5NzkwNDVmODI3Mzg5ZmU0">“It says, <em>Kenhoro Imperial Airdocks</em>. The bit underneath says <em>Opened In The Year Of Divinity Seven Eighty-Six By The Imperial Highness Of Cascadia</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YWQxZGVkZjVkMzRiZjg4NzkyZDZmM2I1M2I0MzBk">“Imperial Highness being…?”</p>
<p class="cnNjODMwM2QzMWY2MzQ2OGI4MWRkMGVjYzQwNmM2YzIy">“Empress Elana, yes.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYWY5NDY5NDA4YzRlZDhiNzVmYTQxOTdmNTc5Mzc0">“Wow, it’s… so big. There’s so much <em>metal</em> everywhere. It all feels so… practical.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZWYyZDllNDVlOTRhMWE4ZWQwYjgxMzFhM2IzODEz">“That’s Imperial military architecture for you. Kenhoro proper feels completely different. It’s mostly wood and clay. It’s an amazing city. Come on.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YjdmZGUzNzRkZTRlOGI5YzM0YWIxZDg2ZmYxM2Fl">“Okay…” Amelia followed Serena quietly. She kept lifting her head up just to take in the sheer scale of the space, which made her feel tiny. Serena led her through a small opening, and soon, they were lost in a small maze of corridors.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDU3MTBlNmYyMDQ3MDk4MDU3ZDc1MmI3YzRkMTFi">“We’re taking a side exit,” Serena explained, “There will likely be people looking for you at the main gate.” Serena stopped and then looked directly at Amelia. “Never Speak in the city unless your life is in danger. It is against Imperial law to do so in urban areas. There is much greater tolerance for using first, second, and third-circle spells or techniques to defend yourself, but you should still only use these if needed. Understand?”</p>
<p class="cnMyZTMzMzYyYmY5NzQ0ZTlhNWI5NDUwZDA3NDUwZTZj">Amelia nodded furiously. Once she and Serena were closer, she would tell her that she could Speak covertly and ask her how the law handled that.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDBiMWMyZmI3MjRiYjQ4NjQ0MzQ0OWFmZjUwZmZm">“Second, if you ever get lost or something goes wrong, come back here to the ship. Use the symbol of my house Tomes gave you to get through the gate. If that doesn’t work, force your way through and get on the ship. You’ll see once we get out, but the Imperial docks have a series of huge lighthouses above them, they can be seen throughout most of the city.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNmEzZDkyZTlmZjQ1MTFhZmYxMjBhZTFiZTYyMzQw">“I understand!”</p>
<p class="cnNhZDJlNTRhN2VmNTQxYzZiZmM3Y2I5YTU4ZjYwYWIz">“Good, let’s go.” They continued for a minute and then came to a steel gate manned by a pair of guards. Serena spoke to them quietly for a moment, and they suddenly enthusiastically saluted her. Seeing that made Amelia feel proud. Her captain was so cool and respected! The guards opened the gates, and they stepped through into Kenhoro proper.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTg3ZmZiODM4NTQ4Y2FiYmRiYTBjNTIwOTgwY2Qx">For the second time, Amelia couldn’t stop exclaiming in wonder. The streets were paved and lined with lamposts and trees. Hundreds of people formed small groups going this way and that. There was a light rain, and everyone was wearing some form of raincoat and rainhat. The people moved like brown blobs, although some were brightly coloured, especially the children, whose little horns poked through their straw hats. They were so adorable!</p>
<p class="cnNkYWFiMGQ1NTg1NTQ1NDc5ZTM2MTZmZTgzYjRjMDlk">There were some humans mixed in as well. One in ten. On average, they were shorter than the demons, and their intact straw hats stood out amongst a sea of horns.</p>
<p class="cnM2NjZjYzRlMzUzNzQ4NzdhODA0YTBjZWZlYjc0MDFm">The street was lined with three-story buildings, the bottom floor being a shop of some kind. Amelia couldn’t read the shop names, but she could see a cobbler, a flower shop and a cafe or two. Some of the signs were written in a different script she had never seen before. She pointed it out to Serena.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTc4ZmE3NWY0ZDRlYTFiYzZlNzZiYjA3NTJkZmY0">“That’s Manwese, the native language of this region - Kenhoro, Tanhae, Ponan, and some of Shimashina - High Imperial is only truly dominant in Centralis, and its culture and language has naturally exported itself to the Terra Firmas over the centuries. Everyone speaks Imperial though so you needn’t worry.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTI2YzY1Y2YwZjQ5YjJiNGY5NzEyNjNmMzVmYzdi">“The buildings look gorgeous!” Amelia exclaimed, and they did. Each floor was separated by a curved tiled roof that jutted out from the white-washed walls, supported by thick beams of dark wood. The ends of these beams ended in carvings of strange animals.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTg1NGQ3MDZhNjRlMzJiMWY0ZmQ4YmQyNmM4OWVl">“It’s called a gabled roof. All the roofs in the region are curved like this. It’s effective at keeping the rain off. Look at that one. Can you see how it has a triangular piece on top?” Serena gestured to a building down the street, and Amelia saw a pagoda standing five stories tall, topped with a fancy-looking triangle-tiled structure decorated with small statues. “That’s a hip-and-gable roof. Important buildings like shrines or government buildings have them.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MjQ1NWVmOTExODQ4OWJhYzEzYzEwMDJjMDA1YmI5">“And is this some kind of shrine?” Amelia could see some people bowing towards the structure as they passed. Something seemed to be giving off smoke. Were they burning incense?</p>
<p class="cnNjMGFlZjNmMzlhMDRiMzJiMTExYzJlMmNiY2YwNjg5">“Yes, it’s a religious structure, built as a home for the Kami.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NmIzNjZkZWJmMTQyNDU4OGE1M2QyMTkwNDQ3Yzll">“Kami?”</p>
<p class="cnNhYWQyMTg0NzRiZTQ2MjU5MGQ1OWQ3NTU3YTAxNjlh">“Spirits of the elements. Quinto is the dominant religion here, and it worships the Kami.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZTg1NzVjZjYzMzQwNDhhN2Y3ZWQwMGVjMmYyNGU2">This was confusing. Wasn’t the Empress supposed to be a literal thousand-year-old god? Why would they worship something else? Was that even allowed? Amelia raised her questions with Serena, who explained that the Quinists believed that the Empress was a great Kami taking demon form.</p>
<p class="cnNjODcxNzc2MjNjNDRlMDc5OGFiNDQ1MzU4ODA0M2Mz">“There are many religions in the four corners of Cascadia, and you’ll find out that they all - in some way or another - worship the Empress.” That made sense. If the Empress was a thousand years old then the religions would have adapted and formed around her as a central figure.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzI5YjBjMmYxZDRlYTNhNzAyYjU1ZjNhNWIyZWJk">“I see…”</p>
<p class="cnMzNzQzMWQ4MzJlZDQ3ZWU4YzRjMjFjODhkMTVmYmMy">“Come now,” Serena led her through the crowd and down the streets, eventually stopping and stepping into a tailor’s shop. “Here,” Serena said, indicating towards some coat hooks at the entranceway. “Every shop or eatery has these to put your raincoats and hats on.” Serena removed her outer layer, and Amelia followed.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjk3MjViZWZkOTQ2MmU5MmMwY2E5ZDYwYjU1OWNi">“You are Clothmaster Dai?” Serena asked the short demon tailor who was waiting patiently. “You fixed my father's suits a few summers ago, is that correct?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjZjNmZiN2ZkZTRkZTU4MzY4ZDE1OWU4Nzk1YTQx">“That’s right, Lady Halen, I presume?” The female tailor gave a small bow. “It’s an honour to have the famous Speaker and captain in my shop. How may I- oh my!” The tailor's eyes went wide as she bounced up to Amelia, and before she could protest, Amelia found herself being turned this way and that. “What a dreadfully fitting uniform! Surely this wasn’t provided by House Halen!?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZDI2YmM4ZTQ1MTQzYTc4ODIyMjJhMTYzNjU0OWM5">“No,” Serena said, an amused look in her eye as the eager demon manhandled Amelia. “She is an employee of the house, only recently signing a contract. This old Republican uniform is the only thing that fits her. I’m looking to have a few outfits made.”</p>
<p class="cnMzODA1NDkyNzJlNDQ2YTBhYzdiNDg3ODJkMGJmZDUx">“Of course, of course.” A tape measure appeared from somewhere and suddenly Amelia was directed to stick her arms and legs out in different directions while the tailor eagerly took measurements. “What kind of work will she be assigned?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTQ2YWU4YmY3ZTQ1YTY5ZjUwN2ZlZmQwOGE0ZTc0">“... I’m not sure. We need something practical and easy to move in. Three sets should do, I think. Also, another three sets of casual wear. We also want a formal suit and several sets of bedwear. Oh…” Serena paused for a moment, looking away from Amelia, “And a pair of dresses, red.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYWI3YzY1MjdmOTRmNTI5YjkzNzlmZjA3Nzk2ZTY5">Oh? “Dresses?” She asked, raising an eye at Serena.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmJjN2VjNWYwYzRkMDViODlkNzgxOWQxMDg0YTZj">“Yes… for the festival.”</p>
<p class="cnNmOTk1NzIxZWI0YzQxMGY5OGI5NWM0MzE1ZjcxNmVh">“Are you going to be wearing a dress?”</p>
<p class="cnMyM2UzODgzYWIzNTRkYjQ5NDdjNDk5YWFjM2FkZjBl">“... of course.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMTM5NGFmYmIyODQ2NDViYWYzZWEzMDAxOTdhNzJm">How exhilarating. Amelia had never seen Serena in anything other than her uniform or the medical wing garments. Hell, Serena even slept in her uniform most of the time! It was criminal to hide all those curves behind a stiff military outfit! Now she was even more excited for the upcoming festival.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTIwNjRiYzdkOTQ5MTNiMGE5ZDk1NjI5MmFkZjhk">“Lady Halen, we’re all done. Any preference for colour for the work uniforms?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YjQyOTE2ZWE0MDQ0Y2NiMjlmZDljYmQ2MjQ4YzUw">“Dark grey or black, with silver trim. As for the casual clothes, keep the colours dull, something that can easily blend in.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OGM1YzA5NDI0MTQyNTBiYjI5ZjA4YmMwYWIzYjZh">“Of course,” said the tailor. “For now, you must let me put her in something that isn’t so outrageous! Those Republicans really have no sense of style. Hmm… here we go!” A set of clothes was fished out from a stack of uniforms and handed to her. “These should be far more comfortable. Head through there, my dear. Shout if you have any trouble.” The demon gestured to a curtained area.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTFhMTc3MDA0NTQ0NDhiNzJkNTA5NjRmMmViMzJj">“O-okay! Thank you, Miss Tailor!” She gave a small bow and hurried into the side room. Pulling the curtain along the rail, Amelia undressed and began slipping into the new clothes. They were light brown and grey, but the clothes were clearly very high quality and more comfortable than her previous uniform. It took her a while to work out how to tighten certain parts. There were tassels that seemed to be elastic that could be pulled and fixed into place.</p>
<p class="cnM1YmQxZTU4N2U3NzRlMDY5ODNiNTAzZDhiMzNiNzJm">Eventually, she was happy with how it felt, and she stepped outside the side room.</p>
<p class="cnMzYWFjNWMwYmI1YzQ5NjdiMjBkZDNjNDZkMmI4NmJl">“Much better,” Serena said approvingly.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTg0NjI0MGU4ODQ5NmNiOWJjODM1M2FmY2FlMGVi">“Oh my dear, you’ve tightened it all wrong!” The tailor ducked all around her, adjusting parts here and there, and the clothes that had already felt comfortable now felt like second skin. “Try moving,” the tailor said.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDNmNDFiMTEyNjQ2MGI4OGU1YmEyMDllM2Q4YWU3">Amelia moved her arms and walked around the room. “This feels amazing,” she said, “I never knew clothes could feel this comfortable! You’re amazing!” Amelia gave a genuine compliment.</p>
<p class="cnNjNDE4MDNlZGM3YTQ1YzU5ZDYzNTIwZmM4MWY5NjEx">“Oh, thank you, dear,” the tailor said with a smile on her face. “It’s not just me! That’s wool from the sheep fields of Fengra! Very expensive, but very comfortable.”</p>
<p class="cnMyODdiMTAzY2FjMjQ0NGQ4Mjg0YzRjODhmM2E4OTRj">“How long will the clothes take to tailor?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjU2NWI2MWY3MDQzZjM4ZTE4MGE5YjVhOTc2MzVl">“Hmm… six days for the work and casual uniforms, another three for the suit and another three for the two dresses. Let’s call it a fortnight.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NzI3ZmNmZDA1NzQ1NWJhNDM5N2Q4YWRiYTczYWZl">“Price?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YWQ4YTRlOWFhNTQyMjI4OWExZDUwMTI1ZWQ3Yzc4">“Two hundred and twenty denarii. I’ll have to buy the dye for the dresses, but I won’t charge for that! Just let me see her wear it!” The tailor beamed at her. What was she, some kind of dress-up doll?</p>
<p class="cnNlNDU5ZjE0NWRlZTQ0NmQ5YTVjMDRkMTRkNzUxZTU3">And what was that price!? If she remembered right, these clothes were equal to about <em>two years</em> of a normal soldier's salary! So this is the price of someone with the title of <em>Clothmaster?</em></p>
<p class="cnM0M2FhMzJmMzAwNTRkMWFiMjY4N2EzYjNjZjY1NWIw">“Right, we’ll need at least one set of uniforms as soon as possible. After that, prioritize the dresses in time for the festival. Where's your credit book?” Serena asked, and the tailor provided her with a small book that Serena wrote in. She then ripped a page out of the book and handed it to the tailor.</p>
<p class="cnMyN2I2MjNlMTA2MjQ0MmI4OTkzY2Y1MGFhNDgzM2Y2">“Thank you for your custom, Lady Halen,” said the tailor, giving another small bow. “And thank you, miss,” She bent her head in Amelia’s direction, “for allowing me to make you such fine clothes!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNDQwYmQ5ODY0NDRkOWU4MjQ2MWI2MGQxYzBhMDEw">“Uh, no problem! I can’t wait to see them!”</p>
<p class="cnNkMTE2N2YyZjE4NTRkYmE4MDg4N2UxODIzNDIzZWIz">“Come on, you,” Serena pulled her to the shop exit, where they donned their raincoats and hat. “Let’s go,” she said, stepping outside the shop.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTExMzRkOTRkMTQwNzlhNjIwY2U1NWUzM2Q0ZWFi">“Where are we going now?” Amelia asked. There was a moment of silence, and then the answer came, softly spoken.</p>
<p class="cnMwNGJkNzdmMzhiMzQ3OWVhMDNmNGM1NWQwMDFhMmVk">“To get a hotel room…”</p>
<p class="cnMyMWY5NWRkNWY3MzQ2YmI4MjE3MmU3MGI0ZDk2MDM2">How scandalous that sentence was! As she was led once again through the crowd, Amelia let her mind come up with all kinds of inappropriate scenarios.</p>
<p class="cnM3MzYzZTc1ZmFlOTRhZGU4YTU0MGI5ZDRlOTI3ODhl">The best part was Serena had said <em>room</em>, singular!</p>
<p class="cnM0NWI3MDFjNDAyNzRkOGViODU5YWI4MjFmNzE2M2Nh">What a flirtatious captain she was becoming…</p>

      <description>Chapter Fifteen: Matching Masks</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNhMmZmMGQzOGI2MTQyY2I5MWY5ZWFmZmY1MDkzNWY5"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNjNjBlNGU5NmE0ZjQ4NmFiZmEwOGFmYjI4MjExYmNi">As Serena led her charge towards the center of Kenhoro she was constantly bombarded with questions. Amelia was intrigued by every little sight or smell. Honestly, it was endearing to see somebody so fascinated by demon culture. On more than one occasion, Serena had to stop Amelia from walking into someone as she was so distracted by the next shiny thing.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjEzZTlmMzdhNDQwMGQ5NDUwYzUwOGI3YTIwZGEy">She did her best to answer what she could, although she often failed to give further detail when the inevitable follow-up questions were thrown her way. The culture in Kenhoro and the surrounding area was familiar to her due to her military career, which caused her to spend a significant amount of time docked. However, she was not a native, and her homeland - The Three Sisters - was several hundred klicks to the southeast.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzA3ODQ4YWFkZTQxNTlhODg4MmExZTU1NGYzZDIx">“This is the Kenhoro procession, the main thoroughfare in the city,” she said to Amelia as they stepped onto the enormous paved street. Frequent trams passed them, excess steam hissing out the tops as they trundled past in the tracks embedded in the ground. “Here, hold on.” She wrapped an arm around Amelia’s waist and hoisted the both of them onto a passing tram.</p>
<p class="cnM1YWFiMTg4YTU1MjRlZGVhZGIzYmM0ZjEyZGY2ZTNl">An interesting noise came from the human, which she almost ignored.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzc4M2I4NmQ5MTRiNmNhZmE5ZjQwMjI0MzFhNGE5">“Sorry. Getting on and off a moving tram is an urban skill you’ll need to learn quickly,” Serena cast an apologetic look at the red-cheeked girl. “Never walk along the tracks. The trams have scoops installed on their fronts to push pedestrians out of the way, and the drivers are perfectly happy to use them.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MmFiYzFjMDEwYTQ0NGRhMDg5ODJlNGQ5NDUzODcx">“Okay! There are <em>so many</em> people!” Amelia said. The tram was almost full, and outside there was a constant river of people moving up and down the procession. “How many people do you think live in the city?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMjNkMmJmOGZhODQwYmM4M2ZiZTVkN2FkMTVhNTc3">“About a million, give or take. Probably another two hundred thousand in the surrounding area. You should see the Centralis Basin. The last census of that region came to <em>eighty million people</em>! It’s probably eighty-five now,” Serena shook her head, “Imagine the logistics to feed that many people! Kenhoro is a big place, but it has no underground. In Centralis, there are thousands of klicks of tunnels through the mountains and earth, connecting them all.”</p>
<p class="cnNjN2YyYWY4MTMwYjQ4N2E5MzdhY2E0NDhkZGNhNGY0">Amelia looked at her with wide eyes. “Whoa!” She exclaimed. “Can we go there?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YTlhMTUzOTMyOTRkZjg4MDI5YTA5MTc5NzI0MWVj">“Eventually,” Serena said. They would inevitably, at some point. If she were going to receive a silver eagle for her work, they would typically invite her to the capital for the ceremony. “We can see the titan,” she said.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzA0NTkxMjliNDQyZTZhNmU2YmNiMzYyMWU5NmU4">“Titan?”</p>
<p class="cnNiMDI5ZGM3MTgxNjQyNjE5YjUyYjhmZTMyMTNlZDA3">“Tomes gave you a history lesson right? About how the Empress was victorious against the Titans?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNjNjZGIxMTM1OTRkMzFhY2NhMzY1Njk1ZTU1MGM0">“I think so…? He mentioned gigantic monsters at some point.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMTRhYjc3ZDBmNzQ3NDZiMjhiNjFlMWQxODU2Mjkx">“The Titans were the generals of that ancient enemy. They led the legions of beasts and were felled one by one by the Empress. Other than the bones that were used in the construction of the Cathedral of Bone in the capital, there wasn’t much evidence of the rest of them.</p>
<p class="cnNlYzUzNTQ0YzkyMjRlNDRhZTNjOGE0YjcxODVlNGJl">“That was until a century and a half ago when they began digging the underground railway in the Centralis Basin. They came across a gigantic skeleton of a creature slain long ago. Only the skull is accessible to the public, but they’ve turned it into somewhat of a tourist attraction.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMDE4ODg5OWFkYzQwNmViM2JhOGI1MTE5ZTA5MjU4">Amelia’s eyes grew even wider. “Have you ever seen it!?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZGZjMTc5ZWNmZDQ3MTlhOTk2YjVmM2EzMTJhNDY0">“No,” Serena said, shaking her head. “And yes to the question you’re about to ask. We’ll try to find time to visit it when we go central.”</p>
<p class="cnM0OTZmNzc3MzA2ODQzYzFiZDUxYjJjMTA1MDI4OWEw">“Thank you!” Amelia beamed, flashing her a perfect smile. Serena let herself enjoy that smile for a few seconds. “You know, eighty million isn’t that much,” Amelia whispered, moving in closer. “The biggest nation from where I came from had <em>three billion</em> <em>people</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTcwMWQ2NWI1NDQ3YjRiNjRkZGU1MjBiNzc1N2E3">Serena narrowed her eyes and found Amelia wasn’t jesting. Three billion people. How could she even begin to imagine that? “All human?” She asked, and Amelia nodded back. Christ. That was a lot of… humans. “How would you even feed that many people?”</p>
<p class="cnNkMGUwMGQ0N2U1OTRkYTRiYWJhNmM3ZWE4NTg3NzE0">“Mmm…” Amelia’s eyes looked thoughtful, “You know how advances in metallurgy allow better armour and better engines to be made?” Serena nodded. “Well, I guess we’ve perfected growing crops. Better fertilizers. Centuries of breeding the best crops. It’s all automated also.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDc2NWI1YWE2NDQ2NjI4OTlhZWRjNjBmOGVjODJl">“Automated?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjEyMTdlM2MzMjQ0YWRiYTFlM2E2MTgyOWI4ZjQz">“Yeah, like…” Amelia raised her hands, seemingly struggling to find the words. “Imagine an advanced steam engine, but it’s smart enough to know how and when to perfectly plant, grow and harvest crops. It can work day and night, farming hundreds of kilometres of farmland year-round.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YWYwZTAzOTU3MjQ3ZTk4NDU3ZGVkNGQ4NmQ5NDli">“That’s interesting. My sister would be very interested in hearing about that.” What Amelia described sounded like a far more advanced version of the golems widely used in the southern desert.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzQwYWMxMTM5ZjQ5OGQ4ZjMxZjAxOGFiYTk3ZjEx">Amelia opened her mouth to reply, but they were interrupted by the tram conductor.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDYxZmIyN2MyMTQ2YTNhZTQwYzVlMjQ3YzY1MjY3">“Tickets! Don’t think I missed you sneaking on back there!” The smartly dressed demon called out, pushing his way through the crowd and up to them. Serena adjusted her raincoat, pulling it so that her shoulder with the gold thread and military insignia could be seen. The conductor paused for a moment before motioning his head towards Amelia.</p><span class="cjM5ODYzMjcxNGQwODQ2YjVhMjc3N2FhMDc5YTMxZjhh"><br/>Unauthorized use: this story is on Amazon without permission from the author. Report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1YjA4M2FmY2RhNzQxYTdiNDU0ZDhmYTg3M2U0NGM1">“She’s with me,” Serena said. The conductor nodded and made his way back down the tram. Serena covered her uniform back up and saw Amelia looking at her with a questioning expression painted on her face. “All military can ride transport in the city for free,” Serena explained. “Came into effect a couple of years ago. Speakers also have that privilege, although…” She bent down slightly, lowering her voice. “Don’t pull that trick when you’re alone, not until we can figure out where you stand legally. You’re not a citizen of this region or the Empire.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ODI5ZDYxMGE2NDRjMzdhNDg2Y2U0MGYwN2Q3N2Jm">“How do I become a citizen?” Amelia whispered back.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTU5NDMxNjYwMzRiYzY4Yjk2NzExNzJiODg3Mzhi">“I suspect an offer might be made to you sooner rather than later, once your lack of ties to…” Serena dropped her voice as quietly as she could, “... the enemy is confirmed.” Amelia nodded, and her blue eyes moved to an area above Serena's shoulder.</p>
<p class="cnNkODM4ZjdiNjEwYjRmMWY4N2QzYzYyNDdmYTNhZTdi">“Is that the lighthouse you talked about?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNjYyYTM0OGU3NjQ0ZmE4ODcyYmE4M2QyYzg0M2Ji">Serena turned and saw the towering steel lighthouse. Even during midday, the enormous aetherlight still shone brightly. “Yes,” she said. “There are two more, but you can’t see them. Use them as a landmark to return to the docks if you need to.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZTc4MjJhYWIwNjQ3MTM5NzZhNjQ2NGRjM2NmOTJl">“Okay! Do you… expect there’ll be trouble during our stay?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMmIxNTM2NjcwYTQzNzg4NGYyYWY5YTJkZDliOTU1">Serena paused, thinking over how to answer the question. She couldn’t say no, but couldn’t guarantee a yes either. It depended on how aggressive Cascadian and Federation intelligence would be. If there were heretical or Republican cells in Kenhoro then an outright kidnapping or assassination attempt wasn’t out of the question.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmU3YWQyMzFlYjRhMzhiYTMyZDRlYWVhNGQ0ZTIy">“There’s a possibility. You’re keeping your wards up at all times?” Seeing Amelia nod quickly, she asked, “How are your aether reserves?” The cloaked ward Amelia had cast on Serena was still maintained.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzRmNWJiNTI2ZTRiMjA5ZDBiYjlmNGNkMzRkYWZh">“It’s manageable. When we find time, I want to try some others, if that’s okay.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDkyNjQxNTgzZjQ1NGZiYjQ1YTAwMWNhZWU0YjQ2">“... Sure,” Serena said. “Let’s jump off here.” Serena could have let Amelia jump off by herself, but she was curious as to whether the human would make that cute noise again. She slipped an arm around Amelia's waist and, while pulling her tight, hopped off the tram.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDlkZWZkYTc4NjQ2NWNhNTA3NzU2N2IyYWJhOWU3">Her efforts were not in vain.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2RiODk2YTZkNjQyOTBiMmE0NGQ4YjQ3ZWVhMzZi">“Let’s head this way, through the central market,” Serena said, leading the red-faced girl. The light rain had stopped, but she warned Amelia to keep her hat on so that her golden hair was hidden. They slipped in with the river of pedestrians, and soon a massive cascade of noise and smells assaulted them.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODg5MTc5OWY3NzQxODI5YTk0MmJkNTcwMjNmZDk4">“Spices! Black spices all the way from the desert!”</p>
<p class="cnM5M2Q4MGE3OTUyYTRjZDZhYWYxZGRkMzE2OWZlZmE5">“Northern spirits! Whiskey from Kasimanda! Vodka from Skipifold!”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmMwODU1ZGNlNTQyOWQ5YzgyNmNmMzliMjkwMTM3">“Come get the best Vinay kebabs! Slow-cooked for twenty-four hours!”</p>
<p class="cnNmZWFlNzNkM2I3YTQyYzM5OGU1OWZhMjM0NDdlYzIx">“Masks! Get your festival masks here! Crystal jewellery for your horns!”</p>
<p class="cnNjMTczZjI1YjVhNjRhZGRiZWQ5NjQ4ZmY2M2IyMmQ2">A city of market stalls called out to them. They were brightly coloured, with enticing signs and aggressive stall owners — anything to grab a potential customer's attention.</p>
<p class="cnMxODk1OWQ3YTYzNDRlOTQ4ZjBmM2M1MDkxZTQxYjZl">“Masks!” Amelia pulled Serena to one of the stalls.</p>
<p class="cnNiYjQxMzY0NDZhNDRlODA4MGQ0N2FjMmQ4Mzc1YmFm">“We have carnival masks in every colour you can dream of, young ladies!” The shopkeeper’s words flowed naturally from his mouth. “The festival is only around the corner! I would hate to see you unadorned with the very best accessories in Kenhoro! Look here,” the man gestured to his wares, “We have masks in patterned cloth for those after a simple look, or if you want to stand out, we have ones decorated in coloured quartz! And for the extra special customer who truly wants to impress a man…” The stallkeeper pointed to a row of masks behind a glass cabinet. “Masks lined with cut moon crystals from the four corners of Cascadia!”</p>
<p class="cnNiYjM1NGZhZWRhMzQ3MmQ4MGZjYjNmMTdhYzY3NmYw">“Not all the corners,” Serena pointed out, “You’re missing red crystal.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNTM0MmU3ZGVlOTQ4YjY4ZjkxODkxNzMyMmMwY2E3">“Right you are, dear customer! Unfortunately, due to the ongoing conflict, the red stuff is a little hard to get these days. I could put in an order for you, of course!” The stallkeeper rubbed his hands together.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzQ2ZWI4ZGM0NDQ1YmVhMjVhMTk0MWIyNWVkODUw">“Can I try this on?” Amelia pointed towards one of the carnival masks donned in blue moon crystal. The stallkeeper eagerly unlocked the cabinet and handed the mask to Amelia, who looked up at Serena. Amelia held the mask in position. “What do you think? Matches my eyes, right?”</p>
<p class="cnM1OWNhNjkwMDQ5YjRkZTJhY2JkYTZlMjdlMTU0OGM4">Serena swallowed awkwardly. How did adding a small carnival mask add so much… enticement? The blue glow from the crystal only highlighted Amelia’s eyes more. “Take the hat off,” she told Amelia, “See if it fits properly.” Amelia obeyed, removing the hat and revealing her golden hair.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzAxOGY2NTZkMTRlY2ViZTViMjQ0NWRjNmRhOGVl">“A human…” the stallkeeper mumbled before quickly turning back into cheerful merchant mode. “What brilliant golden hair you have! It shines even more than my wares! If I may ask, dear customer, whence do you hail from?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OGIxOGNjMGJmNjQ4NzE5OWJhYzUxZDE1ZmZkMTEx">“She’s from Karligard,” Serena said before Amelia could respond. She hadn’t missed the brief drop in the stallkeeper's face when he had seen Amelia's lack of horns. Discrimination had been rising through the years, and the humans in Kenhoro had slowly been grouping closer to their districts on the outskirts. “It looks good,” she said as Amelia finished adjusting the mask. Good was an understatement. Amelia looked stunning.</p>
<p class="cnM4MmY3NGUzNjFlYjRjYTA4MzM4MThmNmY4YmFkNDQx">“You like it? Okay then! I’ll buy it! How much?” Amelia grinned at the compliment.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTM4NjE1NDM1NDQxOWJhOWJhMDEwMmRmNzRlNjhj">“You don’t need to buy something just because I said so, you know,” Serena said, trying and failing to chastise the girl.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTkxYzFlMWJjNzQ5NzQ4NjdhYTI0YzRlZGFhYWEx">“I know, but I want to dress up for the festival. What about you?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OTcwNTUzNjAzZTRlNWY4ZmUxZTIzMTVmZTQ2YjVh">“What about me?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMTJmNmM2YmI1NjQ2Mzk4OTY5MjkwNTQwMGM2Nzg0">Amelia turned to the stallkeeper. “How quickly can you get one just like this,” Amelia motioned towards the mask on her face, “But with red crystals?” Amelia turned to Serena, motioning towards her eyes. “For your red eyes. It should match, no?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMGIzZjM2ZjQxMTRmNjhiOTE2YjE3MGFiMjU1MTA5">“Red is expensive these days. I don’t want to spend that much on a mask. I’ll get something like this…” Serena picked up one of the masks patterned in red cloth.</p>
<p class="cnM1MTc2MjFjZGE4MzQxZGRhYTJhNWVlYzQwMDY0NzI0">“No, no!” Amelia protested, shaking her head. “We have to match, or there’s no point! Mr Stallowner, can you get a red one like this in time for the festival?”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjIyMzg4NDkzYjQ2YWJiZDNiZjQzYzYwYTUzMTA1">The stallkeeper's expression was puzzled as he listened to their back-and-forth and was a little slow to react. “Ah, of course,” he said, "Of course!” He clasped his hands together. "I can have it ready within two days. Is that acceptable for you?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZGI2ZTYxMmNmYjQzZWFiYTllZjdkNDY0MzNiYjEy">Serena began to protest, but Amelia cut her short. “I will pay for it! Don’t worry! How much is it, Mr Stallowner?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNGI4ODRkMThjMzRlZjc5ZGVkZmVkOWE4ZWE2MTNl">“Thirty for the blue mask and fifty for the red one.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMjAxOTJlMzM3NjRlYTU5ZDMwN2Q0MTZkZTFmZTMy">“Okay!” Amelia turned to Serena. “You have the money on you, right? Take it out of my wages for this month!” Serena looked at Amelia for a moment. She would have to teach her the price of things. These two masks were half a year of a soldier's salary.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjgxNjEyZGZjZDQwYjY5ZDU4NWZmMmJhZmQ2MmMz">“My dear customer, what a wonderful choice! Would you like me to gift wrap them for you? Free of charge!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NWFlYTg2MjYwNDQ1MjhhNTdmNmEzYzNiZGE1ZmI0">“Yes, please!” Amelia removed the blue mask and handed it back to the stallkeeper, who busied wrapping and bagging it. Serena handed the man his money, and the purse Tomes had given her felt far lighter. The stallkeeper handed Amelia the bag and a receipt so she could pick up the remaining mask in the future.</p>
<p class="cnNmNWFhZGZhYTJlZTQwYWRiMGQyZjk4NzhkYjU0YzZm">“Here you go, valued customer. If I may ask, you spoke of wages. From what profession do you hail from?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZTE4YWRkZDc0MDRkNGM5YTJkYmM2MWRmMDY5ZmEy">Amelia flashed a grin and jabbed a thumb at her chest.</p>
<p class="cnMwZWYyOWQ3NzY1NjQ3NzM4ZWQ1ZDZhYjRlYjAzYzY4">“I’m her maid!”</p>
<p class="cnNkNjBiMzI5ZmIyMDQ2YTdiYzY4MWFhNDk3OWFhNzkz">Serena sighed.</p>
<p class="cnM5MmE1YjBiYmYxMDRiNmZhMDAwOTkxY2EwNDAzNGZm">Idiot.</p>

      <description>Chapter Sixteen: A Highguard Mystery</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMyYTYwNWQxOTg1YzRjZTlhNzNiZTBmNWZmYjY1M2Rh"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMyNjAyMTExMzc4NDRiNTVhMTk1NjBkMTQ3MmIxMDkw">Hotel Highguard oozed wealth. Its lobby was lined with marble walls, and the floor was covered with a shiny black rock Amelia had never seen before. A dozen pedestals were dotted about, each holding an expensive-looking piece of earthware inscribed with ornate patterns. On the far side of the lobby, a grand staircase layered with a red carpet led to the floors above. There were two elevators to one side, each with a demon attendant.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzU2MWRmMDcyODQ0OWY5NjhiZGIzOTgzMDBiYTk5">“Take your raincoat and hat off,” Serena said as she removed her own. “Hold these,” she said, passing them to Amelia, who tried to fold them awkwardly over her arm while holding the gift-wrapped bag from the market outside. “Hurry up,” Serena commanded as she strutted off to the reception.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDM2MTdmNjU0OTQ0MTk5N2FmMjAzZjRhZDExYjNm">“Yes, Lady Halen!” Amelia piped up, remembering Serena’s instructions to be on her best behaviour. She followed behind obediently.</p>
<p class="cnMyNGNkZGY0MDMxNjQ2Yzk5NzU5ODE0ODM0ZmQ3ZmRm">The receptionist gave a deep bow as they approached. “Welcome to the Highguard, Speaker Halen,” said the receptionist politely, “Or do you prefer Captain?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTNlNmY5NTJhMDQ3NWVhMGJmNGY2NWM4NTIwYTVh">“Speaker Halen,” Serena said, “Is the owner in?”</p>
<p class="cnNlOWIxMmIxNWFjMjQwZDk5NmU2MDZkYzJhZjI1OWI1">“The owner is unfortunately occupied for the foreseeable future,” the receptionist explained, his eyes briefly flicking to Amelia. “I can pass on a message for you.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MmI2OWVhYWI3MjRjZDM4ZjEwYWY1ZWM4MWYzOWQz">“No need,” Serena said, resting an arm on the receptionist’s desk. “We require a twin room. One month. For both of us.” Serena gestured to Amelia at her side. The receptionist blinked a few times before a smile formed on his face that didn’t quite reach his eyes.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzcyYTcyNDA0NzQ3MTZhYzU0NTA5NzQzYzdjZWE5">“Our greatest apologies, Speaker Halen. All our rooms are fully booked for the next three months.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTIwZmIwZGU5MTQ4Mjk5NDc0ODQ1MzY5ZjM3NmI5">“I'm sure they are. However, I am well aware the Highguard always keeps rooms in reserve. We’d like one of them,” Serena said, her voice taking on a hard edge. Amelia couldn’t help but start to feel a little excited. Serena in authoritative mode was her second favourite Serena mode, coming in shortly behind secret-big-softy mode.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjI2NzUxZWVmMjRlYWVhZjhkM2RmNGFhMzg4ZTZl">“Once again, I sincerely apologize, Speaker Halen. We are unable to provide one of the reserve rooms… in this case.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YmMwNDE4ZjM0ZDRjMDc4MWNlN2M4ZDRlODMxNDE2">“Oh?” Amelia noticed Serena’s eyes narrowing. The danger level was increasing. She quickly checked Serena’s waist and was relieved to see Serena wasn’t carrying her normal cutlass. “And if you could explain <em>precisely</em> what you mean by <em>this case</em>?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZTRhNjhlOThhNzQ3ODU5MzZlMTA3NDBhMDMzMmY3">“Of course, Speaker Halen,” the demon nodded his head, “We currently have a large number of military staying with us. Many of these guests are extra vigilant regarding their surroundings, and I believe there is a high chance of conflict arising if you and your…” a set of orange eyes met Amelia’s, “... assistant stayed with us.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NTAwMWI2ZjE2YTRlNmU5MzM1YWQ1MWI1N2Q2ZTRl">Serena was silent for a full ten seconds, staring down at the receptionist whose calm facade was just starting to crack, his smile looking a little more nervous than before.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTU5NWQwNDIyZjRjZmRhOTEzZTJlMTQ3YWViMmMz">“Military?”</p>
<p class="cnMwZGRmNGM5ZjA3YjRiMGJhOWUxNGJkYjQwMzJmNzll">“That is correct, Speaker Halen.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMTFhY2I0ZDA4ODQ5ZTA5ZTM4NjkzZjcxNjEzMGI4">“From which battalion or squadron?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NjkwMzZmMWM4ZjQ5NjRiZmU4NmFhYjJlNGU2N2Fm">“I… believe they take the name of the Crimson Reapers.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MjE0ZjRhNGE2ZjQ3YTc4YTY2MDY1NjBmNWQ2N2Q5">“Mercenaries! Tsk!” Serena clicked her tongue, tapping the desk with a forceful finger. “When in the seven hells did Highguard start housing <em>mercenaries and privateers</em>?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMjc2NmM3MmRkOTQ4NzRiMGY0YzA5MTIxODY3MmNl">“The activities of our valiant and brave guests have allowed them to meet our very competitive prices, Speaker Halen. They have purchased all available rooms.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MjViMmE2MGZlZDQ5NmI4Y2E4Y2IzZTBjNTg2NmU2">“Activities? Ha!” Serena’s laugh echoed in the large lobby, and Amelia wondered how uncomfortable the lift attendants were getting. “You mean looting and plundering out in international airspace?”</p>
<p class="cnNkM2I5ZTYzN2U0NzQ2M2ViNmE1ZGZjYjkzNGQzZDlj">“Speaker Halen, if you could refrain-”</p>
<p class="cnM5YzU2Y2YzYTE5MjQxOTU5MTcwNGZkOTliYzkxYWI3">“No. You listen here,” Serena jabbed a finger at the flustered receptionist. “House Halen and the owner are on good terms. We have hosted him as a guest in our estate many times. I will speak to him myself. Where is he?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDBhM2QwYzAxZTQzNzc4MGMzMjc3MjRjM2RjYzRj">“I cannot-”</p>
<p class="cnNmZWQ5YTcxMWEyZDQyNzJhZTcyNmUzNWY0ZTcwZDA1">“I was not <em>asking</em>,” Serena snarled, her voice abandoning all pretence of politeness. What a terrible hot-head she was! “I am <em>instructing you</em>. Tell me where I can find him, or you’ll experience some of that <em>conflict</em> you hope to avoid right here, right now!” The threat was punctuated with a crack as the edge of the receptionist desk Serena held splintered under her strength.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2YyMWU1YjhhYzQyZGU5MTQ4MTNjNGFjZmFlOTNm">As covertly as she could, Amelia twisted and turned the aether inside her and silently cast a little bit of ice magic. A wave of cold erupted from her, and the receptionist involuntarily shivered. Serena glanced in her direction, and Amelia responded to the questioning look with a small shrug.</p>
<p class="cnMyOWU3YWEzYTNhNjQ2MzI5Yzg2ZTk1MzI4Yzc5Zjk3">“T-there’s no need for that, Speaker Halen,” the receptionist blurted out, looking thoroughly intimidated at their joint attack. “Lord Yulan is recuperating in the penthouse suite. If you insist so strongly, then we have no choice…” the demon awkwardly gestured to the lift. “One of our attendants will take you there.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYmM2ZTUwNzNmOTQ4ZmRhNDQxYWU2N2E2ODNhMWZk">Serena held the man in her gaze as if glaring at him for long enough would melt him into a puddle. “Recuperating?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmMWU3NmM1YzkxZjRhNjhiYWMyY2IzZTkzOTRmMDI5">“Y-yes. He is… unwell.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NGYzYzk5NzdlZDQ0MzE5OGIyYjE0NDEyMjEzNGUx">Serena cast a side-eye at her. Amelia responded with a small nod to the implicit question. “Very well,” Serena intoned, “Shall we go see the owner, Miss Thornheart?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNWY4NTkwODE1MzQzZjA4NzA3YjMxZDc5MzYyMGZm">“Mmm, mmm! Sure thing!” Amelia nodded enthusiastically. Leaving the stressed receptionist behind, she and Serena entered one of the lifts and the attendant - who looked like he’d rather be anywhere else - produced a silver key from about his person. The attendant inserted the key into a keyhole and twisted three times. An audible click sounded and from below their feet there was a hiss of steam and the elevator began to trundle upwards.</p>
<p class="cnNkM2Q2ODk5NzZjODQ3ZGJhN2E4YmE1YjE4ODE5NGVi">The three of them stood in awkward silence. If they were alone, Amelia would have asked all kinds of questions but the presence of the lift attendant kept her lips closed.</p>
<p class="cnNiODNjZWYyNWI4OTQ2NTA5MzUxYWI4NjZiZjU4YWQ1">Another hiss of steam and the lift came to a halt outside a short hallway. The gates of the lift opened and for a moment everything seemed very still.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjRkMjNhNTNmNjQ2YWJhYzFkZWZkZWNhMjBlMGIy">“Let’s go,” Serena said, stepping out into the hallway. “Leave that here,” Serena gestured to the raincoats, hats, and gift bag containing the mask she was carrying. Amelia placed them on the floor to the side.</p>
<p class="cnNiODUwYWQxMmU2MjQzNjJhYzYwMWM1NDZjOGU1N2Fi">“Speaker Halen,” a small voice called out. It was the lift attendant, bowing deeply in Serena’s direction. “If you can do anything to help Lord Yulan’s position, many of us would be most grateful.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNGU4YTRkOTFkMTQ5ZTM5MTFlYjBmYjExZmIxNTEy">Serena evaluated the man with a cold gaze. “How long have you been under his employ?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZDA0MGYyYTk2ZDQ4OTNiM2NjYTgwMjFiZjAwOTQw">“Five years, Speaker Halen.”</p>
<p class="cnMwODM5ODJjZmIzOTQ0MGU5MDBhNzMzZmViMTJjZDk1">“How long has Lord Yulan been recuperating?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTEwNGE4OWVjOTQ0ODZiNDc3MWUwNmIyMmVjNmMx">“A little over a year now.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMTkzYTc3NDY5NDQ3MzZhN2Q5OTkzOGI5ODgwNjVl">“A year!” Serena exclaimed. “Who has been running Highguard in his place?”</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2I1MzJjMmQzMzQ1ZmM4OWEyOThlZjJlY2M2MWEz">“That would be his nephew, Manager San.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDkzZTdkYjk4MDRmMWU4OWFkMDgwZTE2NGVkOTcy">“Lord Yulan has a nephew?” Serena tilted her head in puzzlement. “I have never seen or heard of this nephew. Why?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNTQ3M2RhN2YzZjRhNTY4ZWRlYWZjYThiMjNmNTVi">“I can only repeat what I have heard but… <em>Manager San</em> was estranged from the family many years ago for eloping with an Ainese woman that Lord Yulan did not approve of. He recently reappeared to make amends with his uncle.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYWI5ODU0NWFmZjQxOTY5M2QyZTgwOGJkNDk4NmVi">“And was it this <em>Manager San</em> who was responsible for allowing that rabble in?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNmQ0YjIzNmYzYzRlODVhYTFlYmM1YmEyN2NlOGVj">“Yes, Speaker…” the lift attendant seemed to chew his words a little, “... Manager San appears to be close with their commander.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NWU5Y2FiMTUyNDRkNTM5NTkwYThjNjU0OGRhOTZh">Serena blinked a few times. “I see,” she said, “And when <em>exactly</em> did <em>Manager San</em> make his return?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMTE4ZDI3YWJiNzRiNDQ4NGFhMGZmY2Y0YjRjZWFl">“Ah…” The lift attendant kept his eyes firmly on the floor, a pained expression on his face. “That would be…” The demon's voice became barely a whisper, “... shortly before Lord Yulan became bedridden.”</p>
<p class="cnNlZDcxZThlZDkyMTQwYzhiOTkxOTAyNWJjOGIxNTZk">Serena closed the distance to the attendant and bent down so they were close. “Is the situation that bad?” She whispered.</p>
<p class="cnNkMmM3NGY4OTdmYjRiMjM4MTY2MDAwZGM3OWJkZTgx">“Cargo moves through the hotel only at night. Manager San and his allies monitor it. We are being replaced, one by one.” The lift attendant bowed deeply. “If you can do anything, I beg of you!”</p>
<p class="cnNiYzNlZWIwOGE1MzQ1MWJiOTFkYjgzNGEyNDNiYTMz">Serena straightened up slowly. “Will they be suspicious of you?”</p>
<p class="cnM1OTRhYTZlMzRlMjRmM2U5MzI0OTdkMTc4NWYyZjMy">“... Yes,” came the reply from the still-bowing attendant.</p>
<p class="cnM3MThlM2VkODVkNTQ1ZWI4MDY1YWM5YjI0Mzk5OTFm">“Then, you know what I must do? For your sake?” The attendant stood up, his mouth quivering, but Amelia could see the determination in his yellow eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNiZDI1NzdjYjQ4MjQ2OTI5YmU4ZTkwZjM3MmFiYzA1">“I am prepared, but if you could control your strength-” The man was cut short as Serena’s fist smashed into his face and blood exploded from his broken nose.</p>
<p class="cnM2YWFjMmVmZjEwMTRiMTFiZjQ0ZjA0YTY2YjgwNTY1">“Ahh… ahhh!” The man cried, clutching his bloody face.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTM3NmFkNzQzZjQzNmY4Yzk2NTAyYTk1ZmQ5NzRh">“Return below. Use all kinds of colourful language to describe me,” Serena’s voice took on a note of sympathy, “Describe my actions as violent and without restraint. Tell them I threatened your life with a sword. If you find the opportunity, exit the hotel. Hold this in your hand so it’s visible to the outside crowd.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzc3OWU2ZWIzMzRkNWVhNGExZjYyZDZhODBiZTU5">Serena reached into her pockets and pulled out a silver insignia identical to the one Tomes had given Amelia earlier. “You may or may not be approached by someone. Ask them if their accent is from Ichtaca, regardless of how they sound. If they say yes, then inform them that <em>Speaker Halen is exercising her privilege</em>. Is this understood?”</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2RkNWZhNmQwMjRjNjI5YzU2OTViMmNlZjllNjkx">“Ah… I understand, Speaker Halen!” The bloody attendant took the insignia and hid it in his sock. “I will do as you ask!” The man spoke with newfound enthusiasm that would look rather noble if he wasn’t pouring blood onto his uniform.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTU0M2E4MmVkMDQ0MjE5NTAxYmI3YTA1YzgzNGM1">“Is there any other way to access this floor?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzRmOTFjOGU2YTQwMGI5NWFlODliZjEyMWI3YjQw">“There are only the stairs. Right here.” The attendant pressed a bloody hand against the wall, and a mechanical click sounded as a section swung back, revealing a stairwell.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTJjNzBmZTNlMDQxZmE4ODNiOWJkNGI5NzZjMDM1">“Return this way. Go now. Be quick,” Serena ordered. The attendant gave a hasty bow and vanished down the stairwell. Amelia watched him go and listened as his footsteps quietened. She turned to Serena and raised her eyebrow as best she could.</p>
<p class="cnNiNGQzNzU2MTRjODRhODU5Yjg2MWQxYjRhZjMzYzFk">“Well, this has escalated rather quickly!” she said, forming her mouth into a sly grin. "How thrilling! What was all that about with the… you know?” Amelia motioned a punch with her fist.</p>
<p class="cnMxZGZmNDkwNjA5YzQ0OTJiZTIzNTVlZmY1ZmNlY2E2">“I merely want to give them pause in following us. If they believe I am out of control, they will be more hesitant. For some reason,” Serena sighed, “I have a reputation for being violent.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYzQwZDJlNDNiYzRjYWI5MjM1MDkwMmRlNWRhNzQ2">“Oh my!” Amelia made a mock expression of shock, “How could anyone have gotten that idea?”</p>
<p class="cnNlN2JlNjIxYzg0OTRjY2Y4NjE3ZGU4NjM0MDhjZjc5">“Shut up.”</p>
<p class="cnM0OTYwYTMxYjk3NjRjMDU5M2U3ZDhkOTNhNzU1OWI1">“Who is this Lord Yulan anyway?”</p><span class="cjhjOTNhZGQ2NWZlZTQyNGI4NDBjOTg5MmZiZjZkOTYz"><br/>Reading on this site? This novel is published elsewhere. Support the author by seeking out the original.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlMzQ1YzAyODc0MzQ5ZTY5NmYxNTdkZWIyYzI4YjBh">“He's a family friend. Growing up, I used to call him Uncle, and he used to call me <em>little Ren</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMTBjZGVmMjkzNjRiYmE5YzhhMzY1N2MxZDU5ZmM5">“Ren?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NDY0YzNmODY0ZjQzMDY5ZTJkYmUzYmJkMTdiYzMx">“Popular nickname for the name <em>Serena</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNhM2RkMDFhODYwNzQwODc5NDIyY2ZlNGY2NzYzOTJm">“Oh! I wonder what my nickname would be! Amelia… Amelia…” Amelia rolled her own name around her tongue, trying to come up with a suitable nickname. “Mel? Hmm, I don’t like that. Oh! I know! Lia! You can call me Lia if you like! What do you think?” She pumped her fist up and flexed her bicep. “Ren and Lia! Saving the world! Fighting against evil and corruption! Saviours of Highguard!”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDY1OTI4NjQyMTQ5MzliN2E2Y2M0ZWI1ODA3Mjg2">“What in the seven hells goes through your head, idiot!” Shaking her head and walking to the lift, Serena tried to hide it, but Amelia could see the smile.</p>
<p class="cnM3YmY0ZjAzZjE1YTRiOWU4NGYzNTEyOTQwMWU1M2Jl">She was going to ask, ‘<em>So what’s the plan, little Ren?</em>’ but caught herself just in time. She was very happy with their relationship's direction and didn’t want to push things too fast. Luckily, little Ren answered the question herself.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjFhYmY1MTRjZjRkMjU5ODAzMGY5ZGM4YzIxM2I2">“First, I’ll break the lift so they cannot interrupt my investigation,” Serena said.</p>
<p class="cnM1NGUyYmM0NzUzYjQzZDViMGNkZjExMGVlNWFjMWY4">“How are you-”</p>
<p class="cnMzOWRlZGU0MjAxYTRjMjM5Zjg3ODAxYmU0YTBhNDFj">Serena's fist smashed through the wooden and marble wall, ripping through copper pipes that spewed out boiling hot steam. Serena herself seemed unaffected by the heat and continued wreaking havoc on the steam system that operated the lift. A few moments later, the fully functioning lift became a twisted wreck.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmFjYWVkOTQ0MDRjZGU5YWNiNmZiNzRjOWE1MGZk">Amelia clapped her hands quickly. “How educational!” She flashed a smug grin at Serena. “I’m learning a lot from you about how to solve future problems! This etiquette lesson is very engaging! Pfft!” She couldn't resist a giggle at the end, the humour of her own joke too much for her to keep the act up.</p>
<p class="cnMwMGQ4ODZkODgyNTQ1MjdhZDFiMmVhMWI2ZmYzYTU2">Serena rolled her eyes but didn’t chastise her. “Secondly,” Serena said, “I’ll stop them coming through here, at least until they find enough muscle.” Serena closed the hidden door to the stairs and placed a hand on the marble. Amelia sensed the aether inside Serena bubble before the marble melded together, sealing the hidden door shut.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTNiNjRkZjNmYTQwZTU4OTk0ZDU4NGQ2MDljZWQx">“I didn’t know you knew earth magic!” She exclaimed.</p>
<p class="cnM1YWNlM2FhN2MxNDQ2Y2ViYzc0ZmZiNDJhYmU4MTRj">“There’s a lot of things you don’t know about me.” Came the reply.</p>
<p class="cnM2YWNjMTdjMGNjMTQzM2ZiNjJhY2ZjOTM0NWJjMmRh">“Mmm! I can’t wait to find them all out!” She leaned against the wall, folded her arms and mustered her cheekiest grin. “Any more cute nicknames I should know about?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMzg2M2EwMWExYjRiZjc4ZTU2MjMwNDE0Njc0N2Uy">Serena didn’t reply, but the marble in the wall flowed like liquid forming a sword in the shape of a katana.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTYzNDUxZDc2NTQyODU5OGExMjIzY2NlYjFhMWU1">“You’re not going to stab me with that, are you?” Amelia asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="cnNkOTgyOTEzODZkOTRkMmI5NzMyYzRhOGRhMTRkNTYz">“I’ll stab you later. Let’s go. Observe and be ready for a fight.” Serena brandished the marbled katana, testing out its weight with a few test swings.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGIyMDk3MzcxNjRiNjI5YmI5Y2UzNzg0ZGI0MDgy">“Okay! But you know… I don’t really want to fight. I can sit there and tank a lot of hits, though!”</p>
<p class="cnNjZTllM2JmYWRhODRkZmE5NzJiYTc1N2MyOTliOWU0">“You can <em>what</em> a lot of hits?” Serena asked, stopping mid-swing and looking confused.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjNhNTNjZDg2MjQ5MDU5MjU0Y2YwNjkzMzNlNjZm">“Umm…” Amelia paused, realizing she had used another expression from her world. “Do you not have… tanks? Big armoured land machines? With a big gun?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTQ2MTRiMWEwODQ4YTJhMzg5YzdlMWJiNjU0NGQy">“No, why would anyone use that?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTI3YzFiZWJhMjQ3OWI4MDVkYzczZGU3N2JiMmMx">“To like… you know,” Amelia shuffled her feet awkwardly. She wasn’t a military expert! “Protect the infantry and stuff…”</p>
<p class="cnNhYTUzZDk2NGJkZTQwMjlhOWQyYTU5ZWI5OTE5NTRm">“Protect the infantry? Surround the men in an armoured box?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MjFhYjEwYTlhNzRlY2Q5OGUwOGE1MmUxOWUxYWUx">“That’s right!”</p>
<p class="cnMxOGY1MGZiNjhkYTQ2YWZiOGMyZjhlMTdhZGE5ZjFi">“Add in a big gun to aid in their defensive and offensive capability?”</p>
<p class="cnM4YjhhNjM3MzQ4YTQ5NmI5M2EyM2MxZTljZjI1MTll">“Yeah!”</p>
<p class="cnNjMjBiOTc2YzRjNjQ1NDE5OWM5YzQ0YjM2ZGNhOTRi">“And then, because it would weigh so much, install a lift engine to counter the weight of the armour?”</p>
<p class="cnNlYjE3OTZjYmNmZTRjYTViMjA1Nzc5MTkyMzk0N2I2">“I suppose so…”</p>
<p class="cnMwZGNmM2NiNGY4MzRlOTc4N2Q5ZmFkZjU2NGQ4OWRm">“Congratulations. You’ve just reinvented the warship. I’ll make sure to recommend you to Centralis High Command, <em>Lia</em>.” A sly smile appeared on Serena’s face, and Amelia felt her mouth open in shock. The audacity! She made sure her cheeks were thoroughly puffed out, and she strode up to the smug demon and tried to look as threatening as possible, which considering how unbelievably cute she was, can’t have been very much.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTAxMTkyNWEzNDQ3YmI4OGE2MzU5YzU3ZjA5MzM1">“You! You-” She was cut short and suddenly felt all her anger melt away as she felt her hair being ruffled. Her hair was being ruffled! What a pleasant feeling!</p>
<p class="cnNlYWUyZWU4ZmEyYjQ3NzRhYWRhNzhiYTM0NTRjYzE0">“Come on, idiot. We’ve dallied around long enough,” Serena said, removing her hand. Amelia looked at the hand longingly for a moment before remembering herself.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTUzZjJjMjM1MDRlYTNiMDgwMzQ4YzYxMzYzZDg2">“Okay!”</p>
<p class="cnNiNDRjZDIzMWYwMzQwZTRhMWMzMzQ1NWY4ZDk1MThh">They moved down the hallway and rounded the corner into a dimly lit foyer. The floor was embedded with polished jade tiles. Wooden screens - intricately carved with stylized animals - lined the walls. A clockwork bronze dragon formed the centrepiece of the room. The clicking and turning of the cogs caused it to sway its ornately constructed head left and right. Two glowing amber eyes seemed to stare at them.</p>
<p class="cnNiODM2NTJlOWE3ZTQ2YjZhOGYyMWUwYjI5ZGZkYWVh">“Wow…” Amelia muttered, taking in the grand sculpture.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTRiNmVhOGViMTQyZmM5ZmFiMzU1ZDBhYzIzNjA5">“It’s…” Serena paused, “I’ve forgotten its name, but it’s one of the more powerful kami worshipped by the Quintists. It’s a fire kami, taking the form of one of the fabled great lizards.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMmJlYjMwZTEzNjQzMTM5MTljNWQ1OWJmMmYyMjRj">“So cool! Hey, those aren’t aetherlights!” She pointed to the brass gas lamps lining the walls and hanging from the ceiling. They gave the room a feeling of warmth with their soft light.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzFkMDA4ZWE2YzRiNjFiOWNkMTE5OTQ3NWIyNDI5">“Lord Yulan is old-fashioned,” Serena explained. She looked around for a moment before striding off towards a set of stairs that led to a sliding door. With a moment of hesitation, she gripped the sword and flung the door open. From within the dark room, nothing came. As Amelia focused, she could hear the soft breathing of another person.</p>
<p class="cnM2NzBkMTllMDA1ZTQ2OTY5Nzk3NTMyMDMzNWRjYjBl">Serena flicked a switch on the wall, and the room was illuminated by a number of gas lamps flaring into life. The bedroom was dominated by a four-poster bed with a high canopy of red silk. An old demon with grey hair and great horns lay sleeping.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDhkMjU3M2M0NTRlOWRhMzI4ZDE1NzQ5ZDA0OGEw">“Lord Yulan…” Serena whispered softly. “Come in, it's clear,” she said, motioning to Amelia, who stepped into the room. She had to navigate the floor as it was strewn with scrolls depicting artwork and Manwese scripture. Against one wall, there was an altar burning incense with carved sculptures of strange creatures that Amelia assumed were kami.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTUxNzRjYzFhYjRjNWQ4ZWYxOTU4ZmM0NTViYzFm">Hanging from the ceiling were dozens of pieces of paper with strange symbols painted on in black ink. These were also pinned on the bed's wood and seemingly randomly on the walls. Good luck charms, she guessed, or perhaps wards against evil spirits or kami.</p>
<p class="cnMxMWE5ZjkxODJiZTRlNDQ5MTMzMGNjZWE5YjcyODJi">“He doesn’t look great…” Amelia said. Lord Yulan was breathing weakly, and his face was painted with a pained expression.</p>
<p class="cnNiMzRiNWUyZjc4YzRjYWU4N2I4NmUyNTM0MGEzMDNl">“No. He doesn’t,” Serena said, moving to the edge of the bed and digging through the contents of the bedside table. Dozens of bowls and vials lay haphazardly stacked, containing an assortment of incense, herbs and strange-coloured tinctures. Serena smelled a few, a frown appearing. “These are traditional Manwese remedies. They are for inducing sleep and… oh, I see.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNTI3NDg2ZDEwYTQ2YmY4MzFiODc5MzI5N2UxZjcx">Amelia watched as Serena found a vial containing a fine blue dust. “What’s that?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTM1MGQ5MGI4MTRiN2VhZjQwNDYyNTg1YTE4NDAw">“Dust,” Serena answered. “Finely ground moon crystal that is baked for a long time and then ground even further.” She looked sympathetically at Lord Yulan. “It can be ingested or smoked to alleviate mental and physical pain, but it is highly addictive.” Serena opened a drawer and pulled out a smoking pipe. She smelt it before turning her head in disgust.</p>
<p class="cnNjMjZiYjQ4MmVlYTQ1NzY4NzlmNmI0MTc0NDNlNGI0">“They did this to him,” she muttered. “Induced addiction and then used the excuse of caring for him to put him into a comatose state. Took control of the hotel.” She shook her head, eyes reflecting sadness and anger. “They would have slipped it into his food at first. Lord Yulan has… had a strong mind. He would not have become like this of his own will.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNzdkMjY2N2ZhODQxNjA4NmYyNTg3MjBkZmRmNjBj">Serena pocketed the vial of dust, tobacco pipe and some other articles. She turned to Amelia with a complicated expression on her face. “I know… it’s not part of your contract but-”</p>
<p class="cnNkZTM4MDE1Mzk0NzQ4ZDVhNWUxYTVhZTg2MzZhZjg3">“Say no more!” Amelia replied, giving her a reassuring double thumbs up as she began glowing and bathing the room in gold. The brilliant light - with flecks of blue - flowed from her into the air and into Lord Yulan’s body. The demon glowed for a dozen seconds before it finally dimmed, and the room returned to normal.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzIzZGEyZDA2OTQ0ZTJhZGY2ZWIzZmI4MTkwZTA3">All was quiet for a moment as Lord Yulan’s breathing sounded deep and healthy. His expression became relaxed, and a peaceful smile was on the old man’s face as he slept deeply. Also, he was… he was…</p>
<p class="cnNmMTgzNjNmNzEyZTRkNzI5NTc4NDcwM2Y4ZjdlNGFj">Snoring.</p>
<p class="cnNjMjAwYTMyNzc0NTQ1YTdhZTE5M2VhNGIxOGMxYTYy">“Seems like it worked,” Amelia said, shrugging. Serena frowned at the sleeping man before clicking her tongue, lifting her leg high and giving Lord Yulan a wicked kick!</p>
<p class="cnNhZTVkODJlNGExNDQyMTZiOWRjMTY0Njg2MmVmNWYy">“Wake up, you useless old fart!” She yelled, giving him another boot.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWQ3OTlmNmI1NTRkMDZhZDFkN2YwOTgxMzBkMDFl">“Argh! What the! Who dares!” The old demon frantically sat up, glaring at Serena before his eyes slowly widened in surprise. “Serena? Seven hells! Is that you!?”</p>
<p class="cnNmODA2ZmQ1N2M2NjRhZjFiYWFmZGU3Y2Q1ZDkxN2Rj">“How are you feeling, you damned old man?” Serena said, folding her arms and looking thoroughly annoyed.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzhiMjIwZjM2NTQ5MzY5MTlhNzMwNWI4YTQwZjYx">“I feel… wonderful. Serena! What are you doing here!?” Lord Yulan's crimson eyes narrowed and then opened again in surprise when he noticed Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjRhMTY2ZGFlODQ3MTZhNDMxYWUwNjc5MDg2Yjdi">“Hi! Nice to meet you!” Amelia gave him a small wave.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTJlZjVjZWI2ZTQ2OTZiZGVkMDU2ZWFjMjg4ZmEy">“Who… who’s this human? Serena! What’s going on!?”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjdlMTg2MTFkODQzMzU5MDg3YThlYzBlYTQ4NzAy">“This here is Miss Thornheart under my employ.” Serena put an arm around Amelia’s shoulders and pulled her close. Amelia did everything she could not to squeak an embarrassing sound. Her cheeks felt red hot, and she forced herself to look away so Serena couldn’t see her face.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzgxNTBkYzEyOTQxZmJiNjM0NGQ5YmU0MjdlOGUz">“She's a human healer and has healed you under my instruction,” Serena continued.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmQ1OWIyMGQ2NTRmN2M4MWVlNjczYzA2OTBiMTJm">Lord Yulan blinked for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTRjZjA1MmZiYTQ3YWNhMmRkNTY2MzM1MDc5MmVj">“A human healer!” He exclaimed, “Since when did House Halen manage such a feat!”</p>
<p class="cnM2OThmZTc3YmJhNTRjNjBhNWI3YjJlZjY2MmQ5MTdl">“Since recently. She’s under <em>my</em> employ. My personal retinue. She is not under the control of my father.” Serena took a breath. “She is also a Speaker, so be respectful.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MGIwNDBiOTNiZjRkYmRhOGUxNmU2NGY1Y2U5Yjlh">“A Speaker! She is so young!” Lord Yulan suddenly narrowed his eyes. “Serena, have you considered-”</p>
<p class="cnMyYzQ4Nzg3YTIyZTQxMjQ4YTM0YmQ5NzRiMWViOGNm">“She is not a darkblade. I’ve verified it.”</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2VkOWUyMTVhNzRkNTI4YWRkYWZiM2FkNGVkY2Nl">“Where does she hail from!?”</p>
<p class="cnNjYTE0YWQ4N2JhZDQ5MGNiMjI2MTYwODhjYzJlZTk1">“It’s complicated, and we have more important manners to discuss. Can we move the conversation along, old man?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OWMwMmZhNjNmMjQ3NWQ4NWY5NDA5NDE0MjJlNjNj">Lord Yulan stared at Amelia for a little longer. It was rather awkward, so she gave him a small smile. “My deepest gratitude, young human, for the aid you have rendered upon me. House Yulan will not forget what has transpired here today…”</p>
<p class="cnM4NmI0MDY5ZGJhZjRlMjJiM2UxMWYyN2ZkYzc3MmQ0">“You’re welcome! I’m always happy to help Serena out!” Amelia exclaimed with a bigger smile. “Besides, this will help me get a raise,” she turned to look at Serena, oozing smugness as she took the opportunity. “Right, <em>Ren</em>?”</p>
<p class="cnNlYTRhODJjYzUzYjQ0NDQ5MTIzN2UxMjZlZmM1NzFi">Oh dear! What a super-effective attack! Serena’s cheeks bloomed with redness, and she looked thoroughly stricken with embarrassment! Success!</p>
<p class="cnNiZTQwNzhiNWZkODQzODQ4NDcxOGNjZTNiNmI1NWU2">“You… you idiot! Don’t call me that!”</p>
<p class="cnNjYTRhODJhMjk2ODRjYTNhNWFmOTY4MjgwOGZmMWJk">“You’re blushing!”</p>
<p class="cnNlZGM5NmU5NjkxYjRjNDJiMGE4YmY0OWRlNTdjNGFh">“So are you!”</p>
<p class="cnMwOWFkNWE5ZjgxOTRhZTRiYjFkOGM0YjlmOTU2ODc5">“Ah! I forgot! Don’t look at me!” Amelia turned, hiding her flushed face from Serena again.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2Y1ZDk5YjVjZDQ2Y2ZiYWQzMTRmZjczODNiNmJk">Lord Yulan looked between them for a few seconds. “It appears you’ve made a friend, Serena?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjBjMGMzMjkwNjQ3OTk4MDZhNmZmMWE5MTQ4NjRm">“I…” Serena began, “Damn it! This is a conversation for another time. Look here, old man! This is what they were giving you.” She produced the tobacco pipe and vial of Dust, handing them to the bewildered Lord Yulan.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDVmNTkwOTU0MDQxYzg5NGIwYmM4OTk4ZTM2NDYx">“This is… Dust, isn’t it?” he asked, turning the vial against the light.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjRlMmQ2OWZmMTQ0ZGRiYjEwMWFmMmU0NjJmMDFl">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZGNhYWQ5MmIwNTRjYmE4YmQ0N2FmOGYxZjIzZTNh">Lord Yulan looked around the room, taking in the mess. “How long have I been here?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MWVlOTk4OGRhNDQzNWVhYzZmYTc0NzRmNWEyOThk">“About a year, your lift attendant told us. Some in the hotel appear to still be loyal to you. We were told it was the work of your dear <em>nephew,</em> someone with the surname <em>San</em>."</p>
<p class="cnMwMmI0YjJhNjcyMzRkYmVhZDQ0OGIyNTE3YTk4MjIw">“That…” Lord Yulan stared off into space for a moment. “That bastard! I welcomed that snake back into the family! I still see he’s the same conniving son of a-” The old man caught himself, coughing into his hand awkwardly. “Apologies Serena, Speaker Thornheart. I’ve lost myself in my emotions.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNmU3MGU5ZDc0YTRlNmJiMzYyZTMxODNjZmMzYmQ2">“No need, that bastard has welcomed the <em>Crimson Reapers</em> into the hotel. He seems to be working with them on some kind of smuggling activity. Could be weapons, could be drugs. He’s using your hotel in some way to hide or sell the goods. Also, the twerp seems to have instituted a segregationist policy in the hotel, something I took <em>particular</em> exception to.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMTFmMTQ3MzVlYzQzYTI5M2EyNWVkZWUzM2E5ZDRj">“Seven hells!” Lord Yulan exclaimed. “Where is he now!?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MDNkMDQ1ZDVhYjRhZTM5YTMxNDQ2OWVjZWZmYTZj">Serena shrugged. “I don’t know. I caused a scene down at reception and demanded to see you. Forced my way here and then broke the elevator and blocked the stairs. I imagine it won’t be long till they try and force their way through.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ODAyM2JjNTIzNDRmNTk5ODFkODMwNGY4YmY4NmY4">“Surely they won’t try and fight you?” He turned his eyes towards Amelia. “Fight you both? You’re both Speakers!”</p>
<p class="cnMxMTdjODAzZDEyMTRjMDQ5Y2FhZDIzZWJlOWYxNDc2">“I don’t know what they’ll have planned, but it won’t be good. I suspect they have law enforcement under their thumb and will try and cause a scene to make it look bad for us. Frame this as a kidnapping or something…”</p>
<p class="cnMwNmMwYTM1ZWFjZTRkZjBiM2FhZDE4NTVkMDQzMTNk">“Kidnapping!? What do you intend to do with me?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMzllOThlNGU2ZjRmYjE5ODQ2ZmJjYmYzYjU0ZGE4">“Get you out of here. There’s a squad from Centralis Intelligence following us. I’ll make contact and hand you over… and then…” Serena looked up as a smile formed on her face.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzI4ODYzN2Q0YTQwZDA4ZmY0NmM0NGY4NzEzMzZj">“You have that look on your face again, Serena,” Lord Yulan said.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGYxNWQzZGJhMTRiODJhNmRhNjMyYjA0MTU5OTY5">“What look!?”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmRjZWUzMzUzYTQ5Yjg5ODU2NmRhYTM0MzU5Mjk4">“... Nothing.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTUzNzdjYjkyYjQ5NDA5ZWFlZDQ3NzgzYTgzNzZm">“Tsk! Anyway, you old man, let’s get you out of here. Do you want to change first?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMGJjNzAxZTZiNzQzZTRhZWJiZGFiMTVhOGEyNzgz">“Yes, of course! I can’t be seen like this. One minute, ladies!” Lord Yulan jumped up with a sudden bout of energy and began rummaging in a wardrobe for some clothes. “I feel brilliant! What wonderful healing abilities you have mastered, young Speaker Thornheart!”</p>
<p class="cnNlNmVjYTcxZWJlMTRlZTA4YWIyZjc3ZGJiMjVjOGI1">“You’re welcome!” Amelia grinned. She decided she very much liked being called <em>Speaker Thornheart</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM5MGJmN2UzYjM4ZDRhZmM4ZGY4YzIwMWJmZjNjYzcw">Lord Yulan stepped behind a paper screen and soon reappeared in a smart suit. “I’m ready, Serena. What now?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NGVlODg5NmE1NTQ4OTRhOGRmYWU4NDE0MmQ5YmY1">“Can you still maintain the first aura?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjUwOTRjZTA0ZTQ1MGJiMGYwNTlkYWQ1ZDYwZjVk">“Hmm…” Lord Yulan closed his eyes and after a moment his body began to glow with hues of red. “That was easier than I thought! It has been years since I last did this!”</p>
<p class="cnMyMzRlZTM2MGY4NTQ2YjE4OWUyY2RjZmMwMjA4MzM0">“Excellent,” Serena strolled across the room, pulling down the shuttered blinds. Daylight flooded the bedroom and from beyond the window the streets of Kenhoro were sprawled out. The urban expanse was sprinkled with towering pagodas and in the distance Amelia could make out the triple steel lighthouses of the Imperial docks.</p>
<p class="cnNiYjY2MjhjODdlZTQxY2FiMGM3MjZhNmNjODE4NDYy">Serena coated her marble katana with an orange aura before stabbing it through the window frame, cutting out the window in its entirety like a jigsaw piece. The window fell inwards, and Serena caught it and let it down gently.</p>
<p class="cnM2YmEzNWYxNTNjODQ5N2M4OGEyM2JlNDlmNTcxZGE5">A breeze filled the room, and paper began flapping all over. Amelia gulped nervously. Surely she didn’t mean…</p>
<p class="cnMwMjE2MTVmMzQ3YTQ3YWJhMzdlMDYzNTEyODFiNzFj">“Ready?” Serena asked the room.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTQ4N2RlNTE0YjQwMTZhYzAxMmZhZTc1MDg4M2Vk">“How thrilling!” Exclaimed Lord Yulan, rolling his glowing red shoulders. “I feel young again!”</p>
<p class="cnM0ODEyMmM0OTAyNjQyYjFhYTFiZDNlZTVmMGVkMTAw">“Are you <em>crazy</em>!?” Amelia spluttered. “We’re going to <em>jump</em>!?” She tiptoed to the edge of the room and peered out. Her stomach twisted into knots as she felt a queasy feeling rising. They were maybe twenty floors up, and the people below looked like ants.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWMyZTI2YjFkYjRhM2M5N2UxYzBiMmU2ZTAxMTdl">“What’s the problem?” Serena asked. “A jump like this is easy for a first-level aura or ward, right?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNWQyYWNlY2E3MzQ2Mzc4YTgxZGJiYWFkNTZmNTYy">“I’ve changed my mind,” Amelia said, “I’ve decided I very much prefer fighting and all that! Let’s go back the way we came and fight our way down!”</p>
<p class="cnM1YWE1ZDRhOWNmNjRjNDJiOTlhNTcwNzE2NDU1YWNi">“Are you… scared of heights?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZThjNmYwOWUzZjQ3NjA5ZTIwYjA2OGY3NzE1NDBh">“No! Yes! I don’t know! It just feels weird!”</p>
<p class="cnNkMDRkNGQ0ZDI4ZTRjYzVhMTBmMmFjZmUxMjg2MGM0">“Have no fear, young Speaker! Look!” Lord Yulan appeared at the edge with them. “The outside seating is unoccupied! We can aim there!”</p>
<p class="cnMwZGRjYjk1ZjhmMzQyZWFhODJiM2RiYTk0ZDMxY2Mw">“I…” Amelia tried to desperately calm her frantic heart. “I… I can only do it if you hold my hand!” She cried out, causing Serena to open her eyes in shock.</p>
<p class="cnM4NmNlMGI4ZTMyODRlZDc4M2RhNTdkOTA5ZWM5NjM2">“What? Why?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNDkxZmMyNTY5MDRiNTE4NTQ3ODQyOTI2NzY4OTZi">“I can’t do it any other way! I’m too scared! I feel like crying!” Oh, now she had actually started to cry. She was trying her best! She could do it! She would be brave like Serena always was, confident and self-assured!</p>
<p class="cnNjYzM1ZmViNWM0ZDQxZjY4MjFlZGJkNzFlYjRkNDE1">As long as Serena held her hand!</p>
<p class="cnNjYWM2OGZiZWUwYzQzYjJiZTJlM2ZiZjE3ZmI1NjM3">“You’re a very weird human, aren’t you?” Lord Yulan said, a sparkle in his eye. “Well, Serena? Your <em>friend </em>requests your assistance and I can’t keep my aura going all day!”</p>
<p class="cnM1YmU1YzE1ZDI1ZTRhODA4MGM4NzQ3YTViNjA4Mjkw">“... Fine. Fine!” Serena grabbed her hand, wrapping it in warmth and comfort. “Here. Don’t squeeze too tight! Remember to bend your legs when we land.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDI4ZDlmYzRlNDQ2YTlhNTlkY2RkMmFkNzEzNTYy">“Oh, okay!” Amelia pushed down the knot in her throat. Everything would be okay as long as she held Serena’s hand.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTMxYjNlMTA1ZjRhNzRhMDJiYzVkYWM2NzVmM2E0">“The wind will be loud as we fall. Oh, don’t scream or yell; it will draw more attention than we need.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NjMyYjRlZWI2NDQxZmRhNGY2ZjhmMGRjMTU2MWVl">“O-okay!”</p>
<p class="cnMzNGNhMzc0NzIwYjQ4YzFiYmJkMzRkMzczODIxNmI1">“Are you ready?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMzUxMzZjMDM2YzQ0YzZiNWQ4NzQ4NjlmMDBjODZm">“I… I think so!”</p>
<p class="cnMwNTQ3M2IxZTVjNzQyZmE5MjM2NWFkM2ZlOTc4MTc3">“Good. We’ll aim for the far side of the seating area. Old man, you aim for the side closest to us, alright?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NTk4ZmEyY2E2MzQxZWFiZGEzZTMwNmZmMDM3ODU2">“You got it!” Lord Yulan rubbed his hands together eagerly.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzcwN2FhMzVkMjQ2Y2M5YThhZjRjNDhhNTEwZGNi">“Amelia, in three?”</p>
<p class="cnM4YWVkM2M3MWNkODQ0MDY5Njg2YzAyYjhkNWFjZmE2">“Three?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NzNiMTQ4ZWI2NDRkMmRhMGExN2I0NGQ2MThkZDlj">“Two!”</p>
<p class="cnNmMTNmNGIxOTdlMTRjYzFiZDAwNDQ0ZWRiMzQyN2I4">“Two!?”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDQzYzk2NGYzMzQ4MjFhZjdiMjRjYmYzOTY2MDU0">“One! Jump!”</p>
<p class="cnM2OTI3Yzk0OTIwZjRiNmJiY2MzMWE2Yzc1Y2YyMDEw">“Ah!”</p>
<p class="cnM0YzE4YmYzZGY3NzRlODU4M2ZhMGYwNTAzNDFjZjg3">They leapt from the building, and despite Serena’s stern instructions…</p>
<p class="cnMyNTZjYTUzNjk4MjRlNDBiNTBjZTU1ODQwNjkyODQ1">Amelia screamed.</p>

      <description>Chapter Seventeen: Coffee Before The Storm</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNmMDM2YzliZjA2ZDQ0Mzc4YWUxNTMzMDg4MzJiYTVh"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM4MWQ4NDk5YjVlYzQ5NTNiNWIyZjA3ZmU2YzZmNTIz">As they plummeted down, the wind roared in Serena’s ears and Amelia's grip almost crushed her hand that was covered in second-level aura. Seven hells! The human was strong when she wanted to be! The ground rushed up to meet them and Serena smashed through a wooden table, denting the stone floor underneath and throwing up dust and splinters.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTRiMGU3NDNjYzQwZTdiOTM4NDEzZTdkMzE5MGRk">To her right, Amelia had somehow gone through the table head first, face-planting the stone floor. Her legs wiggled in the air and she was making weird whimpering noises. Serena removed her hand from Amelia’s crushing grip and pulled the struggling human upwards by her ankle.</p>
<p class="cnNiZmY4ZDBiOGZiZjQ2OTU5NzdiYjZjNWU0MTM0Zjc5">“That was amazing!” An upside-down Amelia exclaimed when her face appeared. “Can we do it again!? Oh my, the adrenaline rush! I feel wonderful!” Serena rolled her eyes and opened her hand, letting Amelia fall into a crumpled heap. At least the idiot was okay.</p>
<p class="cnNiOGU0NzBhM2QwYTQ4ODlhNzI0YzhlNzBjMTY1YTgx">“Old man?” She called out, turning to see Lord Yulan clamber smoothly out of a bed of soil and plants. She wasn’t sure how it was possible to look dignified in such a situation, but Lord Yulan managed it. He dusted his legs and adjusted his shoes before rubbing his knees.</p>
<p class="cnMwMzEyYmY0NDQ0MDRlODU5ZjY1ZjBkNDI1YzBiYmVm">“A little hard on my joints, but I still have it in me, Serena!” Lord Yulan’s face broke out in a proud smile as he crossed his arms and straightened his posture. “These old horns still have some fight left in them! Hmm…” He narrowed his eyes at the pile of blond hair and limbs. “Is your human alright?”</p>
<p class="cnMwYjBhZjk2YjI5NDQ3YjE5MDcxMzA5YTUwNGFiNzNj">“She’s fine,” answered Serena, climbing out of the wooden table. A crowd of market-goers had started to form. Amelia’s screaming certainly hadn’t helped reduce their attention.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjcwMmY5ZGVlODQzOGFiNWNiY2Y1YTU1ZWQ2ZjI0">“Dear, do you think they’re okay!?”</p>
<p class="cnM4MGI4OWJiMTM1NDQzOTI4YmQ2ZjEyNzkyMTgzZTAz">“Must be pretty skilled to survive a fall like that!”</p>
<p class="cnNiOGE0ZTUwMzdiZDQ4NWVhYTIzM2JhYzk1NjBkNzIy">“They didn’t fall, they jumped! I saw it!”</p>
<p class="cnM2M2QyOGNjNDM1MTRjMzA5Mzg4YzUwZDc3YWViNDQ2">“Seven Hells! That’s Speaker Halen! The captain in the news!”</p>
<p class="cnM1MzQ4NDk4MWU4YjQ0MzFhY2VjMWNiYzgzMDg4Zjkw">“Come on,” Serena said, helping Amelia stand. The trio pushed their way through the crowd, and after turning a few corners, they escaped from prying eyes. Behind them, the piercing sounds of whistles blown by the city guard could be heard. Serena guided the pair into a quieter part of the city before dipping into an empty cafe at the end of an alley. She shut the door behind them and turned the closed sign around.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzQ1NmYwZjFkYzRlMWJiNTg2YjJmODVkODBlNDUx">Two young demons in work uniforms stood awkwardly behind the counter, watching Serena. One of them was casting a nervous look at her captain's uniform and marbled sword, while the other stared at her with wonder.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzBjMWE5ZDk3ZDQyYmViN2E4ZmVhMGNlYTIyMmNi">“It’s Captain Halen! The war hero!” The teenage demon spluttered. He gave a shoddy but enthusiastic salute. “It’s an honour to meet you! Bless the seven hells!”</p>
<p class="cnNhNjJhODNkNTYwYTRlOWI5ZGJhZWYyNTgyMWQyZjQ2">“You are… students?” She asked, eyeing the both of them carefully.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTkxNDJkZmU0ODQyOTNhNmE2YzgzMDQ3ZWNmNGRh">“Yes, Captain! I’m Trainee Yin, and this,” he elbowed his nervous-looking colleague, “Is Trainee Meng! We’re second-years at the academy! You’re a legend amongst the officer staff, Captain!”</p>
<p class="cnNiNzlmMWI0OWJlNzRiOGQ4ZWQ1ZDdhM2YzZjVjODM1">“Is that so? Well then, Trainee Yin, would you be able to do me a favour?” The youthful face lit up as he beamed with sudden pride.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjViZTIxYjJiZTRjMTNiZTZiNjllMTU5YmI5N2Ji">“Of course, Captain!”</p>
<p class="cnM0NWE3ZGZiYTc1ZTRhYjE4ODlkMDE1M2NiNGFjZjcy">“My friends and I require some privacy. Would you and trainee Meng make yourself scarce for the time being?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNmE4NDc1OGE2ZDQ3NmFiMDMxMzBiNDQ5ZGFiMGYy">“Y-Yes! We can do that!”</p>
<p class="cnM3OWI5NzRjMjI1NzQzODFhODFmMDkyNWU0MGQyOWY5">“Before you go, is there anyone else in the building?” Serena asked, noticing a door behind the two employees.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2ZjZTA0YjM0ZDQ0NjE4NDQ2ODM5MmJiZTI3MmMz">“No one else! The boss won’t be back until the end of the day.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OGY4OGE2NDlmYTQ3N2Q5NzhhZGUyYjBiMjU2YzJl">“Good. Now take this…” Serena fumbled about in the pockets of her uniform. She was looking for her family insignia but she had already given it out to the hotel employee. “Amelia,” she called out, “Do you have the Halen insignia on you?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZGZjODM3ZWM1YTQ5Zjg4NWFhNzE1OGVkMDU5ZWFi">“Mmm! Of course! I’ll never take it off!”</p>
<p class="cnM4MzkxMTg2ZGQ4MDRjNTFhNWE3ODUyMTBiN2JmNTdj">“Well, take it off now. I need it.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzIwMTE1ZGJiNTQ5NGZiZmEyYjU3MTlkZGNlNWQ0">“Aww, alright.” Amelia pulled at her neck and removed the necklace she had fashioned from the insignia and a piece of string. Serena took it, pausing slightly at feeling how <em>warm</em> the metal was. Warm from Amelia’s body heat.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzUzYjA1OTRiMjQ2ZGFiNzEyMjk5NDNjNWY2N2E2">She cursed quietly. She needed to sort through this bizarre and unnatural attraction that was building. She let her eyes wander over the girl's face for a moment. Amelia was a friend, and that was all she needed to be. A beautiful and annoying friend… with soft pink lips that-</p>
<p class="cnM3YzMxZjYwZDczNTRiYmU4OTY0YzFkMjIwM2UzMmRh">“Tsk! Idiot!” She muttered.</p>
<p class="cnMyN2FjMDlhMGRiODQ3MWU4YzliNThhYTVlOTk2ZjA3">“I didn’t do anything!” Amelia protested, puffing her cheeks out.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTIxZDQ0MWE5YjQyNWI5ZTJmMDc3NTIzMmNhNTNh">“Not you,” she said, shaking her head. This time, she was the idiot for getting distracted and letting her mind think about such… inappropriate things.</p>
<p class="cnMwOGZlZjA2NmMwYjQ0NjBhOTEwY2UwMTc1OWY3OTdj">“Trainee Yin. Take this and stand at the edge of the street. Hold it so it’s visible to the passing crowd. If you’re approached by somebody, ask them if their accent is from Ichtaca, no matter what they sound like. If they answer yes, then point them to this cafe. Do you understand?”</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2Y4MGFlNWY1MzRjYTVhZTVlNDE0MTRmYmNiNzFj">“Understood, Captain!” Another shoddy salute.</p>
<p class="cnNlODIwY2MyMTIwNDQ5Mjk5NjA3YWU2ODkxNmZjN2Rh">“And sort your salute out, Trainee. Like this,” Serena saluted the youth with all the experience and practice of the seasoned captain she was. The boy looked like he could die happy.</p>
<p class="cnNmZWZhM2ZlZTNhNDRjYmY4ZTUwNTcyODY4Y2FiNTll">“Yes, Captain! I’ll practice all night!”</p>
<p class="cnNiOGRhNmEzY2NmMTQzZmY4MmFiZWQ5NjM0MWVhYmRj">“Good, now go, the both of you.”</p>
<p class="cnNlODQwMWMxMTM4YTQ4ZDRhOTQ1YzgwMDgzNTE4ZWJl">After a pair of slightly-improved salutes, the two workers exited the shop and vanished from sight. Serena turned and inspected the room behind the work area. It was a storeroom filled with bags of beans and leaves. Satisfied they were alone in the building, she returned to the table and positioned herself so she could face the doorway.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDgxMGZiZDBhNTQ2NjE5Y2ZmY2Q1MTg0NWRkZTA4">“What’s the Ichtaca thing about?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzNmYjk3Zjg0NDQxNjdiZjNlMjM1ZDNhMTg0MzAy">“An old intelligence trick for two agents to identify if they’re both part of Centralis Intelligence,” Serena explained, “It’s not really used anymore as the war has forced intelligence techniques to become more sophisticated. However, I know there’s an intelligence group monitoring us, and they know I know, it should be good enough.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTVlZDMyNmNlMjQyMGU4OWYxYjZhNTcxN2M3MzE3">She was overdue for a refresher course. New cryptographic methods had been invented, and some ships now had dedicated cryptographers to work alongside the sensors and communications officer. The only reason the <em>Vengeance</em> hadn’t had its protocols modernised already was because it filled a unique role in the navy and did not participate in normal fleet operations.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDdmNjkxMGFjNzQwMDFhNjZhMGY1N2Y2Y2MwZGQ1">“Why would Centralis be monitoring you?” Lord Yulan asked, “Because of the ship?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZjZkNmUyNjI4ODRiY2E4MzA0MGI5MmEzNTUzMGY5">“Because of this one,” she gestured to Amelia who gave a small shrug. “Our meeting was unexpected and she entered a contract with me before I could run things through the house proper. You can imagine why a human Speaker that specialises in healing is going to cause a few waves.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYjc1NTVmMWIwODQxNGI5MWJhYTAyNjMwZDMzNzg4">“That is most unusual. I thought Cascadia had banned humans from the military. Even before I was bedridden they were blaring warnings throughout the city to be aware of human spies in the demon districts.” Lord Yulan turned towards Amelia, “Where do you hail from?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNDUzNjFhOWIyMzQ2Yzg5MjBkMTQ2MmQ5ODZhMWY4">“Karligard.” Serena answered before Amelia could say anything. “She’s a talented healer and has spent most of her time travelling, not wanting to be sucked into the church's grip. She was looking to settle down and I made an offer. I’m sure you can understand why.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NmQ5ZWFiMmUwNDQ5YmQ5OTQzZmRlNDFmZjBiYjJk">Lord Yulan nodded, seemingly satisfied with the explanation. Serena didn’t like lying to the old man but it was too dangerous to share the truth of the situation.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWM2ZmFlYmNjYTQwM2M4YjNjZDUzZWFjNDEzNDhh">“Also, she’s not part of the military. Remember, she’s part of my personal retinue. She’s not in the chain of command,” Serena explained, making sure to drive the point home. As important as it was for Amelia to understand her place in the world it was equally important for everyone else to understand where she stood.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDRlNjdlMjI4MDQzOGFhNGU5N2RhNmEyNjlkN2M4">“I see,” Lord Yulan rubbed his chin thoughtfully before placing his hands on the table and standing up. “Would anybody like some coffee? Looks like this place has quite the collection.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOWViZjg5YjgyMDRhMzRiYmMxYThmOWQ4MzQwNDdm">“You seem awfully relaxed,” she said, “Considering everything that just happened.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YjI3MmNjMjc3NjQ1ZWZiZTNmNTU5MjFmYjI0ZDQ2">“Oh, I’m thoroughly <em>furious,</em> but if it’s true that I’ve been bedridden for a year, then that means I’ve gone an entire year without coffee! This is a problem that I endeavour to fix immediately!” Lord Yulan began opening some cans and sniffing their contents. “Some good variety here! We have some Yameni beans and even some from Shiloh! If a little cafe like this has Shiloh beans then they must have fixed the processing issues they were having.”</p><span class="cjI4NDA0Zjc3ODMyYzRhNjM5NmNhOWE5ZTI4NmZjZGI3"><br/>This book is hosted on another platform.

<p class="cnNhNjY1NTliZmYxZjRmYjQ5OTEyMzRiMDE3ZTNiN2Ex">“Do they have anything from Jimar?” Serena asked. A cup of coffee did seem appropriate, and it had been a while since she had tasted anything other than military-rationed coffee onboard the ship. Serena generally consumed the same things as the rest of the crew, with the only exception being an extra portion of sardis here and there.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzhmZTM2YWY2MDQ2Y2FiNThlYTc0M2IyMmIyZjA1">“Let’s see…” Lord Yulan mumbled as he investigated further, “Ah! Here we go! What brand is this… Jimar Gold? Sounds familiar…”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmZiNWNhNzhhNjRkMmI5ZjhjMGNhMDRkZjUwMmNh">“That’s a good one,” she said, perking up. “That’s what we used to serve you when you visited us at home.” She started to get up but stopped herself. It was better she kept an eye on the front of the shop. “Amelia, would you mind helping Lord Yulan grind some beans?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNDI4NjNlMTJkZjRmOTg4OWZkZTY2NDI1N2QyMzc2">“Okay! But I want a cup too!” Amelia bounced up and began helping Lord Yulan prepare three cups of coffee.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTZlYTE5MjQxYjRmODJhNmMyYWFlZTE4M2VjZjlk">“So…” Serena said, “Why did you never share anything about this nephew?”</p>
<p class="cnNkMzgxOGNhMjYyMjRkMmNiMDFhOTVlYTY5YmY5ODU1">“Well, he <em>was</em> estranged,” Lord Yulan grumbled as he poured beans into a hand grinder, “He always had a selfish personality but I was always amenable to the idea of him working in the hotel. I figured a career servicing others would help sort him out. It seemed to be working too. Speaker Thornheart, my dear, would you put that kettle on?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjdmMGQwNzA0NDQ3ZDQ4ZDQ2MTZjMzU0MmRlZTY2">“Sure! You can just call me Amelia if you want!” Amelia said with a grin. “Uh, how do I turn this on?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMjdiZWE1OWQ0NjRlYmE4ZjJlYjJkMThhMjkyY2Iz">“It’s a gas stove, turn that knob, yes, that one. Turn that and use one of those matches to light it,” instructed Lord Yulan before turning back to the topic at hand. “So the job seemed to be helping him, but then we had a tremendous… <em>snake </em>of a woman stay in the hotel. Some trumped up daughter of a Fengra Highlord. Well… the boy fell head over heels for her.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YzE5ODQyYjhhYzRlMGI4OTc3NmQ5NDI3ZTViNGU2">“What was her name?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTQ1ODc0NDNiNDRlMjRiZjllYzljYTQ3MjIwMzc4">“Haneul was her name. Haneul San. Her father was Manwese, and her mother was Ainese, hence her surname. She was ambitious and manipulative. I could see it from the start. She was using him to get to the hotel. I tried to get the man to see reason, but he always had a stubborn pair of horns.” Lord Yulan put the ground coffee in a coffee press and added hot water. A pleasant mouthwatering aroma filled the room.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTRlYmI5ODk3NjRjZmZiOWZjNGRhODM4YzUyMDgz">“That smells <em>amazing</em>! Mmm!” said Amelia, “I’ve never had coffee like this before!”</p>
<p class="cnMwMDYwZDZiZWVlMDRlMDk5ZWI1YmM1NTAyNTM1OTg5">“See if they have any snacks around there, dear Amelia?” Lord Yulan gestured to the other end of the work area. “Any biscuits or small cakes will be fine! Anyway,” he turned back towards Serena, “Eventually, the arguments got so bad I estranged the lad. He ran off to Fengra with his bride-to-be. I didn’t hear from him for the next fifteen years until he reappeared.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzMwNDIyMDViZjRlNmJiZmQzY2Q1MDgxMmYzMjA4">“He seemed to have turned a new leaf. Haneul had died, and his Ainese family didn’t want much to do with him. I took it at face value, but now I wonder if that was all a lie…” Lord Yulan shrugged and began pouring out three cups of coffee. “I became weaker and weaker as the weeks went on. He helped get me treatment and while each vial of medicine seemed to help at first, I would become even worse afterwards. Now I realise he was just feeding me more Dust.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODFhN2QzNjM2MTQ2ZTI5NjU2NzRkNjkwNzZlODQw">“Dust and some kind of poison to wear away at your constitution,” Serena pointed out.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTkyNmYyODg1NjQxODRiYjRlMTZiOTIyM2EyYzY5">“I suppose so. Ah, excellent work, Amelia.” The blonde-haired girl reappeared with a bundle of wrapped biscuits and cakes. “On the table, if you could.” Amelia dumped everything onto the table. A dozen and a half packets of paper-wrapped biscuits and cakes formed a tempting pile.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTBiNjI4MDEzNjQ0ZDJiODQ4YWNiZDVjNmMxM2Qy">“Ooh,” Amelia said, examining one of the biscuits. “Shortbread!”</p>
<p class="cnMxYzI4MjM0NzhkOTQ4ODJhYzNjMWIxZDMxODQ4ZGQz">Lord Yulan brought three cups to their table, gently placing them down. The steamy aroma made the atmosphere rather pleasant, and for a moment Serena took the time to relax and think of simpler times.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzM0ZDM5YWMzZTRmYmI4MjQ5Yzk4YWY2ZmFmNjM5">“Feels like we’re at House Halen, doesn’t it?” Lord Yulan asked, sipping from his cup. “Oh, how I’ve missed that taste.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OGQ4ZmY3YzlhNzQzMmRiMzFkYjlkYzc4MjUxNTE0">“Wow, it’s… so bitter!” Amelia exclaimed, scrunching up her nose.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDEyNTEyNjBhZTQ1N2ZhYTM1MjA1YjNjMDYyNDY3">“You get used to it,” Serena said with a smile. Everyone thought Jimari coffee was too bitter at first, and then they ask for another one and then another and soon it becomes their standard to measure all other coffees from. “Centralis cut coffee exports to the Federation and their allies, sanctions for the human support to the Republic,” she said to Lord Yulan, “So coffee has become cheaper within the Empire.”</p>
<p class="cnMyZmI2NzAxOTdhYzQ1NjVhZTFhNzhlMDM0ZmYwYzJh">“I bet they didn’t like that…” Lord Yulan grumbled, sipping his coffee. The trio of them sat in silence drinking their coffee. After a minute Amelia piped up.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTFkYTkwOGY4ZjRhNTg4OTI3NWMyZDMyZTdhOGI3">“So… what’s this darkblade thing everyone keeps thinking I am?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MTJjNjQwODU2NjRlM2Q4OWVkYzE5N2I3MWY3MWVk">“Ack!” Lord Yulan spluttered his coffee. “Ahem,” he said, using a napkin to clean himself. “You don’t know? Surely even in Karligrad those heretics have their grubby little fingers poking and prodding?” Amelia looked at Lord Yulan, and then at Serena with eyes that said <em>help me</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2U1NzIwYTc1ODQ1NDU4MGYwZDllNDMwNTc0MWJh">“Darkblades are followers of <em>Anathema,</em> the chaos god whose armies were defeated by the Empress so long ago,” Serena said, coming to Amelia’s aid. “They are also called <em>lifecheaters</em> as they use heretical magic to unnaturally extend their lives. The upper echelons of their group have a way of transferring their souls into another body, which makes them hard to track and kill.”</p>
<p class="cnM3Nzg2NzI2YTYyZTQxOThiYTQ1ZmU2MmYzMDBmODU2">Serena had originally thought Amelia was a darkblade, after she had so candidly admitted to being transported into a different body. Thankfully the truth-teller had helped calm things down, although she had panicked and almost Spoken on the ship. Of course, now she knew Amelia better, she was certain that no one this idiotic could be a part of that organization.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjYzODUwOWIzMjQ3OTI5MjRmYTE5OTEwNTE5YTUy">“I see…” Amelia said, looking thoughtful. “What’s their objective?”</p>
<p class="cnNhOTUzZDI1NGMwYTQxOTJiOTEzNjFlMWE5ODMxZDYy">“To win the war that they lost so long ago,” Serena said, shrugging. “To try and replicate the powers of Empress Elana.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYTdkMjExNDU3YjQzOTBhOGE3ZmFmZjM5YWIxYWNm">“Powers?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMzgwOGY4ZmFmNzRhYjdhNTYyODNiNzgwN2I4ODg5">“The Empress is immortal, forever young. She is powerful enough to ascend into the realm of godhood if she wants to. However, she stays here, guiding demonkind and Cascadia to prosperity.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNzdjOTg3YTkxYjRhNjdiNGFjMzYyNDU4YjRmYTZi">“Wow! I bet she’s really pretty! I can imagine her now…”</p>
<p class="cnM0MWE1MDRkNTAxZDRmY2E5MGVjN2NjYWY4Yzg2YWRi">“Oh?” Serena said with a smile, “And what do you imagine Empress Elana, a shard of infinity, to look like?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNzdkNGQ2ZDU0YjQ5YjE4MTIzMDYyN2U5NWFmNTMz">“You know… tall, with excellent posture. Horns like this,” Amelia motioned a familiar shape of horns on her head, “Black hair like this,” Amelia placed her hand palm down at a familiar level of hair. “Pretty crimson eyes that you could get lost in. Bet she struts about giving orders all the time as well.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NjdkYTE5NzYwYjRlZDFiMzhmNTE2YWU1ODcxMjUx">Serena felt herself grow hot. This damn idiot was really pushing her luck. She would definitely find a way to punish this kind of behaviour. After all, Amelia wasn’t subtle, and Serena was finding it harder and harder too…</p>
<p class="cnNiOTY3NzVmZWExNDQ1MmRiZGEyYzA1NjRiY2YwNDM3">Resist.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWRkMTg4ODljMzRjYTU4NzhhNzhiMGVhYWIyNTFi">She sighed. “Well, look over there; that’s a painting of her.” She gestured to the wall where a depiction of the Empress stood, leaning over a table with several other subordinates looking at a map of the Eastern Terra Firma.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzg0M2IzYmMxYzQzM2VhM2ZiZWRmOGM4ZTJmMzJi">“That’s her!?” Amelia jumped up to examine the painting. “She looks… so normal! I thought her horns would be huge! I was right about the black hair, though!”</p>
<p class="cnM1OWZhOGJhOTI5ZTRkOTZiY2FjZTJmMDhjYjMxM2Q2">“Hmm…” Lord Yulan leaned in, reading the Imperial tag on the painting. “Looks like this was three hundred years ago, when she came here to contain the monster waves after the Samino civil war. She takes a different form now.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTZiNDAwNDdmOTQ5ZmI4ZmQ3NGRhZTlmNTc3NjZj">“She takes a different form?” Amelia turned, eyeing Lord Yulan in confusion. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMjk4ZGFiMjRhYTQxMjNiODI0ZDA5YzY5MGQ3YzAx">“Not only is she immortal, but our Divine Empress can change her appearance at will. She does so often, matching her figure to the people of the lands she visits. It is a generous and tactful reminder that our Elana embodies all of demonkind.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjM0NzM3Njg4MTQ2YmM5OTYxMTVjMjYyZDc2M2U3">“That… that…” Amelia waved her arm about… “That’s crazy! Does she actually change form? It’s not illusion magic?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MGE4NWUxMTkyNDQwMjFhNmY4YzlkYzljYzQwMDkz">“Not illusion magic, my dear,” Lord Yulan said, shaking his head, “After she communed the Third Word, over the next few centuries, she communed even greater powers. It would be strange if she <em>couldn’t</em> change her form.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMDhhNzQ4YTg4NTRlMmJhNzNjM2RkMjNjNjY5N2Ux">“There’s also a rumour,” Serena said, jumping in, “That she semi-often visits random parts of the Empire—a pub here, an inn there—in full disguise that no one can see through or detect.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzk1YjQ1NzY4OTQ0NGZhODdkNjI1YzA1YWJhZDM1">“It’s not just a rumour,” Lord Yulan said, “Cascadian officials have made enough comments about those activities that it’s more considered an <em>open secret</em> than a rumour.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMjYzMGFiYzY0MzRjZGZiZjQ4NGY1YTY5OWYwNzA1">“So she could be anyone!? At any time?” Amelia asked, eyes open in surprise.</p>
<p class="cnNjODU2MzU1MTczZDQzM2FiOWI3OTRhMmQ1YzQ5MzE4">“That’s right,” Serena said, “This is why you need proper etiquette lessons. I don’t want you to be impolite to that bartender who is actually our divine deity on her night out! Ha!”</p>
<p class="cnNhZDk2ZTI2ZmU0OTRlNmJhODFkNmQ0YWUwMjIwMGZi">“Fine! I’ll take them seriously!” Amelia protested. “So what does she actually look like? Her original form?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNGE4NTg4ZTNjOTRkNjViZmJiMDI2MTA5NmZkZDEx">“Hmm…” Lord Yulan said, “She was originally born in Celle, and like all people of Cerulean heritage she would have…” His eyes suddenly narrowed as he looked at Amelia, “Golden hair and blue eyes. Just like you…”</p>
<p class="cnNiYzU1MjIyNmI3ZDQ1MTdiNGIwNzg1MTA0MTQ3MTc2">A moment of silence enveloped the trio as Amelia looked more and more awkward.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGE3Nzk1M2Q1MTRmMTU4OTU1OWFlOWI5MmU0MDgz">“Don’t worry,” Serena said, “I’ve long since decided that if this idiot is the Empress in disguise then all hope is lost and we should surrender now.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZTc5YTllMjFkYjQ3MTNhYmJjZTFhODY3N2NjZWQw">“Hey!” Amelia protested, “I’m very capable when I need to be!” Her cheeks were puffed out in that way that Serena had come to find very cute. Suddenly she wanted to ruffle that silky blonde hair. Messing Amelia’s hair up so it took on the appearance of bed hair did… strange things to Serena’s mind.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjlmNjgwN2I5MzQ5YTZiZDEyOWFhYmU2ZTJjZDVl">“The problem here is when you’re not capable, you’re a walking disaster!” she exclaimed, enjoying pushing the smug human’s buttons a little more.</p>
<p class="cnNkMWNhZTU1MGEzMzRhODI4ODY0MjlmYzE1ZGFjNDY2">“Well then!” Amelia huffed, hands on hips, “I <em>cannot</em> wait for our next martial arts lesson. I think it’s time I started to get serious! Hmm!? How about I tie you up like a knot and leave you hanging from the mast! Bet I can do it!”</p>
<p class="cnMyYmQ0OTc0MTRiNDQ5YmU4NDE5MDE5MDVlYzAzYzE4">“Idiot. If anyone’s tying anyone up, it’s me!” Serena glared at Amelia who for some reason gave a strange giggle and started to blush.</p>
<p class="cnNkY2NlZmQ1Y2Y5MzRjZmZiY2E0YTIzODdlYzMzOWEw">“Well, if you say so…” Amelia said quietly.</p>
<p class="cnM3NzQ5YWRlZGE3MjRhYzBhOWJiMDgyNjkyMzgzMzZm">“You…” Serena trailed off, the blushing human suddenly made her feel like blushing. Damn it!</p>
<p class="cnMzMmYyMzUxYzUzYzQ4NmU4MDNiZGJlNDliNjBmMDhl">“Well I must say Serena,” Lord Yulan intoned smoothly, “I am thoroughly delighted to see you’ve made a friend you can be comfortable with. You used to be so cold and now your heart's warmed up, hasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="cnNjZjIzMzJiYWRhNDRiMGM5YTgzODliOTFlNDUwNjEz">“Tsk! Stop speaking nonsense old man,” Serena mumbled, looking to the side. After a moment, she looked back to see Amelia grinning smugly at her and so she was forced to look away again! Damn it, now she looked like a nervous idiot!</p>
<p class="cnNlY2M5ZjBkZDY4NDRkZWI5ZWEzOGU4YzgzMWU5Zjdk">“You two lock horns like an old married couple. How envious I am of your youthful energy!” Lord Yulan cried out in an exaggerated manner. “Alas! What can an old set of bones like me do but guide the younger generations into happiness?”</p>
<p class="cnNmODZkNDVlMDc1NDQ0MTE5Njk0ZWY4NTM3ZWM5MDkw">“I think we get on great!” Amelia mused, “Serena pretends to be this serious, scary captain, but she actually has a big soft side! That’s my favourite part!”</p>
<p class="cnMwN2ViYmY4MjI2OTRlZTg4OTc5NGVkZmIyZTAyYzQw">“Stop saying unnecessary things… the both of you,” Serena muttered, feeling herself blushing even more. How was she supposed to deal with this two-sided attack!</p>
<p class="cnNhYjdkZDVhMDE0NDQyYmE5Yjc3Y2Y2YjViODE0NmE0">Luckily, she was saved by a pair of figures entering the doorway. A pair of demons with their faces shrouded in masks stepped through. As the door swung open, one of them raised the insignia she had given the employee. “Is this yours?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMzE3YTEwNDE5YjQ2ODViODIyYjNjNDJlMTFjOGM0">Serena stood up, gripping her marble sword. She stood in between the two groups. The demon that spoke carried a long-hafted mace in his other hand, while his partner - who had a womanly figure - carried a short sword and shield. She could sense their aether frothing inside them and reflexively spooled up her own.</p>
<p class="cnNjMjE1NGQ1YmViNjQ3ZWQ4NmQ0YzI1ZWQ4MzYxNzAx">“Who are you?” She asked, already suspecting the answer. With her free hand she gestured behind her the military hand signals. <em>Prepare. Fight</em>. She didn’t know if either of them would understand. Another thing to teach Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTBiYThkMmEzYjQ1NDE4NWVhMzZmYThkNTg5MDA0">“We found this hidden in the sock of a whimpering little rat,” the man said, dropping the insignia on the floor. “It was a nice plan you made, Captain Halen. Don’t worry; we’ve dealt with those interfering agents hovering about. Also,” the man removed his mask, revealing a thin mouth with scars running up both cheeks, forming a morbid smile. “We found a pair of teenagers at the end of this alley. They were so <em>eager</em> to help.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZTU2ZTJjMDFlNDQ3YjI4NTdkOTIzMDAzZGVjYzNh">Serena blinked, trying to stay calm. “Who are you?” She asked again.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzI2ZjNlZWRiNDQ2ODc4YjE2MDBmZWNmMzVjYTE1">“Does it matter? Can we just get started?” Said the female demon in annoyance, gripping her short sword tighter. Yellow aura spread across her body and her weapons. The male demon did the same, his long mace glowing yellow.</p>
<p class="cnM5MWQxNDU2ZTUyZDQ2MjlhNTlkN2JjOWQ0NjE1YTlh">It was third-level aura, and skillfully done too.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODZjNWMwMDk2ZTRjMzE4YWUxN2QyYTQ5Yjk2N2Q3">Which meant…</p>
<p class="cnNhNDE0ZTVhMzQ5MDRmODY4NDQwMTNkYjQzMzU2Y2U1">“Amelia!” She yelled, not taking her eyes off the pair in front. “Ward Yulan! Now!” Serena forced her aura to match, glowing yellow.</p>
<p class="cnMwOWQwMTgyZDc0ODRkN2JiNmNhMWNmODc0MzVlM2Nm">“<strong>Salinas,</strong>” Spoke the man.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTZlNzc3ZjA3NjRjY2NhOTdiMThjYzcxOTAzNGZj">“<strong>Taruna,</strong>” Spoke the woman.</p>
<p class="cnM0Nzk5MDcyN2Q0NDQ5NmY4ODU5M2ViNDRmYjgxNDFh">And everything exploded.</p>

      <description>Chapter Eighteen: Mutual Confession</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNhZjg4ODVkOWI4ZDQ4YTlhNmMxZTJmYmFiYWQ4YzNm"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMxZGJmZTZhYjExMjRkZmI5MzIyYzc1ZWFlZDZkYmMx">Serena was thrown back, smashing through the wall into the building beyond. Despite being wrapped in yellow-aura the shock caused her to bite through her tongue. She spat blood, raising an arm to protect herself as the ceiling collapsed on her. She hurried the Word to form, layering the aether upon itself, folding it into the required structure for communion with <em>Narean</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2ZiOTg1OGM0OTQ3ZWY4NzJjY2YyMmVmNmQwY2Nk">Surprisingly, she found it formed with surprising <em>obedience</em>. Speaking <em>Narean </em>always included a brief battle of will, a demonstration that the Speaker still possessed the power and determination to demand the abilities of the demonic sword god. This time, <em>Narean</em> seemed almost <em>eager</em> to assist. Was this because she was so much stronger after crossing the boundary into blue-aura? Or did Amelia’s ward help in some way?</p>
<p class="cnMyMWZkMGU3NmNkYTQ1YTdiMGE2Mjc0MzJmYTJlYTEz">Despite the aether going wild outside, and the wood and stone forming into sharp points that tried to piece her through, Serena was resolute. She wouldn’t allow the skills of <em>Salinas,</em> the Earthlord, to cut her so easily.</p>
<p class="cnM1YWU4MmI3YTNjMDRlYzZiMjRlZWRkNjcyNjg1ODUz">“<strong>Narean.</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnM0Njc2MjljZTk3OTQ2YjFiZDgxNzg0MmUwZmE5MWMz">Her vision darkened for a moment and she felt like she had just been turned upside down as the power of the sword god flowed into her. Her stored aether was expelled forcefully - blowing away the rubble and the incoming attacks - and was replaced by the clean and pure aether from the divine realm. She slipped easily - almost too easily - into the fourth-level, her body glowing softly with green light. Hellfire ignited on her horns and the familiar tail formed from the base of her spine, a fifth limb she would make full use of.</p>
<p class="cnMxZTYwMjg1ODAzMDQzODhiNDJjYjFlYzI1ZTRmN2M5">She leapt back into the ruined cafe, swinging the marbled sword that she had never let go of. A testament to her training and instincts. The man with the scarred face formed shells of stone and earth that he flung at her at speeds that would blow apart any lesser warrior. She cut through one, two then deflected another before being intercepted by the female demon who swung her shield, throwing Serena towards the wall.</p>
<p class="cnNkODRmNGUwMDFmYTRmMmFhZWNhZjYwNzg3MzMyZGFl">Serena didn’t smash through, pulsing the aether strongly enough to produce enough of an anti-gravity effect to slow down. She cast a wary eye at the environment, taking in as much information as her accelerated mind could. The man stayed at the back, using his long-hafted mace as a staff, forming earth attacks that floated in a semi-circle above his head. The masked woman stood between them, her shield and short sword glowing green.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzY1NTRlZDI4MzQ1YzFhZTllYTk1YzRhYWNlZmM2">“An earthlord and a paladin,” she said, maintaining awareness of her surroundings. Where was Amelia? Lord Yulan? “What secret lies in Highguard that you’ll Speak to protect?”</p>
<p class="cnM1OWJmNTMxYWFlOTRkOWE5ZGY0NDMwOTZiMTU2N2Ji">They didn’t respond and the man mumbled something under his breath. The wind picked up and a sandstorm engulfed the cafe, blinding her vision. No matter, Serena didn’t need vision to fight. She closed her eyes and relied on her aether senses to identify attacks.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTYyZmU3OWIwZDQ2YWFhNjhkMzgzYzNlODU5ZWNh">The woman unleashed a flurry of attacks on her, forcing Serena to adjust her stance to avoid being pushed back. She swung her katana in response, parrying and striking where she could. She couldn’t afford to allow the paladin to get inside her range, for they were experts in close-quarter combat.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGY2YzY5MTc2OTRhMTY5MzZjYzkwN2FhOTE5NDc4">Her senses detected the movement of aether in the rubble near her, and blades of stone and wood struck out, seeking to strike through her blind spots. Serena deflected or dodged these attacks, her senses giving her just enough warning. She put her tail of hellfire to work, striking out in opportune moments or defending against an attack that slipped through her defence.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTI0YzJiY2JiNDQyMWNiZWVhMGNmZTA2YTJlY2Iw">“Stubborn,” the woman said through gritted teeth. The paladin jumped back and raised her sword. “<em>Turana’s Zeal</em>!” she yelled, and the rest of the building's upper floors were blasted away as a bolt of red lightning struck the shortsword, wrapping it in crackling energy. Even though her eyes were closed, the lightning could be seen through her eyelids. In her senses, the aether was flowing around the sword like a storm.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTIzNDIyNzIyODQyZTQ5MThmNmMyZmE0ZGQ3NzZk">Her instincts warned her of the new danger and she pushed her aether further, trying to breach the boundary into the next level. It wasn’t easy, and the insurmountable wall that she had crossed only once before held firm. Undeterred, she threw her aether against it, chipping away at the metaphysical boundary as she sought new power. Surprisingly, <em>Narean</em> didn’t appear to add any resistance like he usually would.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjFiNzhlZDIyOTQ4ZmNiZDM1MWYwMjM3NzBjMmRj">The pair attacked again. The man had changed tactics and instead of large shells of earth was favouring dozens upon dozens of smaller bullets. Too many for her to dodge. Each one could maim or kill a first-level warrior but as a hint of blue appeared within Serena’s aura they only bruised her.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDQ5OTc1ODEzNTQxMjM4MDExMGIyZWRjYWJlN2Zl">The woman’s empowered short sword was the real problem, and it chipped Serena’s marbled katana with every swing. Thankfully the speed hadn’t increased, only the power. With each collision, lightning struck out from the point of impact, hitting the surroundings randomly.</p>
<p class="cnM1YmNhMjQxOWQ4ZDRiN2I4ZDA5OWE0MGQ3YjE4OWI1">“Hurry up,” growled the man. “He’ll arrive soon. Kill her!”</p>
<p class="cnNiNjk4NzRmZDVjMTRlMjZiMTRkOGU0ZTA4NDlmODJm">“Fucking trying,” the woman spat between strikes. “Bitch’s aura is tough.” The woman tried to bash Serena again, but just as her foot stepped forward to shift the weight into the attack, Serena struck out with her hellfire tail knocking the woman momentarily off balance.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmNkOGFlMzE1ZTQ4YzQ4ODY2ZDY3NTllYzYxNDQ3">She swung as hard as she could, ignoring the flurry of bullets striking her. She missed the woman's neck but was able to cut through the skin of the shoulder, giving her a light wound. Damn paladins! This was the first time she’d fought one properly, and she found it true what she had been told; they could fight at a level above their aura. They were a tough nut to crack.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjI4YjQ5ZDA2MjRjNTdiZDEzNTVhODIyYWRkYjdk">“Ah!” The woman backed away, recovering her stance. “Stop fucking about with magic and get in here,” she commanded the man, who swore and with a spoken spell covered his body in earthen armour. Stone flowed up his long-hafted mace and formed menacing spikes at the end. He approached cautiously as Serena tightened her grip and planted her feet.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTNmYzU4YTFlMjQyMGM5ZjY4OThkMzNhOTU2NDI5">How many seconds had passed since she Spoke? The heightened senses meant time slowed down for Speakers. They could fight, speak and comprehend faster than normal. Ten seconds? A dozen?</p>
<p class="cnM0YzhkNDI4NzI1ODQ3MjY4Nzk3YjBhNGI1Y2I2YWQz">Something was coming, pushing its way through the rubble. A familiar aether signature.</p>
<p class="cnNlMzM3NzVkMjkyNjQzNGM5MGZjZDgxOTQ3MGY1ZWRi">Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM5NTQ4MzJmMTY3NjQ1NGU4ZDQ4ZDk1M2U2ZmNkMDY4">Serena deflected a swung mace aiming to take her head off, while the woman’s short sword cut her side. Serena kicked out, striking with her tail and twisting her katana to cut the man’s armour. The frantic assault was beyond her current capabilities but as the wounds built up she felt that internal wall break down and her aura took on more and more blue.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTllODcyODc0MzQ3YTlhMWQ2MzMxMGMwYWNkODUx">“Bitch going blue,” grumbled the woman as the paladin’s aether flared and she unleashed a series of strikes that Serena couldn’t fully defend against. The sword cut her and the woman flared her aether again and a bolt of lightning caused Serena’s body to tense momentarily. Before she could recover, the mace slammed into her side, throwing her across the room.</p>
<p class="cnM1OTk0Y2VkZDhmMDRjODZhMWUyYmMzMjlkNTUyODQ1">She spat blood as she sensed a familiar aether signature standing over her.</p>
<p class="cnM3M2QxMGFlMTVlNjQ1YTY4ZDZmZWM0YWM1ZWY4MTUy">“Is <em>Narean</em> behaving?” Amelia asked, head tilted. Warmth erupted throughout her body as Amelia healed her. Then her body glowed in hues of silver and gold as some kind of ward wrapped itself around her. Serena opened her eyes to find the sandstorm had died down. The cafe looked like a desert, and Amelia was looking at her with a concerned expression. The human looked no different than a minute ago.</p>
<p class="cnM4NDYyMGU0ZjNlNDRhYzVhM2ZmMWQ5NTgyZGQwNWJj">“Amelia! Speak! They’re a paladin and an earthlord! Get-” The earthlord appeared behind Amelia, swinging his massive mace with two hands against her head. The woman struck at Amelia’s neck, the red lightning crackling with power. Serena leapt up, feeling her aether blast through the barrier as she stepped into the world of blue. She swung towards the woman in desperation, but the huge mace slammed into Amelia’s head and at the same time the woman's shortsword reached the delicate neck and-</p>
<p class="cnNhYmQ5Yjg1NDE2MjQ2NGRhMzJiOTZmYmJhNWY2MGFi">Nothing.</p>
<p class="cnMwZGRkZGU4YmJkZjQyNDg5NGRiZmEwOGMzMjQwMDgy">“Oh?” Amelia said softly as the heavy weapon shattered against her head, ruffling her golden hair. “What’s this?” She mumbled, the shortsword was held in her grip, its red lightning cracking uselessly. “<em>Turana’s Zeal</em>, is it? How nostalgic…” The woman tried to pull the sword free but Amelia’s hand didn’t budge an inch. Then - almost too fast for Serena to see - the human grabbed the wrists of both of the enemies.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDZjMGNjOGIxYTQ4MTNhYzZhZTk3OTdjYzU5YzI2">“Amelia!” Serena exclaimed, “How…?”</p>
<p class="cnM3OWMyYjVkYjA2OTQ4ZmVhZjg0YmE1NDhkM2ViMWE3">“I’ve already Spoken,” she said plainly. “Took a few seconds as I wanted to do it quietly. No point blasting away half the street.” She turned a head towards Serena, ignoring the armoured fist slamming into her head again and again. “Lord Yulan’s fine, by the way. Made sure to get him safe. As for these two…” Amelia's eyes darkened, and Serena saw behind those eyes that glowed golden; there was a background of crimson.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTdiOTZiMDQwZTRmOTM5YmE3YmFiOTlmMzZkYzdl">It was terrifyingly beautiful.</p>
<p class="cnM0NjlkYWQyOWMzNTQ1ODFiMWE2ZTBiYThiYTY4NDg3">“It’s <em>Salinas</em> and <em>Turana,</em> then?” Amelia asked, her voice lacking its usual clumsy cheerfulness. The two demons cried out in pain as an audible snap came from their wrists. Amelia had broken them. “Did you fools not hear my warning?”</p>
<p class="cnNlYmI4M2Y3MDdhZjQ3OTdhZjMyMzBmZDFlOGE1ZmJk">“Gah! Bitch! I don’t even know you!” gasped the woman, as she tried to free herself.</p>
<p class="cnM1Nzc4MGI0Y2Q0NzQ3MmFiMDNlMzc3NjBlNzllZjI5">“Not <em>you</em>,” snapped Amelia. “I’ll ask again… <em>did you not hear my warning?</em>” Serena involuntarily gulped. Amelia used some kind of spell when she asked that question. Something rippled in the aetherfield, and for the first time, she became aware of something else, another layer that formed underneath the aether. Whatever it was, it reacted strongly to Amelia’s words.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTI1MDU2MDk3MDQ3OTRiMzVlOWFkOWU3MzdmZDhm">The woman suddenly spewed blood from her mouth. She screamed in agony as her skin cracked and poured blood and aether. “<em>Turana</em>! Why!” she cried. The woman’s aura violently shifted from green to yellow, then it dimmed to orange and finally red before vanishing entirely. The woman was unconscious and entirely defenceless.</p>
<p class="cnNhZGYxZTc3YjkwNTQ5YmE5NGFmNTJkNzY2MzgzNDY4">What in the seven hells had just happened? Serena’s mind raced at the scene before her. Did Amelia just… expel a Word from someone? She swallowed nervously. Amelia had said she had Spoken, but to do this… had she Spoken only one word? Spoken only the First Word?</p>
<p class="cnMzZDJlMWQzM2NkYTQ3OGRhYjJjMDNmZmZkYzAyZDVh">“Amelia-” she began, interrupted by the sudden cry from the man.</p><span class="cjhkMGY2N2YxMzA0MjQ3YjFiNzQyNTYwNTc3M2ZiNTFh"><br/>This tale has been unlawfully obtained from Royal Road. If you discover it on Amazon, kindly report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMxYWYxZmFhYmU5NTRhNTliNGMwYjc1MTUzM2E4NWJj">“<em>Salinas</em>! I give you my soul! Bestow upon me the means to escape!” The scarred man roared.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWVjZmQyZDYyNDQyZmQ4YTBlMmZiZmRkNWQxNWE3">For a moment, nothing happened.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWI0MTdhYzEyNDQ5NmQ4NmVkMTVmODBiNzE1ODlh">“What an ambitious demon god you are…” Amelia mumbled as power and aether erupted from the man who ripped his arm away, leaving a bloodied hand behind.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGFjNTZkMjQ3NDRiYjFhNDM4NzhmM2RjYThmNjZk">The earth bent and buckled underneath their feet and then <em>opened</em>. The surrounding buildings above collapsed upon them, accelerated by some gravity spell. It slammed into the group, and they were flung down into the darkness. Serena spun this way and that before something reached out and pulled her close.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjJmZGZhY2EyMDRiMjY4ZGRjNDBlZGIyMDFhZWY3">“Hold on!” Amelia yelled, pulling her into an embrace. Aether flowed about them as some kind of defensive spell was cast, and they slammed into the ground. As the building fell upon them, her ears were bombarded with a violent array of noise and sound, but Amelia’s magic formed an invulnerable pocket.</p>
<p class="cnNlY2RiZGM0NTJkYjRiMDE4NDcyZTJlZDgwNDFiNWM3">And then, as quickly as it happened, it all stopped.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGUyY2VmMGYwYTQwZDQ4MTM2MWMxNTkzZmI1MTQ2">Silence.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzYzMmJiMjE5MjRmOWNiYWJhMmZmY2U1Y2M2Mzlj">Serena could hear her rapid heartbeat in her ears, she could hear her fast breath. Amelia lay in her embrace, her face nested in Serena's chest. Slow, delicate breaths came from the human. For a few moments, all Serena listened to were the sounds of their breathing. Slowly, the awkwardness of the situation grew on her as the continued intimacy threatened to make her blush.</p>
<p class="cnNiZDY1YzlmNjZkZTQyMDg4MDU0ZDcwNjA2ZDViYmY0">“G-get off me, idiot!”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWEzZmNhMDY5YTQ1YjE5ZmY4Njc3YTg3MTJkMTFj">“Mmm… so comfy,” Amelia mumbled, rubbing her head a bit, before thankfully pulling away with a familiar smug grin. “You alright?” she asked, as if nothing was out of the ordinary.</p>
<p class="cnNlNWVhZDc5YWViYjRiMDk4YjYwOTQxNTI0Mzk2NGM1">“I think so…” Serena looked at Amelia, who was sitting there looking nonchalant. The glow from her body gave her enough light to make out their cramped surroundings. “So… you can hide the aether release? I didn’t sense you Speaking.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDVkZTc4ODI5YjRhMWM4MjBiZDQ2MWI4ZWE1NGYx">“Well,” Amelia looked down at her thumbs, playing with them nervously. “I only recently remembered how to do it… it’s not that big of a deal, right?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YTBmMzY0NjlkMDQxZTg5Mzg4ZjczZWI2MmRmMTA3">“It’s rare, but not impossibly so,” Serena said. “The grandmaster at the academy I learned the sword could do it. I think some Highlords and most Greatlords can Speak silently.” She sat up and examined the human, noting the previously golden eyes with a hint of crimson had returned to their normal shining blue.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTBkZTA5NWM5ZTQzOGRhM2NmZTU3YjY2NGIzYjc1">That was interesting. All Speakers underwent some physical change when Speaking the First Word. Serena embraced hellfire when she Spoke <em>Narean</em> but she had known another Speaker who Spoke the same Word but would instead be covered with a chilling frost.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGI0MjBlOTJhNDRkNzRiMjczNzU4MmI1MWU0OGUw">As for Amelia, those golden crimson eyes had looked a little like demon eyes. It seemed the human's disposition towards demonkind had a knock-on effect on her appearance.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzMyOGJkZWY3OTRlOWY5N2Q1MDI0ZDZjMmIxNzk1">All the more reason to get her citizenship as soon as possible and protect her under Cascadia’s watch. If the human nations found out that the physical traits of demons had corrupted <em>Aseco’s</em> gold, armies would march and navies would sail.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzZkNWM4ZjY0YjRmMGY4ZWFiMDQ5ZmU0MGI3ZWQ4">“Can I ask you something else?” She asked Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWE0OGM5MjFmNDQxNjg4Njk3M2RlMjQ0NzE2YTYw">“I suppose so…” Amelia muttered, “... but I can’t promise I’ll answer.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZDhhZjcwNjE5MTQ2NzJiMjc3YjBkZjhhZTI3YTBi">“What did you do to that <em>Turana</em> Speaker?” She ran the scene in her mind again. It was something she had never seen before. It wasn’t something she could just let go either. Answers were needed.</p>
<p class="cnNmM2ZkZGM3NjkxNzRiNTdiMzg2ODJkZDc0MmI4MmZj">“I…” Amelia opened her mouth and then closed it. She tried again to no avail. A few seconds later and Serena could see her mouth start to quiver and then…</p>
<p class="cnNiMDEwMTJkMTI2MzQyYzBiNWM4Y2QyMjAwMzE5M2E0">“Are you… crying?” She asked, unsure of what to do.</p>
<p class="cnNhN2RhZGQ3NzA5NTQyNjA4YjNmYjQ4NGU4NzNkNDcy">“I can’t keep pretending! I never asked to be like this!” Amelia cried out, blubbering the words through a sudden torrent of tears. “I never asked to be Speaker! I didn’t-” Amelia sniffed and wiped her eyes as best she could. “I didn’t think it was <em>real</em>!” She sobbed into her hands.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjk2ZDYwZjFhNzQwMjI5ZWU2NGIxNzBiOGM3MzIz">Serena didn’t understand what Amelia was saying, but seeing her friend cry so intensely caused a pang of sympathy. She wasn’t sure exactly what was troubling Amelia, so she shuffled closer and put an arm around her. Amelia responded, tilting her body and head to rest against her chest as she cried.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTZlZjcyODM3NzQxMTg4NTM5YTZiNzRkODliOWQx">“What do you mean?” She asked, “What didn’t you think was real?”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTYxYTBmMDBiMzQ3NTdiMzM3ZWNjNGZmNDRiNDEz">Amelia was quiet before the answer came, almost whispered. “Speaking…”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTZkZWJkMTgyYzRhNjliMzk3MzI0YTUyNjc5MDI2">“Speaking?”</p>
<p class="cnM0NDA4OTBkZGM2MzQ4YzM4ODY5OTQyOTU4NDQ1ZDM3">“It was just a <em>game</em> where I came from! Magic wasn’t real! Aether wasn’t real! We… we…” Amelia’s hands gestured aimlessly, “We just <em>pretended</em>. For entertainment!”</p>
<p class="cnM4OWZlNmVmNWEzOTQzNDNhODlhZmE5ZGMyOTQyMjVj">Serena frowned at that. A game? Entertainment?</p>
<p class="cnMwMzEyMDU0OTc5YTQzZjViMWJmMWI0MzMzNWMwNmE1">“I don’t understand, how can you Speak without aether?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZDBjOTMzNTc2ZTQ2ZDc5NDlmNDY0YzhhNzE4YzE0">“We didn’t Speak! The idea of Speaking was just an abstract concept!” Amelia sniffed, calming down slightly. “Imagine… umm… are there any military games you teach the trainees to prepare them for… battle?”</p>
<p class="cnMxY2ZmZjkxOTcxOTRhYjNhMjFjYTBiN2NhZDI3YmM0">“There is… Captain’s Chess. It’s used to teach the basics of fleet command,” Serena said, thinking of the popular academy game. Variations of it were dominant in civilian life, and there were even grand competitions hosted every year.</p>
<p class="cnNmMmQ1YTE3NjA1ZTQ3MTJiYTQ2NWFiMTQxOWMxMjA2">“Right! I don’t know how it's played, but imagine each player picks a character that they have as their captain, right? Some would give bonuses to fleet movement, some would give more damage from shellfire?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YWY0ZGI5MDBjNTQzYmI5YjQzMjBmMGM0YTU2ZDI5">“I can imagine that…” Serena said. What Amelia had described wasn’t all that different from the real thing.</p>
<p class="cnNhOTRjZWRmZWJmMTQ2ZTE4YTUxYTNjNDI3OGQxNTFh">“Alright, so imagine as you win games, you win points that you can spend to upgrade your fleet and captain permanently, which would carry over into all the games you played?”</p>
<p class="cnM0NzFiN2UxODY2ZjRkNDk4MWQ1MzFmYmY1MWRmN2Zk">“That would be most unfair, it-”</p>
<p class="cnNkZDJiMTg4ODRjYTRiNDA5MDQyMDM1ZGRlYzcxZmQ2">“Just <em>imagine</em>!” Amelia exclaimed, lifting her head and looking at Serena with glistening blue eyes, dirt and tears covering her cheeks.</p>
<p class="cnNjODdhNDAwN2Q4NzRjYzA5OWVjY2MxZDNjYjY5ZTIz">“I… understand the concept.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDc5OGNiNDg5NjQ3ZWQ5ODRlMjY4MzdmMDZjMWZh">“Okay, so there’s this game, but you’re not actually a captain, and you don’t actually have a real fleet; the game and its rules just represent it, right?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YmFiZjFmYTg1MjRjNzNhNDExZjk1ODE5ZTJiNzE2">“Right.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNDc0YTc4ZmFmYTQwMWM5MDMwZjBiZmNlZjc0NTMz">“Now imagine the last thing you remember is you’re playing a game, with your fleet and captain that you’ve spent thousands of games spending points making really strong. Imagine you’re doing that, and the next thing you know, you’re somehow thrown into a different world, a different <em>realm</em> where suddenly you’ve become that captain, and you have all the abilities and strength of your captain character you upgraded!”</p>
<p class="cnMxYzEwZTA1YjAyMTQ0OTE5OTZmODZkNTRiNjk0ZGRl">Serena opened her mouth and then closed it. She looked at Amelia with a questioning gaze. “Is that… what happened to you?” She asked softly. Amelia nodded, the movement prompting another tear to roll down her cheek.</p>
<p class="cnMxMjgzZGI2NmNkNDRkODliZTAzYTZiYzQ3NGFiM2Y1">“Yes… only my game wasn’t about captains and ships. It was about Speaking! Spending points so that my character which I <em>designed</em>,” Amelia gestured to her body, “To look like this, to learn all kinds of Words. I don’t know how it happened but somehow I’m in the body of my character and I’m pretty sure I have all the abilities I gave her!” Amelia sniffed, “And I’m so scared! I have all this power and I’m afraid to use it! I could hurt so many people without meaning to!” Amelia started crying again, so Serena pulled her into a desperate hug.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjI4ZDU3YzE3YzQwYzM5YmUyNDlkNTYxYjYwOWJm">It didn’t make complete sense, but suddenly a significant part of the puzzle had fallen into place. An impossible human with impossible healing powers. It shouldn’t have been possible, but it was. A game that had trained her through <em>entertainment</em> rather than the years and decades of determination and suffering it took most others.</p>
<p class="cnMxNTVhM2U1Y2U3ZTQwZmZiOTBlZTdjN2FmN2MzNTcw">“This… isn’t a game,” Serena said softly, running a hand through Amelia’s golden hair. “I’m not a character you played with… right?”</p>
<p class="cnMyMGY5OTMxZGMxZDRjMTJiZGIxMTM2NWRmMWEyZjE2">“No,” Amelia awkwardly shook her head, which was pressed into her chest. “Only the Speaking thing and the names of the gods are familiar. Everything else... flying ships, the Empire, floating islands, and moon crystals are completely new…”</p>
<p class="cnM4NjEzNjY0OWIyZDQ1Zjk4Mzk5MTRjOWQ1Y2RhMGZi">“I see…” They sat in silence for a moment as Serena ran the conversation they just had through her head several times. She didn’t want to bombard Amelia with questions but…</p>
<p class="cnMyZWQ2MjEyMjI0NTQ3ZTQ5MmQ4ZjY4ZjAzYjQ3YTQ2">“How many Words did your character learn?” She asked quietly.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzdjM2ZjZDE5MjQzNzQ5ODJjNDFhZjJjNzNkOTNl">“I don't know… most of them, I suppose.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMWFhNTA4OTY4NjRmMDM5NTRjY2U0MWM1ZjMwNmM1">Most of them! Serena felt her eyes go wide and took a deep breath. “You know… most of the human Words?”</p>
<p class="cnNkM2Q4NmY0ZjliYTQyZmE5NzM1YTgwODQ3M2MzMmY5">“No…”</p>
<p class="cnM3Mjc4Y2ViM2RiOTQyMmNiNmYyYWI1YmIzNmU0YWE1">“No?”</p>
<p class="cnM5MWY1NzdmZDUyYTQ4NjBhNzY0NWY1YWZlNDZjM2Qw">“My character didn’t always look like this,” Amelia said, pulling away and holding out her blond hair. “Before I used to play with a character that was a demonic mage. In the years I spent in the hospital, I must have put in thousands upon thousands of hours training her up! She knew… basically all of the demon Words…” Amelia fiddled with her hair, “For a joke I made my character look like this, and then I became her but… I feel that I can still Speak all the demon words… if I wanted to.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NmNlNWZjOThhNzRlNmRhMjQ2MTYyNzNmNzcyMWFk">Serena quietly absorbed this information. She thought back to a conversation between her and Anathor. A blessing from the gods couldn't make someone a Speaker, but what if Amelia had received a blessing from an entity greater than the gods? There were myths, talked about only half-seriously, that spoke of <em>things</em> living in the mists, and other realms of unimaginable power.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDg3YzA2NmJlOTQ5OGI4YWRiMjVkNzI4YTY5MDZk">Amelia kept her eyes low, seemingly afraid to meet Serena’s. “You don’t… hate me, do you?” she whispered.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2FhNTJjZTJkNjQ1ZDI5ZjY3MjZjZmQ1OWVmYWE5">“Why would I hate you?”</p>
<p class="cnM5M2Q4ZDVlOWI5ZDQzOGE4Mzk5MWNlNzZkZTQ2ZWE5">“Because I kept this from you… kept it hidden. Speaking is such a big deal here and look at how everyone reacts when they find out I can speak just <em>one Word</em>. I’m sorry…” Amelia trailed, “I didn’t want to scare you off! I really like being around you, and I don’t want that to change…”</p>
<p class="cnMxMjkzYzQxYTI0MjRiZjZiODcyY2QxNDZlYTAzZmM2">Serena sighed, and pulled Amelia closer. “I don’t hate you, idiot.” Serena rested her head against the top of Amelia’s. “I’m glad we have somewhat of an explanation. It doesn’t answer everything, but I don’t think you’re lying. Besides, I like you being around as well…”</p>
<p class="cnMwOTRlNWIyYzY3MTRjYjI5ZjU0Mzg0MTVlMzU4M2Zl">“Really?” Came a small voice.</p>
<p class="cnNmMmUyZWVkYWUxZjQ0ZTNiNDc5YWU2ZDE3NWE4Nzlk">“You’re an annoying idiot, but you’re my annoying idiot,” Serena ruffled the golden hair. “I admit, I’m tired of playing the obedient daughter or the strict captain all the time. I can’t remember when I could last speak so comfortably to someone, but somehow I can do that with you.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMGZkYjA3NjE2ODQwYzc4ZjE2ZjRjM2JmNDQ3YTgw">“So, can I stay with you? Is the contract still valid?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YmFiN2Y2ZjM0NjRlMDhhZjdlMTdmOTVjN2VjODdj">“Of course, I swear on my horns.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNWI5MWU3NDM5MTQ3ZjM5ZGJhZWRkZjIwMzEyMzli">“Then… can I… get a raise?”</p>
<p class="cnMyMDNmNGJiMGNlYzQ5ZDI5MmJhY2U5NTJjOGVkMWE3">“Pfft!” They both laughed at that, a much-needed release. “Once we speak to my father, we can sort something out,” Serena explained. “So, would you be able to explain what you did to that <em>Turana</em> bitch? It felt like you used some power when you asked her a question, and then she lost all her abilities.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMTdkZTUwZTA2YzRjMmQ4NmRmYThhMzkxOTcxMThk">“I um… last time when you fought Korvus and <em>Narean</em> took control, I kinda threatened them all…”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDVhMTk0MjhmODQxMjI5ZjAxYzM2MjE5ZmU0MWQ5">“Threatened who?”</p>
<p class="cnMzY2VjMzZmY2JjYjQzNjdhNzJlODNjMDgyNTA2NWFm">“The demon gods… told them to behave themselves around you.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZjRlNmFlMWE3NTRiZjBhMmI2ODBiNDZiNDBkMWI1">“Please tell me you’re joking,” Serena said, “Because that’s insane.”</p>
<p class="cnNkM2E3MTNhOTZlYzRiZjU4ZjU0ZWJiMDE0NmU1MGVl">“Then I’m insane,” came the reply. “Although, I only yelled a bit at the lesser gods. They’re really not that tough, just arrogant children flailing about trying to get the higher gods' attention.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNGQ5NjY3MzQ4ZDRiYTViMTM1MjY4NjQ1NGU0ZTFh">A few seconds passed as Serena digested that information. “When you talked about the warning earlier, I felt something ripple, but it was weird. It was like there was something underpinning the aetherfield that reacted.”</p>
<p class="cnNjOWUzNmI2YzI1NTRlMWU5ZjllYWQ0NjZlOTA1MzQ1">“I think that’s the mistlands. I spoke to <em>Turana </em>directly, so I had to send my words through the mists to reach his realm. At least, that’s what I feel I did on an instinctive level. I don’t have that much comprehension of how it all works, you know? When a trainee moves their fleet to attack in a game of Captain’s Chess that wouldn’t give them much understanding of what it’s like to actually command a fleet, right?”</p>
<p class="cnM3OWM4NTFiNTZmZTQxY2E4NzNkNTJhMmUxZWJhZjQ5">“Right…” So what she had felt was the mists themselves. Was it because she had finally reached blue-level aura again? Serena realised she was idly stroking Amelia’s hair. So soft. “You really spoke to <em>Turana </em>directly? A god?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDE4ZmRjMTM3YjQ5ZDI5MDg5N2ExYTI3ODQxNDY5">“Yeah, and did you see how he ran away from his vessel with his tail tucked behind his legs?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNjc0MjJkYjQ3ZDQ3YThiZjNkNGRiNGZhMWE2ODkw">“I did… speaking of! Where are they?!” She had forgotten entirely about her adversaries!</p>
<p class="cnNmOWNjNTYwMzc1YzQ2YTQ4Y2NiNWQxOGNiZjhjZjE0">“They fled, I thought about stopping them but…” Amelia trailed off.</p>
<p class="cnM1OTAzNDEyYzA5NjRkNThhOGJjMmRhODZlMjQzZWQw">“But?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYzNmZjljY2RmMjQ2ZTdhYjE5Y2JjYmRjMDdmM2Mw">“But I was so comfortable… being held by you.”</p>
<p class="cnNhM2NlMGQyNTgzZjQxMTY4MzAwNzUxM2IzMmQ3NmY2">Serena felt heat rise in her cheeks. Well, if Amelia was spilling everything out it might as well be time to address the arcwhale in the room.</p>
<p class="cnM1Mjk4ZGVkODM1ZDQ0YjJiMDMxNDYxYzA5YTQ1NjEy">“Amelia… how do you feel… about me?” She asked cautiously, feeling her heartbeat speed up and Amelia reflexively tense. The human was quiet for a dozen seconds before she finally answered.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTM3ODMwZDIxMDQzMjI4Y2VjOTg5NWU1YmZmZjU1">“... Isn’t it obvious?” she whispered.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzc3ZDE4NTM2MTRkNGFhOTc1NDIwYjZmZjRhMGEw">“Amelia, I’m a demon. You’re a human… I think.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTQ1MzEzNjM2MTQyZmZiMzQ3ZjQxNjAxYmNhMDAy">“I told you when we first met, didn’t I? I like demons.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMTE2MTA0MzY1ZTQ1MTJhNjFlYjllNzYxYzNlY2Jh">So she had. Serena suddenly found herself smiling. Why was she suddenly so happy? Damn it, she knew why. She knew exactly why. She opened her mouth to say something. What should she say? What would the right thing be to do? Should she prioritise House Halen, or herself?</p>
<p class="cnNjNDY4MDQ4MDc4YzQ0ODY5MDdlZDA3YmVmNmVlNjAy">“I-” She began.</p>
<p class="cnM1M2YzYzJiZTYwMTRkYmY5MmI2ZTNmOWI5Nzc0YTc1">“It doesn’t matter what you say, my feelings aren’t going away. And besides…” Amelia raised her head and met her eyes. The human's cheeks were so red and hot Serena could probably fry an egg on them. “Besides, I saw you checking out my arse when I was doing my <em>katas</em>. So don’t pretend it’s not mutual… unless it really isn’t, alright?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NmUwNDA4MmUxMTQxNmM5MWQ1OGQ0NzBjYTM4NDcw">She had been caught! “I…” She struggled to meet Amelia’s eyes. Where had the human gotten this confidence!? “I suppose…” she began, her eyes flickering to Amelia’s pink lips. “I suppose it is… mutual,” she whispered, and Amelia broke out with the happiest expression Serena had ever seen on anyone ever.</p>
<p class="cnM5N2VkNmZjNTY4NDRhZjJhYjE4ZjE0YWMyMzNjYjg0">“That’s the best thing you could have said! So…” Amelia’s eyes flickered awkwardly downwards, towards Serena’s lips. “Umm… should we…” Amelia suddenly looked bashful, struggling to meet Serena’s eyes. “You know…” she muttered, looking to the side.</p>
<p class="cnM3YWEwOTgzOTMxMDRjYjc4OTQ1ZDU0MWIyZWQzOWQ0">Serena swallowed nervously, her heart pounding so loud in her ears that she could barely hear what Amelia was saying. She didn’t need to hear her, she could see her intention. Serena had told herself she needed to address her feelings and her attraction for this human.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWY4YmQ3MGQ5MDQxYjg4ZjVkMjhjMjhlMThlNmY0">And that was exactly what she was doing.</p>
<p class="cnNlMWVlYjQ4MTYxNDQ0MmQ4MDEwYjRjZTdlYjI0ZWQ4">Serena reached out, wrapping a hand around the back of Amelia’s head. “Come here, idiot,” she whispered, pulling her close.</p>
<p class="cnNhOWQwNGI3OTNmZTRhY2ZhNDY3MjYwNGI2MmZhYmUx">Until their lips met.</p>

      <description>Chapter Nineteen: The Greatlord of Kenhoro</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM4YzA4ZjM4ZWY1ZTQ5MGE5MTAwYjcyMmEwMzc0ZGE1"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNhMjYxMmE0NGEyMjQyOThhYTRmYTM1ZDJiYjFmYmZi">Amelia gripped the handhold Serena had created and pulled herself up before seeking the next one. Serena was just in front, using her magic to create little holes in the earth and stone. Together they ascended up the hole the <em>Salinas</em> Speaker had desperately created to escape.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDI4ZjEwMWU1MTRhODJiZmFhMmFmZDBhZGMxYmM1">Amelia could have jumped out easily, or used earth magic herself to bring the both of them to the surface. Instead, she was glad they had silently agreed to this slow ascent. It gave each of them valuable time to think and Amelia had plenty to think about.</p>
<p class="cnNhODhhOGY5MzBiZDQwMWI4NDFmZjljNDIxOGQ5YTZj">Her mind raced between the sheer embarrassment of breaking down and crying in front of Serena, and the celebratory feeling of delight and satisfaction she felt over the most amazing kiss anyone had ever experienced!</p>
<p class="cnNjN2I0Y2YxMWMyMzRhYzJiNzY4NTYzMzkwZWNhZWVh">Best of all, Serena had initiated! Nothing else could have assured Amelia her feelings were reciprocated as much as Serena’s hand wrapping around her head and pulling her in so gently and so boldly!</p>
<p class="cnNkYWUwZDU0OGY0MTRiYzBiMWZhZDA4MWI3ZThhOGMw">As she adjusted her limbs into the next set of handholds, Amelia ran her tongue over her lips. She could still feel that soft, sweet and yet somehow firm pressure from Serena’s lips. A phantom feeling of the kiss lay at the edge of her senses and that alone caused warmth and joy to ripple through her heart. If it were possible, she would have quite literally melted into a puddle of bliss.</p>
<p class="cnM0MmY1NGIzNGZkOTRjNmRiZTQ4NTAwNTZkY2RjYTlj">Luckily she hadn’t melted, although if she had she would just have healed herself back up! The one thing she couldn’t heal away was the lingering embarrassment of spilling everything in such an ugly way. The emotional outburst took Amelia by surprise, and she hadn’t realised quite how scared she was of everything, despite how safe and powerful she was.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTRkNDE3YWYzZjQ3NjhhNGM4ZTZhMGY4ZTdiYmE2">Most of all, she had been terrified of Serena being scared of her. She dreaded to imagine those crimson eyes looking at her in fear or apprehension. How happy she was when those eyes looked at her with only surprise and sympathy and in the end, when their lips broke apart, with desire.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTgxODc3NzE1NTQ3MzVhMjQ5ZTk2ZTUxNmUzYzYy">Amelia ran the memory of the kiss over and over again in her head as she ascended the last few meters out of the hole towards the powerful beings that had been waiting for them all this time.</p>
<p class="cnM4YmNjNWU4NjhmMDQ2YmQ4OTM3ODdhZGJlNDYxN2M5"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZDU5YTAxMGQxOTQ1M2Y4NjViYjYwZDIzYTkxYTg1"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNhMjViZWMyZTMxOTQ0ZmI5YzYxOGU1NDEwOGQxZDI1">Serena swallowed nervously. Clenching her fist against an open palm, she bowed deeply to the trio, who were waiting for them. She did not recognise two of them, but the third was unmistakable. Dressed in traditional silk Manwese clothing, the man hovered above the sandy cafe floor, crackling with blue energy that saturated the atmosphere with tension. Lei Gong the Stormlord, Greatlord and ruler of Kenhoro, had arrived.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjlmNTI5MmMxNjRmOGRiYjg3YzI2MWRiY2FlOGEy">“Stormlord,” she began, using the man’s preferred title while trying to keep her voice at the right tone. “I apologise for this disturbance that has befallen your city. May I explain what has happened here?” Serena stayed bowed, waiting for the reply.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmY4MzEzN2NlYzQyZmQ4ZDA5MmNlMmRjMDZlMGZi">“Look at this Lord-prospect!” Exclaimed one of the men she did not recognise. He had an arrogant posture and a long white beard. His clothes were expensive, but his hands were those of a fighter. “Do they not teach manners over in the Three Sisters? Hrmph! I told you, a native would not have caused this!”</p>
<p class="cnNhNmUwZjQzZTExZjQ1Nzc4YjE4MDY1YjBmZWEwMjky">“You are correct, Highlord Qiang,” said the other man, who was unknown to her. He had a noticeably slim build, sharp features, and narrow eyes. A single thick horn extruded from his forehead to the base of his skull, forming a kind of mohawk. “This one is Highlord Halen’s daughter? Is that correct?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDkyY2ZiMWEzODQyMDhhMjBjODIyYjNhODUwNDAx">“Correct,” uttered Serena, maintaining her bow.</p>
<p class="cnMxNmMzZGM5NzQwODRjYjM4OTM0NzZkOTAwN2I4NzI2">“And this one? Is this the human Speaker?”</p>
<p class="cnM0NmVkYTZhMmNmYzQ5ZTNhMmIyNDQ2NzMwZTk1Mjdl">Serena turned her head slightly to see Amelia had joined her in her act of submission. At least she could read the room. The golden hair was now dirty with sand, dust, sweat and blood and had clumped together awkwardly. Through a gap in the hair, Serena could make out those pink lips that not so long ago she had…</p>
<p class="cnMzMTM2M2EzOTM3MDQ1MTJiMTM5Yjg3OTQ2OTQxMzM3">No. Now wasn’t the time.</p>
<p class="cnMwMWYwYTcyN2QyYzQwZTg4MjBmODNkMjRjZTZmNWJk">“This is Amelia Thornheart,” Serena said. "Speaker Thornheart is a native of Karligard, a travelling healer that I have secured for House Halen.” A few moments lapsed, the only sound being the imposing crackling of the Stormlord’s energy as little bolts of blue lightning whipped up miniature sandstorms.</p>
<p class="cnNhZWIyNDE2MWExNjRlNjJiZTUzZWY0YjcxOWZjYWZk">“Lord-prospect Halen, a word of advice,” said the unknown man who she was certain was another Highlord. “When in the presence of other Cascadian Lords, especially <em>a Greatlord</em>, it is seen impolite to hold onto <em>Narean</em>. Some of us might even take it as a threat.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NWY0YWMxZGNhMDQxNDRiMjM4MzQyNmRhMjkyOWQw">“Ah! My sincere apologies!” Serena had forgotten she was still holding onto the Word. It had cooled down, the hellfire on her horns and flaming tail had vanished inside the hole, but she had still maintained a grip on the divine aether inside her. She was in a state known as <em>simmering</em>. A battle state allowing Speakers to react quickly without expending too much effort.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGIwYmI0ZDI0MDQzZWE5NjMwNTQ3OGQ3ZTYxNTQ0">Serena released her will on the aether inside her and felt it escape as it crossed the boundary into the realm of the gods. In its place, her aether reserves recovered as she absorbed the normal atmospheric aether. It was happening faster than usual; the atmosphere was saturated with aether with the Stormlord's presence.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTA0ZDJlMzE4NjQxZjg5MTZkZDRkZjE3ZDg5Nzkz">“Forgive me, but I don’t recall your name, Highlord,” Serena said, trying to sound apologetic.</p>
<p class="cnM2NmE3ODczOWEzZjRhMGNhNWQyNmY2MzJmYzA4YmE0">“Ha! This is what happens when you lock yourself away year after year, my friend!” Highlord Qiang laughed softly. “What’s the point in having so many great achievements if those who use them don’t know your face!?”</p>
<p class="cnNjM2Y4NmE5NWJlMDQyYTZiODIzYTJmMWFhY2Q2MTQ4">“My dear friend Qiang,” the man said in mirth, “Isn’t the achievement greater if it is done without the expectation of fame and glory?” In reply, Highlord Qiang smashed his two fists together. Serena could see they had seen battle many times.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTUzZGI4MGM0OTRjMTY5MTBlMjYzNTA2NjQxODkw">“Fame and glory make the achievement, and the achievement makes fame and glory! Can’t have one without the other!” Highlord Qiang punctuated his statement by bringing his fists together once again.</p>
<p class="cnMyMmQxN2I3N2JhYTRiMDE5MWE2NjFmZmUzZjMxMmNh">“Nevertheless…” the man turned his attention back to Serena and Amelia. “I am Highlord Ru. I don’t expect you to recognise my face. I rarely leave my laboratory. Stand up straight, both of you. Too much bowing is impolite.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTYxZWQxYWNhNDQwNWY5NGFhMzA5YTI3Y2FkZDM4">Serena and Amelia both straightened. Serena examined Highlord Ru’s face. His face didn’t ring any bells, but his name did. She had definitely heard of it before. She turned the name over in her mind. With a glance at Amelia, she saw that she wasn’t looking at any of the trio in front of them at all.</p>
<p class="cnMyNzZkM2E5YjkzZjQ4NzA4ZDMyZjcyMzkxMzg5ZTg1">Instead, she had a puzzled expression on her face and was looking at some unidentifiable spot in the sky behind the Greatlord and two Highlords. Serena glanced in the direction Amelia was looking at, but seeing nothing, turned her eyes back to Highlord Ru. Hopefully they would forgive the human for being a little rude. As she thought about pre-emptively apologising, the name <em>Ru</em> suddenly triggered a memory.</p>
<p class="cnM0YWRjYzg2YTQ3ZjQ0MDE4ZTNhYzA0MWViYTM0NzM4">“Highlord Ru, are you perhaps the same Ru of the <em>Ru-Barfield </em>Theorem?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MzdlMTJmNTFmNDRmYzBhMmYzNTM5ZGZmYWViYmNj">“The very same! See, friend? Sometimes a name is all you need!” Highlord Ru said with a smile of pride on his sharp face.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTJhNDhjNjliNzQ5NThhOWNlNzUxNDY5MGY2M2Zj">“You invented the lifting engine! The equation that took demonkind to the skies!” Despite the tension in the atmosphere and the absolute monster crackling with energy at the back, Serena couldn’t help but blurt out the statement. “You’re the Aetherlord!”</p>
<p class="cnMzZDJkMzk4OTZiODRjZDJhNmQ5ODI3ZjIxZGRiYjJm">“Ha! This one even knows my title! Yes, together with Highlord Barfield, the lord of the lumina, we discovered the equation. It was a joint effort, and so I cannot take all the credit. We only did the mathematics; it was the Centralis engineers that put it to the test!” Highlord Ru held a fan to his mouth. “Although if you ever meet with Barfield, and he pretends he did most of the work, give him a good smack for me, would you?”</p><span class="cjczZjUxOTA2OGY4OTQ2YTliODg0YzdhYjM0YjhkMDc3"><br/>This tale has been unlawfully lifted without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4NjY0ZTQxMDA2MzQ5ZTM4Y2FiMDNhNGRhMWJlOGY1">Serena smiled nervously. “I wouldn’t dare, Highlord Ru…. Is it true the Empress herself gave you a Golden Eagle for the achievement?”</p>
<p class="cnNkYjdkYjRkOGFiOTQ4NDY4MWMwNzc5NjVhMDAxNWVh">“Oh yes, I think it’s in some box somewhere. Hmm… I might have melted it down for an experiment… Oh well.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNjQzNWNjOWIxYzQ4NjE5MTRhMDA0NjU0NjMwMWE3">She felt herself involuntarily gulp at that. Surely the highlord was jesting. He couldn’t have done that, right? Melt down a <em>Golden Eagle</em> for an experiment?</p>
<p class="cnMyNWE4NDVjNWM4NjQ0ZGE4MDM3NTc0ODY1MTljMTIy">“Turning to the matter at hand…” energy lashed out in the atmosphere, vaporising small rocks near the Stormlord’s feet. Just the act of him speaking oversaturated the air with aether, causing an uncomfortable pressure to build up in Serena’s ears. The Greatlord’s eyes shone white with power, and when he spoke his breath was misted with dense aether. “Lord-prospect, I have seven dead and more injured. Explain the events that transpired here.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYWMzYWEzZTA2MjRlOTA4ZTg3MjRjMGFjZjU1YmUw">Serena took a breath and glanced at Amelia. The human had stopped being fixated on the sky and was paying attention to the Stormlord, although her eyes kept flicking back to that nondescript location above. Serena began explaining the events of that day, starting with her arrival at the Highguard. She detailed her investigation and suspicions and how she had come to the cafe to plan their next move when two Speakers attacked them.</p>
<p class="cnNkODM1ZGI0MWVmYTQ1Y2U5N2FhMTNmYjNhYTU3NDJi">The highlords occasionally interrupted, seemingly very interested in the descriptions and behaviour of the <em>Salinas</em> and <em>Turana</em> Speakers. Serena did not hide Amelia’s part, explaining how she healed Serena and protected the both of them as the building collapsed.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDJmNjUwNDhiMjRkYzlhM2QyMTE1Y2Q5OWFmZWE5">What happened in the little pocket of rubble, she didn’t share.</p>
<p class="cnM5NGQ3MWZmNGE4NDQ4NzE5ODk3NTVkMjRjMjBiOTQ4">“Qiang, thoughts?” The Stormlord asked at the end of her explanation. He hadn’t shown much changes in expression or emotion and Serena was thankful for that. The constant knot of tension his presence caused her put her in an uneasy state. This man could probably overwhelm her in a second.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjRmMGMyYThlMDQxZWM5NjFkYjgwODFiNDc1Y2Qy">Unless Amelia had something to say about it.</p>
<p class="cnM0NWY1OWQ2ZmM0NDQ2MjNiNzFhNTFmYTMzOGNjMjk1">“It’s strange, Greatlord.” Qiang turned, bowing a little as he addressed the ruler of Kenhoro. “These groups generally prefer not to smuggle their goods through a business in central, often preferring an operation in the outer rings, or on ground level. For them to send two Speakers to fight in the city limits? To kill someone the papers referred to as a <em>war hero</em> this very morning?” The highlord cast an eye in her direction. “There is something more here than mere drugs or weapons.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNmZkMjYwN2Q2MzRiN2ZhOTdhODgwN2Y0YmE4Yjc4">“Bigger than these <em>Crimson Reapers</em> as well,” Highlord Ru added. “Their leader isn’t a Speaker. The two attackers, as described, don’t match any of the rogue Speakers we know about in the East. These mercenaries have involved themselves in something too big for their boots. I’ll have the seismic stations keep an eye out. Perhaps we will pick up the movements of this escaping Earthlord.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDE3ZWVmNWUyYTQ0YjE4ZDJiZmJlZDdjNzIxNjE4">“Do that now, Highlord Ru,” the Stormlord commanded. Highlord Ru gave a deep bow to his master, and a smaller polite one to Serena and Amelia before smoothly exiting. “Secure the Highguard, Highlord Qiang. Arrest and interrogate them all.” Highlord Qiang gave his own deep bow and turned to leave.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzQ2ZDE2N2M4NjRiNTFiMTU2NmEwOGJkOGM2ZTc0">“Highlord Qiang!” Serena called out, bowing again. She was too nervous to ask the Stormlord himself a question. The highlord turned towards her with a neutral expression.</p>
<p class="cnNmNWFmNDU0N2VmYjQ1ZmI4MGNiOGNmZDkwZGQzNmMz">“Yes, Lord-prospect?” He asked.</p>
<p class="cnM5NTkyNDFhZjU4OTQ5MTdhYmI5NzdmMjEzYzNmYTZk">“Among the intelligence agents that were attacked…” Serena swallowed, “Were any of them… a male officer?” Highlord Qiang stared at her for a few moments.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDE3NGI4YTE0MjQ2NjliOTA3OTc3NzI0MGYzYWJj">“Officer Adachi was not among the dead,” the Highlord said, prompting Serena to breathe out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzU5YWY1N2Y0ODRjZGVhZGY0YjlkNDM5YTZkYTJm">“And… forgive me, but there were two cafe workers. Two trainees of the academy here. I-”</p>
<p class="cnM0NTkyYzdjMTRiZjRjMThiYzY4MzMzZDZkODA5YjI5">“They are dead.”</p>
<p class="cnNlODk1ZThlMjUzZDQzZjI5Mjk0MTQ2NzVkODM0MDE4">“Oh.” A knot rose in her throat.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGY1ODYzNmMwZTRhYmFhZTE4YTM3YmVmZWQzYmE2">“Now excuse me, Lord-prospect, I am the commander of the city's security, and I have a part of the city to secure.” Highlord Qiang left, leaving the pair of them and the crackling Greatlord.</p>
<p class="cnM4MGIyNzc0Y2NjNTRlYjc4ZmM0YzM1OGMyMjQwMmM4">“To cause such trouble in my city,” the Stormlord said coldly. “You are both under house arrest. You will follow me to my estate. You-” the man suddenly stopped talking. A frown appeared on his face. The greatlord turned, facing away from them with his face tilted up to some invisible point in the sky.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTcyMWE5YzBkNTQ0Y2E5MjExNjIwZTk3MmQwY2U4">“I do not understand, Father,” the greatlord said. He was quiet for a moment. Serena couldn’t hear or see who the man was talking to. She strained her senses, looking to the sky, trying to detect anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTFhMTVmOGY2ZjRjYTdiMmZhMGQ2YjNmM2FhYzBk">“Who told you this?” The Stormlord questioned the sky, a note of confusion in his voice. A full half minute passed before he spoke again. “I understand, Father.” The greatlord turned to them. “Speaker Halen, Speaker Thornheart.” The shining white eyes seemed to linger on Amelia. “You are free to go by decree of my Overlord.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMzgyZTE5NjMwNjQ0MzY4MmY4MWU2ODFlOGJkNTIz">“<em>The Overlord?” </em>Serena couldn’t help but exclaim. She frantically cast her eyes to the sky again but failed once more to detect anything other than clouds. Was the Overlord so powerful he was outside her ability to perceive him? Was he really there? Watching them?</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmI0ZjQ1MWI2NjRlMGI4MzNlMGQ4OWUyYmZkMWUz">“Thanks!” Amelia exclaimed, smiling. "Would you like me to heal the injured?”</p>
<p class="cnMzYjAxNTFiMmMyMjQ3MDZiN2FiMTMwOWIyNjBiZGRm">“That will not be necessary,” intoned the Stormlord. “Lord Yulan is down the street. I suggest you find somewhere to reside outside of Central for a few days.” He turned his eyes to Serena. “I hope your stay at Kenhoro has no more surprises and that you leave when the repairs to your ship are done. I will send more workers to assist.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDk3OGUxZDI3MjQ3YWM4YjJiZjNlMDZmZTI5Zjdi">“I… Thank you, Stormlord,” Serena clasped her hand and bowed deeply. Amelia did the same. Without replying, a bolt of lightning struck the man, and he travelled upwards at great speed before flying to somewhere else in the city outside of her vision and senses.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDVhZTQ0YTI3MTRkYjJiZjQ5MmVlMTFiOGJkZGMx">For a moment, all was silent.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGVmNDljMzYxODQ0YzU5YTU3MzQ4MDVjZDIxM2Ez">“Bye!” Amelia was waving to a point in the sky. Serena looked at her with a mouth open.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDU4NjQ4NzVkZTRjNWJhYWRkN2VhZjNkMzdhZDIx">“Did you just… wave <em>bye</em> to the Overlord?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNmVkYWZmYTcyZTQ3MDFhNmYxOTUwMDExZDZkYmM3">“Yeah! He’s super interesting!”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDg5ZTIzNjVlMjQ5MGNiNTcyZmY5Y2ZhMzNmNDNj">Seven hells! What next, tea with the Empress!? Serena rested her head against the palm of her hand for a moment, gathering herself. “Let’s go. Lord Yulan should be just down the street. Uh… we don’t look great, do we? Here…” Serena found some paper towels that had survived the fight. “Use these,” she said, offering some to Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWI4YmRkMDhhMTRkOThiOTZhNGU1ZTA4ZDMyMzFi">“No need! Come here!” Amelia reached out a hand, and when Serena touched it some spell was activated. All the dirt, sweat and blood vanished from their hair, clothes and bodies.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTQzYjI1MDJhZDQ1NzFhYjFlYjExODA2ZDAzZGVh">“I thought you knew a cleaning spell…” Serena murmured, examining how pristine she was suddenly. “Is this what you used on me in the medical bay on the ship?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NWNiNWE4NmM3MTRkMzg5MGFkYWQ5MjY3NmZjYTVm">“That’s right!” Amelia grinned happily, “If you ever want to skip a shower, let me know! Although…” She wrinkled her nose, “Even though it makes you perfectly clean, I still feel like having a wash, you know? Can we find another hotel, one that doesn’t hate humans?”</p>
<p class="cnM4NTFjN2RlODgzODRjYWU5OGNiZTQ5YWMyYmYxYTU1">“Sure…” Serena nodded, “Let’s find Lord Yulan. He has all kinds of friends in the industry.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NGUyMjJjNTkyYzQxNGY4ZmMyNTk5OWMxZmRmNTJi">Together they made their way down the street, and as the Greatlord had said, they found Lord Yulan pacing frantically, looking worried.</p>
<p class="cnNlMzU1ZTFkN2JmODQ5YjVhN2NkYWZhZTAzYWE1Zjdk">“Serena! Miss Thornheart!” Lord Yulan exclaimed, relief written on his face. “You’re alright! What happened!? Did you see the Greatlord!? What power!”</p>
<p class="cnNiMmUyOGE0YWEwYTRiZGY5M2FiYzMzYmI5MmZmM2Rl">“Glad to see you’re alright, old man,” Serena said, giving him a hug. “There’s a lot to talk about. Highlord Qiang is in the process of raiding the Highguard, so I don’t know if you’ll be able to go back there for a while.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYTllZWQxZjc4YjQzOWQ4YmU4ZDRiZDk3ZDkyMTRh">“This is going to be <em>terrible</em> for business,” sighed Lord Yulan. “So, what’s happening with you two?” He eyed them both.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjY4YzI4OWIxMjQyNDFhZmI2NzQ0ZDE1OTIzMDM4">“Are there any hotels outside of the city centre that would be happy to have us stay? Any friends owing you favours?”</p>
<p class="cnM4M2E1MjJjZjBkNzQ2MWI5ZDQ2NzM4YmE4Y2QwOWI5">“Hmm…” Lord Yulan scratched his jaw. “I can think of a few. Actually, I know just the place. Let’s jump a tram, and then it’s a short walk.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNjI5MDY5M2YwZDQ2MzRhMmFjNzVjZmE0YmI5MWQ3">The three of them left the area. A crowd had formed, but the city guards were massed in great numbers and were keeping the situation under control. They slipped through a side alley, guided by a guard, before jumping on a tram.</p>
<p class="cnMzOGE2NmEwODE4ZjRlZjA5ZWQ2YWFiNGNkZjk1ZTdm">The three of them rode in silence, not wanting to speak in public about the events that transpired. When they jumped off and began walking through quieter streets, Lord Yulan bombarded her with questions and she did her best to answer. Of certain matters that occurred in the hole as well as the part about the Overlord she kept secret. No need to complicate things further.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTk0NjNhOWM0YzRlZjM4MjQzMzFiNDYzYmE4OWE0">They soon arrived at a large inn on the outskirts. Where Highguard was tall, this place was stocky and wide. Serena found out that in the centre was a private garden, and the building and its two floors were wrapped around it. It was a modest, quiet inn. Perfect for their needs.</p>
<p class="cnM0MGZkY2E5ZGUwYjQyMWM4OGFhZjRhZTFiYTZlNGVh">Lord Yulan was welcomed by the owner with a smile of joy, and the two nattered about all kinds of irrelevant things before Yulan broached the subject of them staying.</p>
<p class="cnMzNWQwMGQ5MmI0MTRjM2I5MTEzNGQ5OTYyODI5NTgw">“I am Mister Weng, the owner of this establishment.” Mister Weng bowed to Serena and Amelia. “It is a great honour to have not only two Speakers stay here, but ones who saved my friend Lord Yulan from such a troubling situation. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.” Weng prostrated himself even further.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDZiOWRhMjE1YTQ3NzQ4YzUyYTI3OGMyM2ZlZDgy">“Mister Weng, I take it you have a room for us, then?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmMzZjEwZjkyYTQ2MWJhNjIzMTg0YmViOTkxNGNh">“Of course, Speaker Halen. You are lucky that we still have a room remaining. The rest are occupied by festival-goers. I shall make it available to you free of charge, for as long as you wish.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNGZiMWNmNWU5MTRlOTdhZTNlMDg5MWYyNzM3YWRj">“No need. House Halen will pay the invoice. We won’t impose on you that much, Mister Weng.”</p>
<p class="cnNiN2VhMGNiZmEzNzRmYzNiMTcxYThlMDNiMzlkNDVj">“Your generosity knows no bounds, Speaker.” Weng had a pleased smile on his face. “Here are the keys. My receptionist will guide you to your room.” He handed Serena a large brass key.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTNiNWY3MWNjNDQ3NzY4NmUxZTgwZTE1NGM4NjU1">“I’ll let you two kids get on with it, then!” Said Lord Yulan cheerfully.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWNlN2Q4YTc4NDRkZWQ5MmI5ZTIxOWY2YzNlYWVi">“Where are you going, old man?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNTgwYjc4MTU1MTRlMmNiN2I5NmUxZjk2Y2U1MDg1">“Home, of course! I don’t live in the Highguard! Need to make sure my house is still standing!” Lord Yulan gave her a wave, “I’ll impose upon you two in a few days, I imagine I have a dreadful amount of paperwork to go over!” With that, Lord Yulan vanished, leaving Serena and Amelia alone with the owner and receptionist.</p>
<p class="cnNiY2ZlN2VkODVmYzQ1Y2E4ODE0MDI4NTA1ZDUzYjNi">“Speaker Halen, Speaker Thornheart. If you could follow me.” The receptionist - a short, neatly-dressed human - bowed to them.</p>
<p class="cnM1OGM3MmM5MjliMzQwOGY5NTY2NjdmMGM1ODhmNGUw">“Enjoy your stay!” Weng called out as they were led up a flight of stairs.</p>
<p class="cnNiNGI4MGRiMTMxODQ0MDY5OWVkNzFjM2YyNWU2MDQ0">The receptionist led them around the terrace that surrounded the garden before coming to a stop at a door. The human bowed politely. “Here we are. There is a bell you can ring inside. It's connected to the reception. Is there anything else I can do for you?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YjUzZjc3NDE2ZDQ3Zjk5NWY1MTY4NzUwODQwNzZh">“No, that’s all for now,” Serena said, and the receptionist left them alone.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzE5MjcyZTIxYzQxYjFhOTZhMmU3M2NiMGJhZjkz">She placed the key in the lock and opened the door. Looking inside, she swept her eyes over the room before closing the door and turning to Amelia awkwardly.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTU3NjMxMWM4ZDQ1NTlhMTBmMzY2ZTI2NDY4MTg2">“Umm…” She muttered, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzU0MTY3N2I0OTQyYTE5YzYwMWE4ZGQzNmI2ZDAx">“What is it?” Amelia asked, pushing open the door and looking inside herself. “Oh my!” She exclaimed, flashing a look at Serena, cheeks going red.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTEzN2VjOWFiNDRhY2ViZDlkZmY5ZDczY2FmOTgz">The room was beautiful and luxurious, but one thing stood out among the luxuries that caused heat to rise in both Serena’s and Amelia’s bodies.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWNmNDJiYmMzZjQ2MWY5NDQ0ZTE4MDgzMTZjNjNi">The lone bed that lay teasingly in the centre of the room.</p>

      <description>Chapter Twenty: Two Girlfriends And Many Drinks</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNlMzI5MTE1YmVmZDQwYjJiY2UwZTRiMzk5ODRhOWIy"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmM1ZDhjYTlhYjRkYjc4MWQzNzFmZjJkYTM1MTQz">The door swung shut behind them - leaving them in silence - staring at the bed whose very existence made Amelia’s heart race. Amelia cast an eye sideways to see Serena with a nervous expression on her face. The demon was chewing her lips.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTI2MjAyZWM3NjRiZDM4Y2Q0ODI2ZTI3MjE5ZTZk">“Well!” Amelia exclaimed as cheerfully as she could. “It looks very… cosy, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNmIyNDg4NGVkYTQxMzA4NDQ3YWY2YjJhZTljYzhm">“I will return to reception. Have them bring another bed,” said Serena, turning to the door. Amelia intercepted her, throwing her arms wide and blocking her passage.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjQ3YWExYTJhMTRlYzc4N2Y0MjA5OGFjYmViZjU5">“You can’t!” Amelia cried, “We’ve already imposed so much on Mister Weng! We can’t bother him any more!”</p>
<p class="cnNjN2IzODczMWNmNDRhY2Y5MGUyMjc1OGJkOTNiNGMx">“We’re paying customers; it’s his job to be bothered.” Serena crossed her arms and tried to look stern, although her flushed cheeks somewhat spoiled the act.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzMzMWZmODEzNzQzYWM5MTY5NmY2OGYyZGJiMzVh">“It’s the last room, Mister Weng must be very busy running a full establishment! We can bother him tomorrow!” Amelia wasn’t going to let this gift from the gods go unused. This was something to fight over!</p>
<p class="cnM5MzhmNmI1OGJlYjQyMDhhMmUwNzhiODI2NDMzYTVj">“Don’t be silly. We’re <em>Speakers</em>. It’s probably an oversight. They’ll be delighted to fix it…” Serena trailed off slightly at the end, the conviction in her voice fading, which was all Amelia needed to go on the attack.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2M2YzY4MTg5ZDRiYTZiYTQ0MjUxZmJkMmZiZGFl">“It’s not a problem, so it doesn’t need to be fixed! Right!?”</p>
<p class="cnNkODM5NmQ2ZTlhMzQ0ZmM5Mjg4Nzk0Yjc0YzljYzNh">“W-what are you suggesting!? We <em>sleep</em> together!?” Serena’s cheeks had gone fully red, and her voice was wavering. Now was the time to be strong, to strike the finishing blows!</p>
<p class="cnMxYTBhNDUxNTA3MTQ0OTc4NWE2YzVhZWY4ZjY4MDg1">“Of course! We like each other, don’t we!? And besides…” Amelia puffed her cheeks out and shuffled her feet while trying to maximise her cute appearance. “... When you hold me, I feel so <em>warm</em> and <em>safe</em>. Like nothing could ever hurt me…”</p>
<p class="cnM1YzdmMTU1N2M1NTRiZDE5ZTllYTMyMmYxYjliOTVi">A critical strike! Serena took a half-step back and her right hand went to her chest. “Y-you… you… ah!” It was all too much for Serena and she turned away from Amelia. “You can’t say such shameless things so easily!” Serena seemed to find her voice when she wasn’t looking directly at her.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWFiMTQwOGY1NzQxYzhhOWE1ODMyNWViZDMzNzAw">Amelia took the chance and shuffled up behind her. “Can I… put my arms around you?” She asked quietly.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTMxMmFjMTk2YjQ1N2E5NzQxNGJjNDRiNjIzOThi">“Why?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NGRkZDk3NzA2NzQwMWU5ZjJlZThiNjU5MGI2MjU0">“Do I need a reason to embrace the person I like? Mmm?” Serena was quiet for a few seconds before the whispered response came.</p>
<p class="cnM2YzMyMTcxNDAzODQwMzliMTcyZjI0YWUzMTBiNmI5">“Do… as you like…”</p>
<p class="cnMwNjc4ZDY0ZmUxNzQzNTc4NWZhNzExN2Y0ZjE1OGQ1">Amelia slipped her arms around Serena’s waist. Unfortunately, the captain’s outfit prevented her from being as close as she wanted, but this level of intimacy was still satisfying. Serena was just a bit too tall for her to rest her chin on her shoulder, so she turned her head to the side and rested her cheek against Serena's upper back.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWNiYWFmNjMwMjQwNjk5Yzk2ZDJhY2NjN2MxZjBj">“I’m sorry if I pushed things too fast…” Amelia whispered, squeezing Serena a little. “I just, really, <em>really</em> like you. I think I have from the moment we first met. Not just romantically… but physically as well.” Oh my, it was so much easier to say embarrassing things in this position! She would have to make this a habit.</p>
<p class="cnM3MzI4NmMyMzMyYTQxMDlhMTYwNmZmZDAxMWU1MjM2">“The thought of cuddling with you makes me so happy, and we can’t exactly do it in the hammocks on the ship, right? So I want to make the most of it while we can. That’s all I want! Just cuddling! We don’t have to do anything else…” She was blabbering now, “... but if we could kiss some more that would be perfect, if you’re still, you know… into me…”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmRiZTgyYTllYTRhZDM5ODVjYmZlNzY2ZGI1NmE3">Serena let out an audible sigh. “You really don’t know when to stop, do you?” the demon said. Amelia felt Serena place her hands on her own.</p>
<p class="cnMzODRiOTMxZWFiZjRhYWViYTMwNGY1ODdhMGMyZDJh">“No! And I don’t want to stop!” Amelia gave Serena another squeeze.</p>
<p class="cnMyZTJlZjBmZGY5YTRhOTc5NzgwZjQ0NWU2NWNhYjY4">“It’s just… there’s supposed to be a period of courting. Because I’m a Lord-prospect, and daughter of a Highlord. At least, um… three moons, I believe it was? It’s supposed to take time, so the two families can iron out any problems…”</p>
<p class="cnNmMjhmM2Y2NDlkMTQxMWNiNGJiMDA1ODAyZjdkNmNl">“But, I don’t have any family, in this world or the other one. It’s just me!” Amelia exclaimed, trying not to let the atmosphere drop too much. “I don’t think anybody did <em>courting</em> where I’m from. We just went on dates and got to know each other!"</p>
<p class="cnNiZGViNzNkZDIwNTRiMGFiNWRiZjEzZDgzZWZlMWU4">“Dates?”</p>
<p class="cnMwZTY3MTdjYjFmYjRkNDBhNGNlMzc1YjMyMDY2NTY1">“Like going out and doing something together - eating a meal, watching a play - something like that.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjYzNDI5ZWMzNjQxNzA5MjQyNzFjZTBjNGI1N2Ji">Serena pried Amelia’s arms off and turned to face her. The demon was smiling, and coupled with the flushed cheeks and crimson eyes, Amelia once again found herself taken back by how <em>attracted</em> she was to Serena.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDU2M2U2ZjMwNTQyNDdhZTdhNzkwNDFhNjFmZTYy">“We can do that…” Serena said, holding hands with Amelia, interlocking their fingers. “I just want you to understand that… same-sex relationships are frowned upon. The Holy Demon Bible, which the Empress <em>herself</em> compiled from the ancient scripture, strongly discourages them.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMzg0ZDg0ZjA0NjQ3MzdiNGU5Zjc2ZjMzMzhkNjkx">“Why?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYTJmMDM1MTI3OTQ4ZWRhNWIzMzg5ZGNjOTFkZGM3">“Well,” Serena suddenly looked bashful, “The scripture has a heavy emphasis on… multiplying demonkind, and I guess us being two women would make that… difficult.” Serena closed her eyes for a few seconds before opening them.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTVkZDlkMDM3OTQ3ZTJhYTY4ZmQ4MzdkMzQ4MjIw">“Okay, but that won’t stop us from trying, right?” Another critical blow! Serena released their hands and pulled Amelia into a tight embrace. The demon sure did give great hugs!</p>
<p class="cnNlZDY2YWU4MzdjYTRkNTFhNDRkMDJlYzgxM2VkMGU5">“Stupid idiot,” Serena said, ruffling her golden hair. “I can’t look at you when you say such awfully forward things, idiot!” Amelia had her cheeks pressed against Serena’s collar, which meant if she rotated her head just a little she was in the perfect position too…</p>
<p class="cnNhODhmODRjYTg4YzQzZmI5ODUzODEzZjE1NjM5OTU2">“I’m sorry,” Amelia said, giving Serena a small kiss on the neck. “There must be something wrong with me, because I’m actually addicted to making you flustered.” Another peck against the skin. “I must be a pervert or something because I love seeing that stern captain act break down. It honestly excites me…” Another kiss.</p>
<p class="cnNiODQ4NmM4MDM2MTRjODBiOGE2NzJhNGYwY2MyYjY1">“This is going to be so much trouble…” Serena mumbled, pulling Amelia off and looking into her eyes. The demon placed one hand on Amelia’s waist and another behind her head and, like before, pulled their lips together.</p>
<p class="cnNiMGIxOTNhYTJkYzQ4NjhhMjE5NWQzOWNkMzMyMjA5">“Mmm”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmU1NjRjN2E2NzRjMGJiNTU5MTRmNTVkNGEwMDAw">“Ahh”</p>
<p class="cnNhNTZmZDhiYzZmYTQ4ZDg4ZjZlZDVhYmMyOGY5OTJk">“Mmm”</p>
<p class="cnNlMGY3NWQ4MzgxYTQ1NDJhNzM1NmVjMGQzOWUyYTIz">“Ow!”</p>
<p class="cnNlYjRiMGU0MmIyYzRkYmE5ODlmMzI0MGMwZTJhMWI2">“Sorry!” Amelia exclaimed, pulling away. “I wasn’t expecting your tongue!” She giggled at the annoyed-looking demon. “See,” Amelia said, “It’s much easier to look at each other if we keep doing things like this, right!?”</p>
<p class="cnM4YmRjOTdjYTM2ZjQxNmRhMjNkZTY1MjI0NjA4Yjg5">“Tsk! That logic is…” Serena paused, rolling her eyes. “I suppose it makes some sense.” Serena placed a hand on each of Amelia’s shoulders. “Look, our relationship isn’t <em>illegal</em>. But there are many who would be opposed. My father included. He’s-” Serena was cut off as Amelia pulled her into hug.</p>
<p class="cnM5NmU2ZmI4YjY4NTRkODhiMjM2NGI0OGViMTg0MWEy">“You said <em>our relationship!</em>” Amelia exclaimed before looking into those crimson eyes. “So we’re definitely dating or courting or whatever? You’re my girlfriend? I can call you that?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMjNmMWIwZDZiZTRkNDg4MDNhZjg3NDI0YjM0NDQw">“I… suppose so.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OWUxZDUzZTI1MTRhZjk5MDUxMWYyYzUwM2ZlMmNh">“Serena Halen,” Amelia said, grinning wildly, “My girlfriend!”. She tilted her head and gave Serena a kiss on the cheek. “So what’s this about our relationship? People aren’t going to throw rocks at us or anything?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MTE5YmU3NmU1MTRmYWE5OWRjOTEyZWJiNGFkOTgz">“Uh, no,” Serena’s eyes narrowed. “And if they did, I’d collect those hands and decorate the ship with them.” Those crimson eyes didn’t seem to be joking. “The point is, I won’t deny we’re… together if I’m directly asked. I won’t disrespect either you or myself by pretending otherwise. It’s just that we should avoid public displays of affection. Such things are unbecoming of nobility, and doubly so that I’m a Speaker, and triply so that I’m a commissioned officer.”</p>
<p class="cnNlZDlkMzY0YWYyNTRjMjA5NjYwYTc3MzQ2MmFmMzI0">“Alright, that makes sense. I won’t go screaming about it from the rooftops then, even if I want to!”</p>
<p class="cnNjNDVmMDhmZDYxZjQ0NmNhMTBhZDRjMGQxYTkwNDFm">“Thank you,” Serena looked relieved. “Even when it does become known, whether as an open secret or formally announced - we would still be immune from most public criticism as we are, after all, two powerful Speakers. But you will hear things said behind our backs. Most people aren’t quite aware of how good a Speaker’s hearing is. Some of the more… passionate people will use rather… unkind words when they think you cannot hear them.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NDdkY2QwOTdkOTQzMTE5ZWFkZjViYTZjMzc1YzBl">“And I should, what? Let them be?” Amelia frowned. She didn’t want to go around starting fights and picking battles all the time, but it felt wrong to just… let it happen.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzU4NDVlNDdlYzQ2NTZiODEzZjA3Mjg2OTU4YjQ1">“If things are said behind your back, best to report it back to me, and we can start figuring out our allies and enemies. If it’s said to your face…” Serena sighed. “I know you don’t like fighting, but if you break a few noses when it happens, it’ll stop it from continuing. As long as you don’t break another Speaker’s nose, it's unlikely it’ll cause any real problems. You are a <em>Speaker</em> after all, and once you’ve been granted citizenship, you’ll have the <em>Speaker’s Privilege</em>. You’ll be permitted to take the law into your own hands, to an extent.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NzJhZGViNDI4YTQxYTRiZDBhMmViNzU3OTBhZTIz">“Insulting a Speaker is against the law?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YmY4ZjFhYjY3OTQ0MGM4Mjk0M2VhOGI2ZDU1NDM5">“To a small degree. Speakers have a right to seek retribution for a slight against them. It’s an old law but still used today. Think about it, Speakers are worthy of divine communion with the gods. Society treats us a step higher than others, for the gods themselves have sanctioned and chosen us. You will also have the right to fine people up to ten denarii if they cause you problems, although don’t use that against any nobility.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTZkOWUyOWQ4ZTQ0NmRhY2FiNWI1MjMxZGJkZmYx">Well, the more Serena told her about Speakers, the more excited Amelia became! “When will I become a citizen?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmYmQxZGRmMWQyMjQyYjhiNzZjNWU4MGRjNDBjYzg2">“There’s an old friend of mine from the academy here in Kenhoro. His name is Aiden Adachi and he was sent by Centralis Intelligence to do a personality profile on you. You’re supposed to meet him during the festival. Although…” Serena looked thoughtful, “We might as well meet him earlier, given the drama that just transpired.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNDdkMmI2ZGQwYTQ4NjRiNjIyMGRhNTM4MjYzMWI4">“Personality profile?”</p>
<p class="cnM5MjYxZjY4OGE3MDQwYzhiMTNiYjg5ODY5YzY2NDNl">“Yes. He’ll be chatting with you and making a report on your temperament and other personality traits. It’s mostly to make sure you’re not crazy, which you obviously are-”</p>
<p class="cnMxYmU1OTNlZTYxZjQ3MzRiMmY0OWNlNDJhNjFmN2Fh">“Hey!”</p>
<p class="cnNiMjE0MzI0NzFhMDRjNTJiOGZlOWY4ZTRkNDUwNmYw">“Well, crazy in bad ways. Obviously, you’re crazy about <em>me</em>, right?” Serena gave her a smile bordering on arrogance. Where had this demon gotten this confidence? Well, Amelia couldn’t refute it. Serena was correct after all, Amelia was crazy about her.</p>
<p class="cnMzMGYwY2NkNWY1NzQzYzE4MzE3NjQxMGNlNzQwZjg2">“Fine, fine. So if I pass this test, they make me a citizen?”</p>
<p class="cnNiY2NkZTE4NDA2YjRiOWM4MGI4ODM0OTE1ODhiNWE0">“An offer will be made. Honestly, I can’t see why they wouldn’t. They’ll probably make it either before we leave Kenhoro or shortly after we see my father in Shimashina.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NTA4MTdjYWU4ZjRmZjhiMGY0ZmU2YjgzZGE2YWJm">“Your father… he’s a Highlord, right?” Amelia asked, remembering the comment from Highlord Ru from earlier.</p>
<p class="cnMxZjU3OWU2MDdkMjQwZWVhMjcwMzY5MWE1MTQ3YzNj">“That’s right. Highlord Halen would be his title.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZWNjNzQ3ZmZlNDRhNmM4Zjc2MzUwZjVlNWM1ZmU1">“So, do you rule over…” Amelia spread her arms wide, “loads of territory of something?” Serena shook her head.</p>
<p class="cnM3MWY0OWIzOWVkYzQwODhiNDI0OTdhMzM5NjBmOTc4">“Not quite; remember how I told you Highlords can be put in charge of important areas, like a port or important industries? We have some estates sprinkled about, but it’s industry which made my father into a Highlord.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYzg4ZWYwMWE5MzQyMjM5MzdlNDRmNzY1NTQ4ZWVk">“Industry… what do you do?”</p>
<p class="cnNjYTE5YTM5MmViNDRhZjFhOTVlYTBjNGZmZDc3ZWQ5">“We, uh…” Serena looked at Amelia, a touch of worry in her eyes. “We make shells.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMThjMjk0ODMzYjQ0YWVhZDQyODZkOTgzMDZiYzI5">“Shells?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ODk2ZjY5N2EwYjQ0ODViMzEyMjkzMjNlMTFiMThm">“Munitions. Gun barrels. Explosives,” Serena clenched her jaw, “Weapons of war. This conflict has propelled House Halen’s wealth. It’s what made father a Highlord, and will soon likely be what confers me full Cascasdian Lordship.” Serena swallowed nervously. “Does that… bother you? It bothers many people…”</p>
<p class="cnM4NjcxZTliODc2ZjRhMDU4ZThiMWU5NmFmZTQ2OWM3">“I… don’t know,” Amelia said honestly. Did it bother her? “Maybe. I think so? But…” She added as Serena’s face fell. “Don’t think for a second this changes how I feel about you!” Amelia darted in, giving her another kiss on the cheek. “I don’t care what people say about you because I,” Amelia motioned to herself with a thumb, “I know what a beautiful, caring, and <em>easily flustered</em> demon you really are! I’m with you till the end!”</p>
<p class="cnNmNjg1NWE0Y2EyYjRmNmNhNjUyNzk4NDI2MjUxNDA1">“... Thank you. That was something that I was worried about. It means a lot… for you to say that.” Serena ruffled her golden hair a bit, the demon’s face returning to that familiar sly smile.</p><span class="cmNkNGM2MzdhNTcwYjQwOGNhNTdlYjljYzg4MzRkYjE5"><br/>Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjY2I3NDI3ZDlhMzRhOWI4YTNjMTlkZjcyYTQyMWRm">“Not a problem! So… what should we do now? I don’t want to be cooped up all day! Is there a washroom here?” Amelia examined the room and found there was a sliding door that revealed a modest room that looked like a washroom. There was a bamboo tub and an array of bamboo tubes that poked out the walls. At first look, it was very confusing.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDVmN2U4MGZjYTRlYWQ5MWViZDk3NTI0ZTBjY2Zj">“This is a traditional Manwese set-up. The bamboo is used to carry water from a stream or lake into the homes of the citizens. In this case I imagine there’s a water tank somewhere which is pumped full from a steam engine. Here,” Serena rotated a part of one of the bamboo pieces, and suddenly cold water came raining from the bamboo tube above the tub. The end of it had been carved to work like a shower head, sprinkling the water down. “This is for cold water, and this one is for hot water. You can adjust it as needed. Look, they have soap here, as well as skin scrubs.” Serena started opening a few cabinets and chests. “Here’s the towels.”</p>
<p class="cnNkODQzZDRjZjJlYTQ2MDNiOGRiMThhNjIyMTExMzRl">Ah! It was all so <em>old fashioned</em> but also so practical and cool! Amelia flashed Serena a grin. “I’m so happy!” She exclaimed. Serena looked at her with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTAxMzcxNWViZjQ2OTBiNTUxOWZhNDEyMTdjMjgz">“Over some towels?”</p>
<p class="cnNhYjk4YjQyN2UxZjQ3MmZhNmZiNjQ0Y2Q0NDE0MzQx">“No, all of this!” Amelia gestured to the room. “It’s so… cultured! All I remember is washrooms of bland ceramic and chrome metal. This is like being on holiday! I’m just so happy I get to experience this! And with you!”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDMxMmEwNTM5YjQzNDE4ZWNkNjBkOTFlOGFjODQz">“Don’t push your luck,” Serena said with a smile, “I’m not getting in with you, not yet.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYTNmYzM4OTllYzRlZTFhNmU0OWEzZmUwMWI3OGI1">“I meant experiencing everything, the whole world, with you!”</p>
<p class="cnNmOGE5MGQ3NWQ4ZjRiNzRiNjA2N2NjNTBiNDY1Y2Y4">“I know what you meant, idiot.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjIxODY4OTNiMzRmNTk4YWRiNmQ5NWE1YWE4NGMy">Serena turned, showing Amelia something on the door. “This is the latch, it works like this, see? Although I’m not going to be barging in on you, don’t you worry.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOWRiNjljNjZmMjQzM2ZiZWRlNmI2YzQ1NWY5Mjcw">“I wish you would,” Amelia said, not being able to resist sticking her tongue out.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTk0ODU4MzUyNTQ2NzdiOWM4MTU1ZWJlZDIxZDkw">“Idiot. Anyway, I’m going to the reception. I need to send a message to Tomes, to update him on everything. I think this inn should be able to provide me with a change of clothes. I need to get out of this captain's uniform. If someone comes in, then throw the soap at them or something, I imagine you can throw hard enough to put a hole in someone,” an amused smile crept up Serena’s face, “Then we can go get something to eat, although I don’t feel that hungry…”</p>
<p class="cnNmNGU0MzYwNzJjOTQ3OTY5MDEyMzU4YTdhNTIxZDVj">“That’s <em>Aseco’s</em> healing. It helps stave off hunger. But I think it’s still good to eat when you can!”</p>
<p class="cnNmYmQzM2Y4Zjc5YjQ5MWRiZTgwZjFkMjYxYmE2YTJi">“Alright,” Serena nodded. “I’ll introduce you to some local cuisine. I’ll get us some menus and make sure their kitchen is still open.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNGNkZjc0ZDM0YTQxOTFiNTFiMWUzZDcxNjAzZjhi">“Okay, thanks!” Amelia started unbuttoning her top, and as she began removing the articles of clothing, she saw Serena still hadn’t left and was watching her silently. “You want to stay, after all?” Amelia said, giving Serena a twirl.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDQwYzBlNDQ2ZTRmOWM4ZjE2YTdhOGYzZTI0Njcy">“Empress, save me from this crazy human…” Serena muttered, before taking one final look and leaving the washroom, shutting the door behind her. Amelia heard her mutter to herself to focus before hearing her open the main door and head towards reception.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDhiNTQyYzE4ZjQ3NDg5Zjk0ODhiMTVhYWMxMzYz">“Serena Halen, <em>my girlfriend</em>!” Amelia said to herself as she finished undressing. Every time she said those words her heart leapt with joy. “My girlfriend. My girlfriend. Ahhhh!” She brought both hands to her cheeks, wobbling on the spot in barely contained ecstasy.</p>
<p class="cnMxNTg5ZDBjNjY0OTQ3Yjk5NWM3YWVlM2E5YzQ0NGMx">It took her a while to find the right balance of hot and cold water that felt perfect. Her resistances were strong enough that she could probably handle swimming in magma, or being frozen in ice, but that didn’t stop the existence of the perfect ratio of cold and hot water for a shower.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjY0YzBiMjBiODQ4ZjRiNzE1ZTA2YzhmMjk1Zjll">After she was satisfied with the water, she climbed in and let the water fall on her head. Her first shower since coming to this world! The washroom in the captain’s quarters was only a tub with a towel to help wipe down the body. But this was a proper shower! Amelia moaned in satisfaction at the experience.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGIyZDA3NGVlOTQ1Y2Q4ZmI1ZTY4ZGI0MjRjNDdj">She examined the soaps one after another. They were all smells completely new to her although some of them smelled suspiciously similiar to lavender. She had seen a documentary once on artificial smells, which explained that every combination of smells identifiable to the human nose had been discovered and replicated synthetically. It turned out all perfume companies did was rotate existing smells, changing them slightly and giving them new names!</p>
<p class="cnM5NjQ2MzNmY2E1ODRiNjdiZWM4NTU5OGRkMTZmODQ5">It did explain why so many of these fragrances smelled familiar. Did lavender exist in this world? Amelia had seen something in the market that looked exactly like apples, and there were also fruits that looked similiar to pineapples. Anathor had once made a comment to her about human colonists arriving in this world thousands of years ago. She was certain her world was the origin of humanity, but had her ancestors somehow found a way to move to other worlds through magical means?</p>
<p class="cnM3N2U1ZTA0NTRkOTRmYzhhODdmNTdjNzY1ZjQ4ZWEw">Consumed in her thoughts, Amelia washed her body and soon she heard the familiar footsteps of Serena returning. She stopped the flow of water and dried herself with a towel. Slipping back into her clothes, Amelia spent an awkward amount of time trying to tighten it just like the tailor did. Satisfied, she found a comb and began coming through her hair as she stepped back into the bedroom.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTM4ZjcxNDE3MTRhOTBhN2ZjNDg3MDkxMzVlMTdh">Serena was sitting on a chair with a bundle of clothes and a pair of menus. “I forgot you can’t read Imperial yet, so I got two,” she said, standing up. “I’ll wash and change, and then we’ll head down. Mister Weng seems intent on providing us the best spot in the inn to eat..”</p>
<p class="cnM2NjFhMjE4NGQxNjQ3YWU5NzY3MjRkZjU3MDI5ODZm">“Okay!” Amelia sat down, combing through her hair more furiously. “I wish I had a spell to unknot hair, but I don’t think there is one!”</p>
<p class="cnNiYjMyYjA1NjEyNTRlMTZhMDRjMGNlZTVmOTU3ZmNh">“Ah, knots in the hair, finally something too powerful to be defeated by you,” Serena said, smirking. She gathered her clothes and strode into the washroom. “Seven hells, it smells nice in here. How much soap did you use?”</p>
<p class="cnM3Zjc1YTIzNzU1ZDQwZmRiMWNiOTE5NzU2ZjdiZGI3">“All of them! They smelled <em>so good</em>!”</p>
<p class="cnM4OWZiMWUzNzM3YjRlM2U5ODNkZTQxMzk2MTQyZmM4">“Hope they don’t charge us for burning through their stockpiles…” Serena closed the door and a moment later the noise of the shower could be heard. Amelia busied herself with her hair while trying her very hardest not to imagine the scene beyond the door. What would Serena do if she barged in?</p>
<p class="cnM1ZGE1MzAwNzgxNzQwYWY5OWQ4NGY0ZWMwYjFkZGVl">Best not to risk it, not yet anyway. She’d already won so many victories lately. She shouldn’t push her luck too far. A few minutes later and as Amelia finally coaxed the last knot out of her hair and wrapped it into a ponytail, Serena emerged wearing a smart set of pants and shirt. She looked like a businesswoman going about her day from one meeting to the next. Amelia wasn’t sure if she preferred this or the military uniform.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTQ1N2JhYTFmMjRhMmI4ZTMxYjQ1YjAyZWFmOTE0">“Ready?” Serena asked, slipping her shoes on.</p>
<p class="cnM5MzJmODU0MjEwNjQ3MDI4ZjE3MjY2OWI3ZWY4YzRl">“Yup!”</p>
<p class="cnNiMjA5Y2JhNWU0MDQxNjBhMGM5OGZmYWU0Nzk5MjBj">They left their room and Serena guided them downstairs to a large open area where several guests were eating. Mister Weng greeted them with a smile and led them to a raised section draped in a light cloth that allowed them to easily see outside but would give them privacy inside. On the table was a clear bottle with a light blue liquid inside, alongside a bucket of ice and a pair of highball glasses.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2E2YmRjM2M0ODRhZWZhM2FkZWI0M2QwYzQ5ZTM4">“Please, it’s on the house.” Mister Weng bowed. “Ring the bell when you’re ready to make your order. Speaker Halen, Speaker Thornheart. Once again, it’s a pleasure to have you reside with us.” The owner backed away and they were left alone. Amelia examined the bottle of blue liquid.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjRmNDhhZjk5MjQ5Yjk5OTdlYjVkYjgxZmZkNDZi">“What’s this, wine?” she asked.</p>
<p class="cnM3YWFlMmE4ZTE4MTQxNjNiNjJlMDZmNGMxYTgxMTIy">“Something much better,” Serena said, taking the bottle and wriggling the cork free. “This is <em>loqua</em>. The best drink in all of demon and humankind. It comes from loqua berries and can be drunk as either a juice or an alcoholic beverage. The latter being the most popular, of course.” Serena placed a few cubes of ice in both of the glasses and poured the loqua into them. “It comes in three main varieties. Blue, red and green. The colour comes from the type of moon crystal used in their production. That method is, of course, a secret.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTIwNmRjMTc2NDQwYWI5ZDFiMGZiNDFkNTY0Zjk3">Serena brought her glass to her nose and a satisfied smile erupted on her face. “There is yellow loqua, made from the yellow moon crystals from the moon that lingers only over Centralis, but that’s a royal drink and even Lords only drink it during official events.” She took a sip and a small groan of satisfaction came from the demon. “Blue is considered best when drunk cold, but some prefer it room temperature. Red is best hot, and green goes either way.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOTZhNDNmMjQ3YzQ1Y2M5OWJmM2E2ZDJlNTkwMTUw">Amelia took her own sip, and the richness of the flavour filled her mouth. When she swallowed the taste lingered and transformed into a satisfying aftertaste that just encouraged her to take another sip. “Is it worth a lot?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZWUzMmFlOTMzODQ4NmE5MDBhM2VkOGMxZjBmNjU0">“Yes, for the common worker. This bottle is…” Serena glanced at the menu. “Ten denarii. More than a month's salary for a soldier.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NzdjMDAxMTRkMDRhOGQ5MjZiZTVhMmVjYTMyMjVh">“So much!”</p>
<p class="cnNkMjNiN2QxZGM5ZDQwOTBiNTlmNDIzNTJlNWQ0OGQ5">“Of course, it’s manufactured in the Western Terra Firma and shipped all the way here. It’s the main export of the far West; the loqua berries will only grow under the light of the green moon.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NWU1NWE4ZjQ4NjQwODE5OWZlZDRmMzBjM2QxNmIw">“Are the moons always in the same spot? Don’t they orbit the planet?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ODkzNTNlZWQ3NzQ4YWViZDFlNmM4ZjMyMjcwNTdh">“No, the moons are magical in nature. They follow a cyclical pattern, moving closer to the land where they rain down moon crystals before pulling back high in the sky. They deviate a little, but the movements can be predicted mathematically. There is a non-magical moon that orbits the world at a greater distance, I’ll point it out to you when we see it.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZDEyNGY5ZDc2ODRkYzRhZmQyNjdjNjJmNDE3YmE0">“And the upcoming festival, you said that it was to do with the moons?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTJkZjAwZDdhZTQ4ZDFiY2MzNDhiYTA2YmU0NzNk">“Right,” Serena said, emptying her glass and refilling it. “At this time in the cycle, the moon is at its <em>apogee</em>. The furthest away from the planet it can go. The festival is an act of celebration and worship, to make sure it remembers to come back again.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYTZlNDVmZWM1NjQ5ZTc5NzJmNWExNWE4ZDVkNTVk">“Is it dangerous when the moon crystals fall?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMmU5NjAzZWE1NjQzM2RhOTM5MTc4NzFlYjI1YzQ0">“Yes, but not terribly so. The crystals react with the lumina as they fall so they sort of float down. Some of the crystals have more rocks embedded in them so they don’t slow down as much. Normally everyone stays indoors for the period of moonrain when it comes.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZWM4ZWRhNmVkYTQ4ZWNiNDZiYzA0NTY3NDcwOGQy">Amelia finished her glass of loqua and poured another one. The bottle was almost half empty already! She would definitely be ordering some more. After all, she could afford it.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGM5NTQyZDU4YzQ3ODdiZDhkMzI2NGQ1YmI2NjNm">“So the blue moon is here, red is in the south, yellow is Centralis and green is in the west. What’s in the north? What about the human territories?”</p>
<p class="cnNlOGVlNmMwNzdiYTRiMjBhNmZjMzU4Y2U4NDY4YWU2">“The north is covered by the cold light of the purple moon. Most of Cascadia is warm or tropical, but the north is frigid and cold. Something about the cold makes purple loqua impossible to manufacture, which is why that colour of drink doesn’t exist. As for the human territories, the Federation has an orange moon. Karligard and the Republic share a white one, and there’s one more… I can’t remember.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMTg1OWU3YzQ1ZjQwOGQ5YmZkZWUwMDI4N2I5OWQx">“Is there a black moon?” Amelia asked. If there was a white one, surely there was a black one.</p>
<p class="cnM3MmM0ZTE2MzA0OTRiZGY4ZjI2NGI0Nzc1MmRmZjhj">“No,” Serena said, shaking her head. “No black one.” Those crimson eyes looked at her for a while.</p>
<p class="cnNiNDU3NjU0MWI2NTRmMzU4NjQ2YWU4YTUzZjE1NjJj">“What?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnNlMWY3YTcxZmYwMzQ3NTViYmNhZjFkZTU3YmViYjk5">“The next moonrain in the east will take place while we’re in Shimashina, but the morning after a moonrain, when the blue moon is at its closest…” Serena cast her arms about, imitating a sweeping landscape. “It’s beautiful. The forest is cloaked in a blanket of blue light, and it sparkles! From thousands of freshly fallen crystals. You only have an hour or so to enjoy it before the harvesters get their grubby hands on it all. Even so…” Serena looked to the side awkwardly, “I would like to see the next one with you, if you’d like.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYTA2NmRkODU4YTRjNmNhMTA1Nzk2YWY1Zjk2NGQ4">“I’d love that!” Amelia grinned. Already another date was planned! This couldn’t be going any better!</p>
<p class="cnNkNzRiN2RiZWQxNjQyNmM5OTcxMDcxZDU3NzA1NWY5">“Good… good. It’ll be a sight to remember,” Serena said before ringing the bell on the table. “Let’s order, I know the perfect thing to get.” A moment later an employee appeared, Serena gave them the order, including a request for a bottle each of blue and green loqua.</p>
<p class="cnM4MGY5OGZlOTc3NjQ2YjY5M2Q5ZmUwMzdhNGVhZjI0">“Why not red?” Amelia asked once the employee had withdrawn.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTM3YjEwMzVhMjQ2N2JiNjU0ZDgzMDU3ZmExYjMz">“Red crystal is in shortage at the moment, due to the war.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMmIxYzQ1ZjYzZTRmYTg4MzMwNGYxYzM5MTg2MzQ0">“What has the war got to do with it?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNDA3MTdlNDg2ODRmYjJiMGIxYWQ4ZWNhMGZiODdi">“It’s a key component in the manufacture of explosives,” Serena said with a shrug. “It’s very expensive these days due to demand and export controls. It’s why it was so expensive when you ordered the mask.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYTU3NGE2NTkzYzQwNDViNmExMzAyNjQ2ZWI0Mzc0">“The mask!” Amelia’s eyes widened, remembering the bag she had left behind in the Highguard. She had completely forgotten! “I left the gift bag behind in Lord Yulan’s room!”</p>
<p class="cnMwZThhNmFmMjYzMTQ5MGZiNzJmNTE0MWQ2YWYwYzE3">“Not to worry, I’ll send a message to Lord Yulan in the morning. I’m sure we can get it back.” Serena shrugged. “And if not, I’ll buy you another one.” Oh my, what a reliable and pragmatic girlfriend she had found!</p>
<p class="cnNhN2ZlMzcwZmI5MjRiZWI4NDZhNDcwNTI0MGI2YmU5">“Okay!” Amelia said cheerfully. The cloth curtain opened and the employee brought two bottles of loqua, one blue and one green to the table. After verifying there wasn’t anything else he could do for them he withdrew with a bow.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjI4OGU2MDBmZjQyM2Y4MGUwMTkxMGZmMjcxNjNh">“Green loqua,” Serena said as she poured two glasses, “Is sweeter than blue. It’s also higher in alcoholic content so be careful. Although, as a Speaker it’s pretty hard to get drunk.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OWI5MDA0NGJjNzRjOTA4ZDNlNTE2OGRjZTU2MDI0">Amelia took a sip, noting the sweetness of the green liquid. Like blue, it was delicious and left a collection of flavours in her mouth that changed as time went on. Serena wasn’t wrong, it was much stronger than the blue loqua. She felt the fumes of the alcohol go to her head. She wouldn’t be a lightweight right? Not in this body?</p>
<p class="cnNiZjE1OTI5ZWZiYzQ1OGY4MTc5MTU5MzljYzYzNDk1">They spent a few minutes drinking quietly, chatting about random topics. Amelia found out about Serena’s younger sisters. One of them was called Nina, and was some genius engineer working in Centralis, and the other was the youngest called Lani, who was still in school and in Serena’s words was a <em>teenage brat</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2UwZmIwNmQwYjQxMmFhODE5M2FmMjExOGU1NjU4">Then the food came and a dozen small bowls were placed in front of them. They were each provided with a larger empty bowl, as well as several pairs of chopsticks. After the employees had left Amelia raised an eyebrow at Serena.</p>
<p class="cnNhY2E4YmQ1NTQwNjRlMzQ4NzIzMjlkNzE1MWVhYzI4">“How the hell do I eat this?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnM2YmQyZjAyMWRjMzQ4ZTk5MzQ2YTRlN2NkOTk4Nzgy">Serena laughed, her cheeks flushed with alcohol. “Here, place the large bowl in front of you. Now, sit up straight and maintain good posture. Don’t let your back touch the wall or seat behind you. Okay, now take the chopsticks, like this… no like this…” Eventually, Amelia was able to mimic Serena's holding of the chopsticks.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmE4ZDIxMTNkYzRlNzVhYzMxNGZhNTMyNTZmMDky">“So, this is a traditional Manwese set-up. You see how all the meats and vegetables are a similar size?” Serena said, pointing to the many bowls sprinkled around the table. “The goal is you take a rice patty like this,” Serena lifted the thin circular piece of rice before placing it neatly in the centre of the large bowl. “And then you build your mouthful. Typically you want one vegetable and one meat.” Serena demonstrated neatly. “And then, if you haven’t put too much, you can close it easily with the chopsticks like so.” With a flourish of her wrist, Serena wrapped the meat and vegetable in the rice covering before picking the entire thing up and placing it in her mouth.</p>
<p class="cnNlYWMzZGY3ODJiZTRmYjk5OWJjZDYxZjFhMDhjYWRl">She made it look so easy.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWJmNTk1ZTMzYTQ3MmU4MzIxNDQwNWRmOTY1MWNm">“There’s a concept in the East,” Serena said, “About knowing yourself. Part of that is knowing how much you can fit in your mouth, and it is about controlling gluttony.” She laughed, watching Amelia’s attempts at folding the rice around the meat that kept falling out. “See it as your first test of etiquette, okay?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YjcwMDliZDQwYjRhMWI4MjhlZWY4MWJlMWRhY2Q3">“You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?” Amelia muttered, stabbing the meat with her chopstick and biting it like a kebab. When the taste filled her mouth her eyes widened! She hurriedly swallowed. “This is chicken!” she exclaimed happily.</p>
<p class="cnNjM2IzMjVmNDVkODQ5NjE5MjVlM2M2MTY4NDBhNWYz">“No, it’s <em>choco</em>. Anathor said choco is a descendant species of chickens, which went extinct long ago. It’s mostly popular in Centralis and the north. I had to request they made this especially for us.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMjVhOGRkNWYwMDQxYmE4ZWZjODRhMzhhNmVhYjIx">“It tastes exactly the same! Well,” Amelia took another bite of the choco. “I think it does, at least!” The meat was tender and perfectly cooked. Despite not being hungry, she couldn’t resist another bite.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGVkOWUwNjNlMzQ1ZWZiODFiNTI0MzlhMTQ1MjMx">“Stop stabbing the food, try again. Rice patty first. Follow me,” Serena said, guiding Amelia through the process of constructing her little wrap. This time she was able to build something that survived the trip into her mouth.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDViOWI1ZmIyNjQ5NDBiMDRkMDU3MGVmZTAzMGU1">“It’s good!” Amelia said after she had swallowed. “I’m getting used to the chopsticks!” She took another drink of green loqua, the flavour pairing well with the choco meat.</p>
<p class="cnM2NGFjZjM3YjcwZDRkOWRhOTE5MTFjNjgwYjkxMTUx">“I’m glad you enjoy it. It’s not as good as sardis, but we have other fish here to try. Look at this,” Serena guided Amelia through another recommendation and as the minutes ticked by the two of them were busy with trying out different combinations and drinking through both bottles of loqua.</p>
<p class="cnM2NTU5ZmNiZmFjMzQyODg4NzM4NTgxZDY5NWU4MzFk">Seeing they were empty of both food and drink, Amelia took the initiative and rang the tablebell. When the employee appeared, she ordered another bottle of blue and green loqua. Once the employees had removed the empty bottles and bowls, Serena cast a sly smile at her.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTdjM2IyZGMwNzQyNTJiZGZkNDk2ZGZlY2Q0MjIx">“Trying to get me drunk, are you?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MzUyNzU3ZDU0NjQ1ODZiNzkxYTk0ZWYyYzUyOWVj">“Obviously,” Amelia threw back. “But I’m also interested in how much I can drink. I used to be such a lightweight but now I feel I can handle so much more.” She clenched her hands together, feeling more tipsy than she was letting on. By her estimates, the blue loqua was similar to a strong wine, and the green was equivalent to a strong spirit. If so, in her old world she would have long passed out. Now? Now she felt <em>good</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNlMmE1NmI5NDFjNDQ0N2FhMDE2YTM2NGNiZjgyM2Ey">The bottles came and the two wasted no time in opening them. Serena shared stories from the academy that made Amelia giggle and, on more than one occasion, splutter loqua onto the table. Amelia spent a long time trying to explain to Serena how in her world they had - without the aid of magic - travelled to their moon and constructed a flourishing base on it.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWJkYWNkOGI2MDQyNTNiN2ZjZjVjZDA3OGVkMDRl">Soon those two bottles were empty, and Amelia could no longer deny she was close to being drunk. She was sure she could heal the feeling away, but she didn’t want to. When she had drunk this much, it was so easy to stare lovingly into Serena’s eyes, who returned the look with no hesitation. At some point they even started holding hands, only remembering to separate when the employee came to take the bottles away.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTViMDI3NmM1MTRmN2Q4YTM0NWEwYmJlMzZmNzIw">They both looked at the empty bottles longingly before turning to look at each other.</p>
<p class="cnMyNzFlYTQ3ODUzNzQxZDNiZTI3MGZmMGMyZjMxZTZh">“One more bottle, before bed?” Amelia asked, trying not to tip over.</p>
<p class="cnMxMGVmODdiY2M3MjQ4ZDc4NmZjMDk0ODNjNTlkMDEx">“One more bottle,” Serena affirmed, gesturing to the employee. “Green, please.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMWEyMDNhZDIzMzRhZjNhZWFkMWY4YTJmYWQ5MTNh">After all, one more bottle couldn’t hurt, could it?</p>

      <description>Chapter Twenty-One: The Kenhoro Officer Academy</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMxYjMwNWQwODRlOTRjMmJhN2RlYjk1MTM0Yzk5ZTEw"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNlNWM0NDAzMjJjZTRmNjc4NGQyYjVjYjVlODYzZDFi">“You’re here,” grumbled the grizzled captain as Serena once again found herself standing in an ethereal fog that stretched endlessly into the darkness. “You’ve committed a cardinal sin,” the captain said, his voice muffled in the unnatural expanse. “There will be a punishment.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNThlMjc4ZTZjMDQ4ZTY4NTMwODFhNTQ3MDU0ZjJm">Serena’s thoughts were full of Amelia, and she felt anger rise within her. Was she still drunk? She was probably still drunk. “For falling for a woman? A human?” She snapped at the illusive man, who didn’t react at all to her outburst.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjY1MzUzMWM1ZjQ3YWI4YWQwZjQ3OWJkZWRmYmZh">“Too late… you must protect the girl…” the captain grumbled, removing his captain’s hat to reveal messy grey hair and the edges of an aged face. Serena paused, realising this dream figure was <em>human</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNkMmQxMmNjMjU2ODRiY2ZiM2Q4YjIzMTkwZTRjZTY0">“I’m heading to the ice-lands to do my part. As for you…” The human battered the side of his hat, knocking dirt and dust loose. The rhythmic beating of his palm against the brown leather sent shockwaves throughout the space. “... the pair of you must go to the desert. The old temple…”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZWU0NmE4OWU3YzRiYTliZGU4ZTRiYzEzYzNhNTYz">“Why!? What if I refuse?” She challenged the old captain’s ramblings.</p>
<p class="cnNiY2MwODgyNmU1YTQxNTI4M2E0NjAxYjQyMWFlODkz">“I wish there were another way, but you must. To keep her safe…” The captain turned into white mist and vanished, leaving only the frothing fog that covered Serena’s vision and wrenched her into the waking world.</p>
<p class="cnMyNzY4NDgwZWFhZTRiMDViMjY2YTNjNGY2ODk3ZGUz">As she became conscious, she peeled open one eye before closing it in pain. What a terrible hangover! What a thoroughly idiotic demon she was to drink so much! She tried to remember how much she’d drank, but just imagining more alcohol made her feel queasy. Serena groaned before forcing herself back to unconsciousness where hopefully the next time she woke her head wouldn’t be throbbing like it was.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjc4OWYxMjgzMTRjMjRhMTJiN2VlZDY1ODYwZWNm">When she once again stirred awake, she realised there was something warm and soft wrapped in her arms. This felt a lot nicer than her own head and if she focused on it, it helped distract herself from her hangover. She squeezed the thing in her arms, and it made a squeak.</p>
<p class="cnMzYTYwMDY5YzhiYzQ0MGJhYzlkNzU4ZTNlYjBiZGFh">How amusing.</p>
<p class="cnMyODRhMmE1OTZhNjQxMDU5N2UyNDM1ZGM1NmI4MTFi">She squeezed it again and it made another cute noise. Serena felt a warm hand hold hers.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWI2MmZkZjg4YjQ0NmE5NjQyMjBlYThmYTMxMzU5">“Mmm… morning,” Amelia whispered.</p>
<p class="cnNjOTY1MzE1Nzg4MDRmNTdhYmE5N2Y0MDllZGQzN2Mz">“Hungover,” muttered Serena, not liking the aftertaste in her mouth. “Heal me, please… before I throw up.” She didn’t have to ask twice, and soon magical warmth rippled through her body, wiping away the awful pressure in her head. She no longer felt parched or tired. The general ache throughout her body vanished, and Serena felt like she could run a hundred klicks.</p>
<p class="cnNiZmI5ODIyYWQzZDRiMzViNDg2OTY5NDY1MmYzOGEw">“Your magic is truly wonderful,” Serena said, blinking her eyes open. Now she saw why Amelia felt so warm. Both their upper bodies were devoid of all clothing, and Serena was wrapped around the girl. Serena snapped her eyes down, breathing a sigh of relief when she saw they still had their trousers on.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDZkN2Y4MDU2ZTQ3ODM5YmU0Njk2MDhiMmU3NGNh">What had happened? With her head no longer splitting, she could cast her mind back to the night before. She started counting the bottles of loqua they had drunk. Two… four… six… seven hells, how much had they spent!? The pair of them had gotten one last bottle and then stumbled back to their room, only just keeping up appearances until the door was shut behind them, after which they had thrown themselves at each other in drunken passion.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2JlMjQzOGZhMDQ2YzA5M2IzYWRmY2MwYjM0MjQw">Kissing. There was a lot of kissing.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzgwMmI4MmU0MDQ4ZGQ5ZWE1NmQwYzdjYzgzM2Jh">When had the clothes come off?</p>
<p class="cnNiN2QwMjJlNzY4MzQyZDdhZGQyNWNmZjBiZjNlZGQz">Serena couldn’t quite remember. She propped herself up on one arm and ran a hand over Amelia’s stomach. “How are you doing?” She asked, surprising herself at how smooth she sounded. With a bitter realisation she noticed she felt pride at the events that had transpired. There was something so validating about having someone throw themselves at her with passion and desire.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDI1MzAyMGY2OTQ1YzE5ZjlmZjdhNzVhNTE4Y2Ux">To make things even more satisfying, this wasn’t just a fling, it was <em>Amelia</em>. It was her <em>girlfriend</em>. Serena internally cringed at the next thought but couldn’t deny it was a part of how she felt about the situation.</p>
<p class="cnMwNGI1NDNmZDNiMjQ4NDZiMTViMjIwOGVjYTA4OGNi">Her <em>conquest</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjNiNmJlODMwMTQzNGI5YjYyYjZkOGYzMzlhNWNl">“Mmm…” groaned Amelia, rolling onto her back, her left arm covering her eyes and her right was under the blanket, placed ontop of Serena’s. “I smell of alcohol…” she mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDRhNmRmNjJiOTQxOTJiOWE1MTdhNGVmZmYwZWFi">“So do I,” Serena said, turning her head and smelling herself. “When you drink so much, you sweat it out when you sleep. We’ll probably have to get new sheets and wash up…”</p>
<p class="cnM4OGRiZjA3OWJkZDQyMGQ5Y2I0OTQxNzcxNTQ5Nzg5">“Uh, no need. Here,” Amelia said before casting a spell Serena had seen the day before. It was Amelia’s cleaning spell. Immediately, Serena felt <em>clean</em> as every iota of dried sweat, dirt, and alcohol was magically cleansed from her body. She ran her tongue around inside her mouth and found the spell also cleaned her teeth. She no longer felt the urge to go to the toilet.</p>
<p class="cnM2OTEwNmM4ZjFmMzQzYTc5YjcwYmNjNzhmNWM1MGY1">“That’s… ridiculously helpful. With that and your healing, would you ever need to eat, sleep, or change clothes?” She asked as the utility of such a powerful cleaning spell popped up in her mind. The normal cleaning spells she knew about were more of an assistance towards normal cleaning rather than a complete replacement.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWEyYTg3MTg0MDQwNjg4NGY3MmExNmZlMzNjMTBj">“Maybe… even so, I want to keep eating delicious things, sleep in comfy beds, and try out pretty dresses,” Amelia said, her voice sounding more wakeful. “Also, look what you did!” Before Serena could say anything, Amelia threw the blanket down, exposing her naked chest and…</p>
<p class="cnNiZmJkNTA5MTBmNDQzYWNiMmY3NzI5MWExM2Q2Yzkz">The teeth marks that had bruised one of her breasts.</p>
<p class="cnMxMWE5YTEyMDRhNjQ2NTI4YjVkODUxNTI2MWQ4Mzg0">Oops. Serena felt herself swallow nervously. Was that her? It must have been her, right?</p>
<p class="cnM3YTAxNWQ1MWE1MjRmOGNiMmY2N2RmMTI4YzRlMGUz">“Was that me?” She asked, cupping Amelia’s breast and lightly rubbing it.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGNjMGVlYjhlZTQzOTBiY2JjNzFkMmNmMmNkYWQw">“Yes, it was you,” Amelia said with a sigh, but the corners of her mouth teased upwards as she removed her arm and made eye contact with Serena. “The tongue was nice, but you were too tipsy to control your teeth, stupid demon.” Amelia put both hands behind her head and gave Serena a sly grin. “Are you enjoying groping me? I won’t lie; it’s kind of relaxing.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOGVhMWEyY2FiZDRmMjJiNjVmZjM1N2Y1N2U3NDI4">“Ah, sorry,” Serena said, removing her hand as a small amount of golden light with blue flecks healed the bruise away. That was a shame, she was going to ask if she could kiss it better. Before she could do anything else, Amelia turned to her front and exposed her back.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzE5NWQ0N2JiZDRmYTNiZTVhOWZkZTdjNzFmNjFl">“Make it up to me,” she said.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDdlZGVjOWUyMTQ5YWE5ZjQxMzNkZWNjNTY1Mzky">“How?”</p>
<p class="cnNlYjk0YzQ4MjQ3NjQ5OGM4NzhkOTk0YWIxNmIyYTg2">“Give me a massage,” Amelia said, her voice muffled by the pillow. “Not too firm but not too soft.” Serena obliged, running her hands up and down Amelia’s back. The human wasn’t muscular, but she was slim enough Serena could identify the different muscle groups and begin to massage them with varying levels of pressure while making adjustments based upon the cute noises coming from Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnMwNGRmZmNjZjA2MjQ4OTZhNTJlYWYwZDc1NzU1NTIw">“Mmm…”</p>
<p class="cnM4MDYzNDkzNDM5MjQ3N2FiZmU2ZjZmNzVkNjdmZjFk">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="cnMwN2JmZmM2NWMyNzQ4OTk5MzM0MjJjNmU1MTFlOWQw">“Right there…”</p>
<p class="cnMyMmQyNDQ5ZTk2YzRjYzI4MGJjMDA0MGNlMDQwNmJj">“Ahhh!”</p>
<p class="cnNmNTJlOTIzOWY2YjRiMjhhYWE5OWQ5MWYwZjM1OGJm">The last was squeaked out while Amelia violently wriggled underneath her. It turned out that Amelia’s sides were ticklish. How adorable! Serena filed that bit of knowledge away for future use before apologising and resuming the massage in a more acceptable way.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzEwZWIyZDgzMDRmZmQ5NDYwMmE3YjY0ZTM4ZmRj">Five then ten minutes passed, and Amelia’s breathing became slow and soft. Another five minutes and Serena was sure she had just massaged her girlfriend back to sleep. That was a good thing, right? She leaned in and gave her a soft kiss on the base of her neck.</p>
<p class="cnMxMWQ4NzcyNDI3NTQ0NWJhYzE1Njc4YzVkOWZhMzY0">“I’m going to wash up,” she whispered before carefully clambering off the bed and heading to the washroom. With Amelia’s magic she didn’t need to clean herself, but that still didn’t stop the satisfaction of a hot shower and the smell of the fancy soaps the inn had provided them.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjMyNTZiYWE4YTQxYTJhMzczNzhmZGIwMzk5NGJj">As the hot water rained down on her back, and the room steamed up, Serena ran the events of the night over and over again in her head. Things they had spoken about, the stories and jokes they had both shared. The warmth of each other's bodies when they returned. On more than one occasion, Serena caught herself smiling happily to herself like an idiot.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjEyYTQ1ZDFiNzQ3MGZhZDVjYjNlMjA4NjFkNWNl"><em>You’ve become a rather smitten demon, haven’t you?</em> She thought to herself.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDM2ZmE3NDUwNjRmM2U5NWM0MTBjNjA1NWFjNTNj">Her thoughts then turned to her dream. She ran it over in her head again and again. Something was so <em>familiar</em> about that human captain. Had she seen him in a book somewhere? Perhaps during a lesson in the academy? Was he the embodiment of the ship itself reaching out to her or something else? She would have to bring it up again with Anathor. This wasn't something she could just ignore.</p>
<p class="cnM0NDlkNmJlMjY1OTQyMDNhNzE3YmZhMGMzN2IwYTJl">She finished up, drying and dressing herself before returning to the bedroom to find Amelia propped up on the side of the bed, hugging a towel that covered her chest.</p>
<p class="cnNiYmYzNTdjN2Q4OTQxMWI4OGRlYThlNjdmN2Y1NGU0">“Morning,” Amelia said with a smile. She hopped off the bed and passed Serena. “You smell good,” Amelia said, before opening the door, “You’ve made it so warm and steamy for me! Thank you!” The blond hair vanished through the doorway and not long after the sounds of a sweet melody could be heard.</p>
<p class="cnNkOGY1ZTZiY2FjMzRiNmRiMjg1NTQzNmVhZDQ3NDAz">Serena listened for a moment, appreciating the talents of her girlfriend before collecting herself. She had a few things she wanted to get done today. Serena tidied up the bedroom, before arranging some spare blankets and pillows into an impromptu futon. For now, she wanted to make it look like they hadn’t slept in the same bed. After she had finished redecorating, she pulled the cord to get the receptionist’s attention.</p>
<p class="cnNjYjhmNzZkMDk1OTQ1OTA4OWYwY2U5YmQyZmY0OTdh">A minute later, there was a polite knock on the door. “Reception,” a voice sounded from outside. Serena opened the door, making sure to swing it wide enough that the attendant would see the futon. She stepped outside, closing the door behind her.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTBjMzFiNzg2NzRhYmJiM2JhMDBjMDc2ZGZhNWI4">“We’d like some coffee for the room and something simple for breakfast. Does the kitchen have any soup prepared?” Even though Serena was fully healed, she still felt uncomfortable eating something too harsh on her stomach. It was probably a psychological thing, her mind was used to treating the stomach delicately after a night of heavy drinking.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDQ5MTA3OGJkYzQzNWFiYjY5ZDFhN2U1MDBjMDM3">“Ah, the cook has prepared a choco broth that should be ideal for hangovers. Would two portions be sufficient?”</p>
<p class="cnNkYTViNDM3MDFlNzQ5NGVhMDQ4NmM0ZmY5N2Y0OTMw">“Yes, and some bread and butter to go with it.”</p>
<p class="cnNlZDM5ODdjMjNlMzQ0NzhiYzg0YThmZDJhMzMwMmY0">“Of course. We’ve just had our morning delivery. We have some fine sourdough with a traditional honey glaze that would pair well.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MmU4MTAxZjlhOTQ5MzJiNDA1NDY3NjI1NGRmMzA0">“Good, and coffee?” Serena was wide awake without a glimmer of tiredness. Even so, if she could start the morning with a decent coffee she would.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWVhOGEzMDYzODQ5NTI4YTllNzFhMTQ1NDNkN2Fk">“We have beans from the mountains of Shiloh, and the fields of Yamen. We also have a brand of Dacian coffee, although many of our customers find it too harsh.”</p>
<p class="cnNlZmQ4YjBlZGE2MjQ1ZmZhYjNiOGMyYjQ3NzE1NWIz">“Nothing from Jimar?”</p>
<p class="cnMyOGU4MmUyNGI1ZDQxZmRiNTIxYWFiMGE4ZDgzZTZh">“I’m afraid we’ve run dry, Speaker Halen,” said the attendant, his voice sounding sympathetic, “The next delivery is scheduled for the weekend. We could find some on the market, if you’re willing to wait?”</p>
<p class="cnNiOWQzNjE4YWM3NTQxMDY5ZmI1NmFlYmM4NjMxZjUw">“No need, Shiloh is fine. Bring a pot and two cups. Some biscuits as well.” Serena much preferred the bitterness of Jimari coffee, especially for handling hangovers. This time however, she wasn’t actually hungover, so the smoothness of Shiloh coffee would be acceptable.</p>
<p class="cnNjODdlYjU2Y2EyZjQzNTU4NDRhNWYxNjE2YTNiZjI3">“Very well. I’ll return in fifteen minutes.” The attendant clasped his hands together and bowed before walking away.</p>
<p class="cnNkZmRlYjE0MmMxODRlMTk4OTBiYTM5ZTY1MmNlZDI3">Serena watched him go before returning to the room and relaxing on a chair. Amelia appeared from the steamy bathroom, combing her wet hair. “Help me with these tassel things,” Amelia said, turning her back to Serena, who stood up and helped tighten the clothing properly. “What’s that about?” Amelia said, gesturing to the impromptu futon.</p><span class="cmExZjY4ZTIyODdjNTQwN2ViNTc5YzBhZmRiNzY0OTcy"><br/>This story has been unlawfully obtained without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNiNTViMWUwN2E3NzQ5YWFhNjIzYzNhZTI2YWQ3MjYw">“Don’t want the attendants thinking we shared a bed, for now at least. It’s best to at least <em>try</em> and pretend we’re two Speaker friends.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MWQ1OGUzNWY2ZTQ2ZDg5N2YwZDIwNmEwMDVkNTk4">“Ah, sure,” Amelia said, a moment in silence passing before she spoke again, “Do you really think we can keep it a secret for long?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMjQxZTEzMzhlYzQxOTI5YzZlODc3NTc2MzRjZGNl">“Seven hells, no,” Serena finished helping dress Amelia and rotated the human to face her. “But it would help to warm them to the idea somewhat slowly. I figure people like Tomes will figure it out pretty quickly.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NDkxYzQzNTlhOTQ2YTE5OGZlMmY1OTMwYTA4YzU2">“Will the crew take it alright? It won’t cause any problems with the uh, ship command?”</p>
<p class="cnNiODM0NWUwNWQ0ZDRmNTJiYzVhYmUwMGYyNDNlNDk3">“No,” Serena shook her head. Her officers and crew were better than that. “Their loyalty is greater than any bias they may have. As long as I don’t try and sail off to join the Karligard Navy they won’t mention it much.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NzFkNzgwY2YzNDQyN2M5MTdhNDk2YjFhMGUyN2Q5">“But I’m not even from Karligard!” Amelia protested.</p>
<p class="cnNhOTVkMzBjOGVhNzRlODc5ZWRjNDk2YWI5YjY4NjRj">“Best you pretend to be. This morning I’ll take you over everything I know about the country, so you should somewhat be able to pass as coming from there. Although if you’re ever asked anything you don’t know but feel like you should, you can brush off your ignorance as a result of you spending most of your time travelling.”</p>
<p class="cnM5Nzk2MDBmZDQwMTQzNjdhNjcyZGY3NjlhMTg1MGRh">“Right, but won’t the Karligard authorities eventually look into it?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MzI2MzM3NGRmMDQ5MzFiMGU4MTRmNzY3Njc0MTEx">“By then, you’ll hopefully be a citizen of Cascadia and a sanctioned Speaker.”</p>
<p class="cnMwN2E4YmY5YTNjOTQwNDc5MjM3YWExNjEwZmM5NDcw">“Mmm, alright! So, what’s the plan for today?”</p>
<p class="cnMyMzAyOWY2MzIxMTRmZmFhNThiMWZiNTgxNjc3YWI4">“First, breakfast and coffee,” Serena began, and as if on cue a polite knock sounded at the door. Serena opened it to find the attendant with a tray of food and coffee. “Ah, thank you,” She said, taking it from him. She closed the door and set the tray on the table.</p>
<p class="cnM4NDlhMzNlMWZkZTQwODg4MmU5NTlkNTA5YjViODI4">“Is that <em>butter</em>!?” Amelia whispered excitedly.</p>
<p class="cnNjNWM2ODMxN2MzNTRjZGNiZGQ4Mzk5M2E3ZDBjYzA3">“Yes, now let’s eat.” They both sat at the table and Serena poured them both a cup of coffee from the pot. “These are beans from Shiloh. They’re considered far more smooth and less bitter than Jimari coffee. I think you might find it more pleasant.” Amelia took a sip, and Serena made a few adjustments to the human's posture and the way she was handling the cup.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDhlNDBkYzYxYTRiNzg4M2Q3ZWNkYmVjYWUyODE3">“Purse your lips and take a small sip; it’s important to be able to drink like this without making any slurping noises. At least, in polite company.” Serena demonstrated, and Amelia spent a moment copying her, eventually being able to drink the coffee without any noise.</p>
<p class="cnNhODRhMjBmYmZmZDQxOTc4NGNiNzU4ODE5ZDlmODI3">“Well, I feel like a proper noble lady now!” Amelia exclaimed. “What about the soup? Is there a fancy way to eat that I need to learn?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzRmMDdlN2ViYTQ0ZWE5N2NmMGM1ZDIyM2M0ZDU0">“Normally, soup wouldn’t be served to ladies in high society. If it ever is, it’s only consumed a spoonful at a time. Dipping bread and butter would be shocking to the stuck-up bitches you find around some tables.” Serena shrugged, buttering a piece of bread and dipping it into the choco soup. “Given we’re in private and meant to be hungover, we can be excused.” She bit into the bread, enjoying the flavours of the butter and choco melding together in her mouth.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTZjMGRiMzM5OTRjMjFiMzI5NmI0ZDIwNzBjNTQ4">Amelia copied her, and a very unnoble moan of happiness erupted from the human as she munched on the bread. “Oh my,” Amelia said between mouthfuls, “I’d forgotten how good butter is. Please tell me you also have cheese…”</p>
<p class="cnNiYTdhNWQ2ZDIxMTQ1Mzg4OWE1MWQ4MDU5NWRkOGIz">“Yes, but it’s not common in the East. You’ll find that it’s popular in Centralis and the North.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNWMwNDI3ZmIwNzQxNGRhZjI0MjZmOWRjMjkwYzY2">“Mmm…” murmured Amelia, and the both of them continued eating and sipping coffee. Serena did her best to give Amelia a rundown of Karligard. Its government, people and culture. She missed plenty of areas, but if Amelia tactfully slipped in a tidbit or a reference here or there, she could plausibly pass as a native who spent most of her time travelling. After a few minutes, the bowls and cups were empty, and they both sat back, satisfied.</p>
<p class="cnNkYTM0YWZhZDdkZTQ5ZTY4NmI4NTVjMjI3YjViNjQ3">“Right,” said Serena after taking a moment, “We’re going to the Kenhoro Officer Academy.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYzIyZTJmYzlhOTQyZjg5NjljNjFmNDQ1YWUyZjIz">“Why?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNDU4MmVmNzRiNzQyY2E5NmJhYjQyMGNmY2ExZDBm">“I need to speak to someone there, and we can make use of their private training rooms to give you another lesson. Time to have you swinging a wooden sword.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDY2NzQxNTBhZjRhZDNhMDRjNzllOTYxYWExYWI3">Amelia’s eyes sparkled. “Really!?” She beamed, “I get to swing an actual weapon!?” Serena snorted at that. It was strange seeing the human get so excited over swinging a sword when Amelia was herself a walking weapon.</p>
<p class="cnMwOWNhNjM5MDQzZjRlNTJhODEzZjM0Nzc5ZGIyMGNj">“Yes,” Serena replied, keeping her thoughts to herself. “We’ll go through your katas with the sword movements and introduce you to some basic three-step drills.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYWJiMDIzNTFkMDQwZjY4YzE5NmJmMjBhMmJmZjIz">“Is this the academy you graduated from?”</p>
<p class="cnNmODA4MzNiZTc4MjQxNjNhMTkwZThhNmQwMDM3ZTcz">“No,” Serena said, shaking her head, “But as a Speaker, I’m entitled to use its facilities how I wish. My academy was based in the Three Sisters.”</p>
<p class="cnM0M2NkZTFhOTQyNTQwZTRiMTlhNzk3YzFjZTBkMDVm">“Three Sisters?”</p>
<p class="cnNiM2Y3MjE0NGE1MDRkMGM4Yjk1ODBkOGFmOWE5NzI2">“The sister cities of Asamoto, Asamaywa and Asamino. They’re right next to each other and are so connected they are basically one huge city. I grew up in Asamino and entered the Asamaywa Flight Academy for my officer training.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNmQzZGNiZTFjNzQzOGRhNjI4N2U0MTk0MDdlMDU5">“Will we ever go there?” Amelia asked, her eyes brimming with hope.</p>
<p class="cnNlNWIzZGU1ZGRmZDQ1ZTNhYzFhMTY3NmRhMzJjMzE5">“Of course,” Serena said, nodding. “It’s where the main family holdings are. I’m sure we’ll visit there on many an occasion.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYzk0NTEzNGJjMDRkODg5ZTU5NDQzOGVkOTVmMzhm">“Cool! I can’t wait!”</p>
<p class="cnM5Nzg5NWNhMmNlYzQ2ZThiYzI0NzhlYmRkMDg2ZGRk">Serena stood up, grabbing and sheathing her marble sword in her belt, an impromptu solution while she didn’t have a sheath for it. “Let’s go,” she said, and the pair of them went down to reception. She found Amelia a rainhat, courtesy of the inn, and also found herself one that fitted her horns. Serena had Amelia tie her hair up so her blond hair didn’t stand out from the native demons.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTVjY2YwMmFlMTQ4NmRhOTEyMDYzM2I4ZGE4ZmIx">Before they left, Serena found that morning's broadsheets and cast an eye over the news. The main headline was again talking about Admiral Zhao’s progress, while in a corner of the paper was a small article titled <em>Highguard Hotel Raid</em>. Skimming through the text, Serena was relieved to find neither her nor Amelia were named, and the events of the cafe battle were not mentioned at all. Someone had put a blocker on the papers, forbidding them to report on it.</p>
<p class="cnNkOTk1NDY1NDZhMTRiNTFhZWQzN2MxY2YzMDEzNTYz">Leaving the inn they caught a tram into Central, and then hopped another one to get to the north side of the city where the academy was. The building was isolated, with a large expanse of green grass and a wall of trees protecting it from the busy city around it. It was an enormous square-shaped building similar to the inn. Unlike the inn, which had a garden in its centre, this building had an arena and training ground.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDEwNGIyNGU3NjQ1NGZhNzc0N2NlZmJmN2M4NDIz">Each corner of the academy had a pagoda-like structure reaching upwards, where the faculty would reside. At the back, there was a raised structure between the two corners where the most important offices and libraries were located.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2JmMWQyNDkzMTQxNDJiZmIzMzVjYWUwMjVhNDQ2">The gates were open and Serena and Amelia stepped through. They didn’t get far before a pair of gate guards intercepted them.</p>
<p class="cnMxODE0NGY4ZGJhYzQ5NzU4YTcwYjY1ZGMwNDZjNWI1">“Hail!” They called, their neat black uniform with silver buttons giving them a rather formal look. “The public cannot bring weapons onto the ground; who are you?” The guards eyed them suspiciously, but not so much that their hands hovered on their weapons.</p>
<p class="cnM2NjMzZTQwY2ZkNTQ1YmE5NWIwODgzYWZkYzdmNWFi">Serena raised the rainhat so they could see her face clearly. “I am Speaker Halen, here to meet the grandmaster and make use of your training facilities, if they are available.” Serena reached over and tilted Amelia’s hat. “This is Speaker Thornheart, employee of House Halen who I am teaching the sword.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NTAwZTY5ZWJmNjQ1Mjg5ZDcwYmVlMDQ5MjIzODRk">The guards glanced at each other and had a hurried discussion. Serena heard one of them mutter, “That’s really her, I saw her photo in the news.” A few moments later, they turned back towards the pair.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTIzZTJlMjg3MDQzM2VhYTAwZTU2OTlmZGFjNzI1">“One of us will guide you to the grandmaster, but you’ll need his permission for a human Speaker to enter the grounds.”</p>
<p class="cnM5OWExNGI1MTZlMjRlZmRiMzc4OTQ3NWMwMjk3ZThj">For a moment Serena thought about challenging the guard but decided against it. It wasn’t an unreasonable request and they were just doing their job. “Very well,” she said as she turned to Amelia. “Wait outside. Don’t run off. If anyone tries to make you go anywhere or do something use my name.” Serena thought for a moment. “If that doesn’t work beat them to a pulp, but avoid Speaking if you can help it.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMDRkYmEyYzQzOTQyNmY5Y2NlZThjYzBjZjA2NTA1">“O-okay! I’ll be waiting!” Amelia gave a quick thumbs up before skipping back outside the gates and sitting against the entryway.</p>
<p class="cnNkMTgwOThmOWZjNjRiNjhiZWY2NTAyNGU1OGY5NjEw">“Keep an eye on her,” she instructed the remaining guard, “Don’t try anything funny. She’s a capable Speaker.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MWIzOGZhNDBkZDQwYTM5OGFiMjAwOGFhYjE2YzY5">“Y-yes, Speaker Halen!”</p>
<p class="cnNlMTQxM2E0NWVjZjQyNzVhODkwMmViZGJjZGYzMzRl">“Let’s go,” she said to her guide, and she was led through the grounds into the depths of the building. As she was guided, she saw trainee officers striding about, chattering and carrying heavy books. It wasn’t until she passed a few instructors who recognised her, with one or two giving her salutes, that the students started casting looks in her direction and whispering amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDllYTk4ZmY1YjQ1MTBhYzgzMGViMmUwZjc3MzQx">“Who’s that?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NWZlNjc5MTAwMzRiYTI5NzhiOTkxMWI3ZTY4NTA3">“She must be important if Instructor Won saluted her…”</p>
<p class="cnNkOWYyZmE4ZjU0MjRkZWNhOTdkZmQ3M2JhYTcxZTUz">“Those horns are familiar…”</p>
<p class="cnNiOTViMmYyMDZmNDQ1OGJiZWJlYTk1ZmM4MTE4NzQy">“Is she a new instructor?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZDY2NDRkZTU3ZjRkNGE5MTkzODhhYWMxY2FlNzZh">Soon they left the gossiping students behind and she was led up multiple flights of stairs and through several corridors before stopping at a large ironwood door. A brass plaque on the front simply read <em>Director</em>. The guard rapped his knuckles against the solid wood.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzY2NGU0MTMwZDRlZmQ5NWFjNjUyNzM3M2E1ZmZm">“It’s open,” came a gruff voice from within.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzRmZjJmZjc2MDQ4NjhhYmEyYzVkOWRhMGM1NWM3">The guard opened the door, and Serena could make out an office that was best described as <em>chaotic-neatness</em>. It reminded her a little of Tome's quarters.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzRjNzhhMzE2NzQwMDA4ODcwNmYxYWE1NDFhOTU3">“Speaker Halen is here to meet with you, Director,” the guard informed.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjM2YjZmM2JlMzQ5MjQ5YzU4NmQxZTMwNjM3NjQx">“Mmm? Is that so? Well then, let her in and return to your post.”</p>
<p class="cnM1Zjk3NWFkNmE5MDQ0Zjc4ZGJmNTk3NzFhMTllOGQ2">“Yes, Director,” the guard bowed and left Serena to her own devices. She stepped into the office, greeting a pair of crimson eyes and large bull horns that looked terribly familiar.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDk3MDk1MWE4NDQwY2I5MTg3ZTc2MjZhMDU1MTJi">“Grandmaster Gu, it’s a pleasure,” Serena greeted, clasping her hands together in a tidy bow. “I believe we last met at my graduation in Asamaywa?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YjFhMTIxMzA3NzQyNzhiMGI2M2MyNzQyZGQ5YjM1">“Mmm… come here, Serena. Let’s have a look at your hands…” The grandmaster motioned for her to approach and Serena walked over to his desk. The old demon took her hands in his own and examined them with a thoughtful expression.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzkwOTNmYjUzZDRlZmQ5ZjY1NjQ0MWQ2NWVkYTYw">“Your military life has kept you busy…” He mumered, turning her hands this way and that. “I see you’ve kept your skills, even improved them. What aura can you manifest under <em>Narean</em> now?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNGZkM2VmYzNjMDQ4ODM4NjUwZDdkNzM3NzI5NjEz">“I… am just breaking into blue, grandmaster. I have reached it twice. Once under my control and the other… not.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NmE1ZTg0NzdmNDQ2ZjA4MDc3YzU2MWExZWU5YTc1">“Mmm… <em>Narean</em> can be demanding, can he not? You must train your will and determination as much as the sword itself.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTc4NzBmN2E4YjQwMmRhMTQzYzQ2OWFhYjE0MTQ1">“Yes, grandmaster.”</p>
<p class="cnM1Zjk5YTA5YzgwNjQ2ZThiZjBhOGQ0MDY5MzNiMDIz">“Still, to lose such an awful talent like yourself to my brother! A terrible tragedy! Can I not convince you to spend a few semesters here as an instructor?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNmY0NDU3YjY4NDRlMmE5NzE1ODJjOTc2MjM1NmY1">“I apologise, but my military duties take me elsewhere currently.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDQ4YTE5YjdkNzQwYjZiYmUwZTM3MDZjZGVjNjVm">“Gah! You’re wasted in the military, you know that, don’t you, Serena Halen?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjQ4MTkyMTcxYjRmOThiMjRkZTI2ZTllMTMxMmRm">“I… I’m comfortable where I am.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNDQyZGQyMGY5NDQxMWM4NzY4NDZjYzkzOTA0NWM0">“Well then,” Grandmaster Gu sighed, reclining into his chair. “For what purpose have you visited me?”</p>
<p class="cnMwYWUwMjM0MjczYTQ2MzZhNGEwZjgzMTg5NWU3M2Iy">“I-” Serena began but cut herself off. She organised her thoughts before beginning again. “There was a recent battle in the city centre, I trust you’re aware of it?” Someone of the grandmaster’s skill would easily detect the Spoken Words from yesterday. Grandmaster Gu nodded slowly.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDA1YmQyNDNjMTQ3Y2E4NTFhN2ZmMmM1OTkyNTFj">“There were two trainee cadets that died. I believe it was one Trainee Meng and one Trainee Yin.” The Grandmaster stared at her for a moment before opening his mouth.</p>
<p class="cnMyOWMzOTQ2NzQ0YjQwMWRiYmQxZTE0YmE0NjI4YjY0">“Yes, two of ours.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYzRlOGUxNDVjNjRiNTc5NDg2MTZlZjJkMTI3MGQw">“They… died following my orders. They died doing their duty.” Serena took a breath, “Through you, I would like to use my Speaker's privilege to communicate an official commendation for them both. I would like to recommend a bronze eagle each and, if possible, if you are amenable to it, for them to post-mortem graduate as commissioned officers.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MmYyNmFjOWM5MjRhMTU5MDJiMjhiODYzMTFjZWZj">The Grandmaster was silent for a dozen seconds and Serena had to make a conscious effort to avoid swallowing awkwardly.</p>
<p class="cnNlMzZlOWVlNDQ2MTQ4YWI4MmYyYzQ5ZDI5NjM2ODRj">“You… feel guilty over their deaths?” He asked her in a quiet voice.</p>
<p class="cnNiNjY1YmU3MTg4ZjQ5MmM4NDgwZDI4YWE1NWI2MDFh">“I cannot deny it… I do,” Serena muttered. The Grandmaster was quiet for another period before sighing. The demon reached into a pocket and put on a pair of spectacles. He fumbled around his desk, finding pen and paper.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDYwYjBkMjMwYjRlNGZiYTc5NDY2ODA2MTI1MDM1">“You really should consider becoming an instructor. The military isn’t for you, Speaker Halen. Now then… how would you like to word this? Best be polite; the Greatlord will be reading it.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMDg4ZGVkNDVlMTQyZTliMzliNjNhZTE4NTY3NTJk">“Ah,” Serena felt a burden lift from her. She couldn’t resurrect the dead. No-one could. What she could do was give the fallen a little honour and something for their families to ease their grieving. Over the next few minutes, she worked with Grandmaster Gu to word the recommendation properly.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjM0NjJjYmQyYTRjMWNhZTk5YzU2YzZlZjI1YzQx">“Thank you for your assistance, grandmaster,” Serena said, standing up after signing the final version. “There is one other matter I wish to cover.”</p>
<p class="cnNjZTA2ODQ0OTUyNzRjZTBiM2U0NTg2OGE2ZTRiMzk1">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="cnNiMWVhZDI5ZWY2YjQ4YWM4NjRhOGNkNzY4YmVkNTky">“Is the academy private training grounds for instructors free for use? I have another Speaker with me, someone I’ve promised to teach the sword. With your permission, I would like to make use of them.” Officially Serena didn’t need the grandmaster's permission. She even had the right to eject any non-Speakers from whatever training session they were in, but that was not a power she would abuse, especially in front of someone she respected so much.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjZhM2FjODExMzQwYmQ5ZDUwZmE4NzUwZjIyMmM0">“Another Speaker? This wouldn’t be a certain Miss Thornheart whose name I’ve been hearing here and there?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMWZjNjJkOWRkNzQ5MGQ4MmM1YmZlYWVhMmM5YWJi">“That… would be correct. I have employed her under my name for House Halen. She’s an excellent healer and has taken an interest in the sword.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NzdhMWVhNzA3MDRhOTM4NzJhZGRiNWM4ZThlZDc4">“Oh?” The grandmaster’s bushy eyebrow rose. “Does she have any talent?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NmQ1MGUxOTcwNzRjYTM4YzRiNjVjZGMxNzA4Yjgw">“It…” Serena thought about the question a little longer. “It’s hard, she’s an amateur in the sword, but being a Speaker, her constitution far outstrips even the most talented non-Speaker. It’s too early for me to tell if she has any real talent.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NzkxMDA5M2M3YzRlNmQ4YmRiNmE0YmM5Y2YzYzJl">“What’s her disposition?”</p>
<p class="cnMyMDM5ZDJiNzg0YjQxOTRiZTQ1M2JhYzNhNmIwOTkx">“She’s compassionate, excitable and optimistic. However, she is a little naive,” Serena said, giving a blunt and honest overview of Amelia’s personality.</p>
<p class="cnM2MGZlZjRkNGIxMDQ4YTlhMzVlYmYwZTJlNzA1MDlj">“Mmm… so unsuited for the military?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMTcxZTQ0ZmI0ZTQzYTU4MWRjN2RiNGFjOWU3ODIz">“That may be so, but she’s not in the chain of command. She’s merely under my employ.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmVmYzA2M2U5NzRmZmVhMWQ4MWY3M2Y2OTFlMzI3">“Have you ever considered sponsoring her for the swordsmanship courses here? Being human, she won’t be able to become an officer. I’ll never turn down a soul that’s passionate about the sword, even if they’re a human Speaker.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDBiMTI3ZGE1OTRkNjhhZjFlZTUyNWIyMDkwMDY2">Serena gave the grandmaster a wirey smile. “You haven’t even met her, and you’re already trying to pull her into your tutelage?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNWMwZTdjMGIzZTQ1ZWVhODhmODQ2ZmVhMzJjMWU1">“Tsk!” The grandmaster clicked his tongue, “I’ve lost one talented Speaker to my brother! Before I know it, he’ll take another!”</p>
<p class="cnNlZGZkNjE1NDM4OTRkNzRiYjk3Y2FlZWY5Mzc4NDk2">“I’m afraid I’ll have to decline for now,” Serena said, inclining her head as she politely refused the man. She tried to imagine Amelia as a student; her blond hair bouncing in a sea of horns as she rushed to class. It was... surprisingly easy to picture, actually. Nevertheless, she couldn't envision a pathway that would end with Amelia attending an academy. Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p class="cnM0MzhmN2MyZjQ2ZTRiYWI4MGI0ZDJmMmUxZDJkMzZh">“Stubborn…” mumbled the grandmaster. “Very well. I’ll let you use one of the private training halls. Only… I’d like to watch the session. You can’t get me excited over a prospective talent in my halls and then deny me the opportunity to witness it myself, right?”</p>
<p class="cnMyN2Y1NjA1MjhkZTQ5ZGFiZDRmYWM1MTMwYTdkY2Iz">Serena took a moment to think. It was a fair request and she had no real reason to deny it. “Alright,” she said, “What training hall is free?”</p>
<p class="cnMzODc1NzNlMDU2ODQ1NDk5MmQ0ZGJjZDQ2ZDQzOGQx">“Ah,” the grandmaster waved his hands dismissively. “I’ll come with you to get her, and then we’ll go together and find a hall. Where is she now?”</p>
<p class="cnMzY2MyNTNhNTkwZTQ5YTFiZWUzYjc2Mjg1ZjM1NmJh">“I left her at the gate with the guard. They weren’t willing to let a human Speaker onto the grounds without your permission.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MTU0ZGE4NTAyNzQzYjg4ZThjZTdjMmQ0MGVkODk3">“Damn straight,” the grandmaster snorted. “We’re at war. Can’t be too careful. Come on then, Speaker Halen. Let’s get these old bones moving.” The old demon clambered up. His clothing hid his body but Serena could tell from his movements that underneath he possessed an iron body that would rival any younger demon’s effort.</p>
<p class="cnM3NzdjYTY2NzEzMjRiNjU4ZjQ5Y2I2ZTdiOWVhNmE3">Together they left the office and returned to the gate. There they found the gate guard sweating nervously. Amelia stood nearby, idly kicking rocks and pebbles and whistling awkwardly.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmI5MTdkODkyYzRjZjBiY2NlN2E2YjM4NWVkZjQx">“Uh, hello,” She said, “A little problem…”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZGU0NzEyMmYzZDQyYmViZDE0OTc5OGYzZWVjYmVh">Serena took a moment to mentally prepare herself. “What’s happened?” Amelia gestured to the side and Serena turned her head to see a demon encased in the ground. Earth magic had been used to wrap him in stone, leaving only his head sticking out. Serena grinned before taking her time to pace over to the grumbling demon.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTEyMTNkN2U0NDQxYWE5MzYyNDE4MTNjMzFlOGI3">“Serena!” The trapped demon begged, “Tell her I’m not an assassin! This is very humiliating!”</p>
<p class="cnNhZGYwOGZjZDVkOTQ3YzBiNmJiZTBhYThlNmJmOGVj">“Hrmph!” Amelia folded her arms, looking away. “You might not be an assassin, but you’re definitely a weirdo! What kind of strange man tries to give a young, innocent girl like myself alcohol in broad daylight? Creep!”</p>
<p class="cnM3YjY5MGNjYzk4MjQwNDA5NDlkNzBlMGFiYTI3Njc1">Serena tapped her foot against the stone encasing the poor demon. “Why did I never think to do this myself?” She pondered out loud. “So, what can we do for you, Officer Adachi?”</p>

      <description>Chapter Twenty-Two: Grandmaster Grandpa</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMzOGQ1ZTA5YzE3YTQ4NWU5N2IxZWZkYWM2NDBjNmU0"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNhZTFmMTJiOWU1NzQ2MjFhMjBmMTI4MWRiNmQyYTcx">“How’d this happen, then?” Serena asked Amelia, lightly kicking the stone encasing the complaining demon.</p>
<p class="cnMwMTRiYjYyNmFmYjQwM2Y4NDk3ZGM3ZDRlNTcxN2E3">“This <em>weirdo</em>,” Amelia made sure to emphasise that word for extra effect, “Came up to me like some homeless beggar and tried to get me to go with him to some <em>traveller’s bed</em> or whatever! Shameless!”</p>
<p class="cnM1NjA1NTY5ZTJmMjRmOGNiZDYzMDU4MzFiY2VmM2Q3">“Is that so?” Serena intoned, drawing her marbled sword, “Which bit do you want me to cut off first, <em>Aiden the Drunk?</em>” The blade glowed red as aura coursed through it, causing the trapped demon’s eyes to shake in panic. There was an older demon with Serena who was watching the events with an amused expression on his face. He looked old and gave her a grandfather vibe, but Amelia’s instincts told her he was on par if not more dangerous than Serena was.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTYyODg0MjA3NDQ4MzlhMWY0N2EwYzFkZTA4MTlk">A Speaker of at least one Word, for sure.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzMyYmEyY2NhNjQwNzZiYmZlODg1OTc1M2M0YzZk">“T-traveller’s Rest!” The trapped demon cried, “Traveller’s Rest! It’s a new pale ale from the Sabanis Dominance! I thought we could get a drink while we waited for you to do whatever you were doing! And…” The trapped demon eyed the blade nervously. “It’s <em>Aiden The Drinker</em>, remember!? Unbeaten and unrivalled!?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDZhYzQxMjQ4MzQ4ZWRiNjI4OTFlOGFhYmNlNjVl">“Hmm…” Serena tilted her head, a mock expression of thoughtfulness painted on her face. “I’m not sure you’re deserving of that title anymore. Just last night, the pair of us put away one, two…” Serena counted on one hand, “... <em>three</em> bottles of <em>green</em> loqua, and the same amount of blue.” She waved the three raised fingers in the face of the demon called Aiden The Drunk.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWFmNTE2MDU0NTQ5MTI5NjI3NDQ2NWU1MzU4YWNk">“You… you drank loqua? Without me!?” Aiden protested before flicking his eyes between Amelia and Serena. “But… how are you both not hungover? That should- oh.” He cut himself short, a moment of realisation as his eyes settled on Amelia, who strode over and crossed her arms as she towered over the encased demon.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzI1MmE5N2YzZDQ2NTQ5Y2QwM2JhZGY4MTg4Nzcx">It sure felt good to look down on others like this! Amelia made a mental decision to avoid positions of power when possible. Although… would it be so bad? A ruler who looked this cute would automatically do amazing, right?</p>
<p class="cnNmY2IwM2QxYzUxMzRhZmJhZjFkOTlhZGYzOGVlZDY3">“So you’re the one who’s supposed to be doing a profile on me, huh?” She said, trying to inject as much disapproval as possible into her voice. “<em>Well</em>, I’ll be sure to send Centralis my own report on the conduct of their employees! I even have a witness!” Amelia gestured to the sweating gate guard who looked like he was going to bolt at any moment.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTI4NTk1ZDA2MTQ5ODBhZGY1ZmUyZmU0N2U4ZDM0">“Wouldn’t be so sure of that,” Serena said with a smile. Amelia saw her looking with amusement at the nervous guard. “Did Officer Adachi mention he was with Intelligence? Mention my name?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNmQ3YjI4NzE0ZjQ0YTg5ZTY0YjhkYzBmMzZiNjc2">“Uh…” she mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzY4MjBkODIzYjQ2MGZiNjhhNzliNmNhODFhODdh">“Yes!” exclaimed Aiden. “Yes, I did! I told her we were friends at the academy!”</p>
<p class="cnMwZmI2NTI1OGUyNTQzMGY4YzQ0Y2Y3YTU0OGZmNDRj">“Alright, <em>fine!</em>” Amelia clicked her tongue. “He may have mentioned <em>something</em> along those lines, but you should have seen how he approached me! He was all so arrogant and confident! Like he’s never been rejected by a woman before! It pissed me off, so I…” She trailed off, realising this wasn’t making her sound very good at all. “... put him in the ground…” she mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2U1ODcwYmI5MjQzMzJhODJmMGY4MTNjZDIyNzM4">“I see…” Serena said. Amelia watched her eyes feeling a hint of regret rising in her stomach. Thankfully, Serena seemed more amused by the situation instead of being angered. It looked like Aiden The Drunk really was an old friend.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2M1ZjM1MWIwMzQ5NDI4YzhiNTRkYmRlZDFlOGM1">“Anyway,” Serena continued, “Amelia, this is Grandmaster Gu, Lord and Director of the Kenhoro Officer Academy. He has kindly allowed us to use the private training facilities for our lesson, and he will be observing our progress. His skill and insights will be invaluable to the both of us.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMmI3N2YwNGEwYTRlMDA4MWNjYzQ4N2EwMzIwOGFj">Oh? This old demon was actually someone amazing! Amelia bounced up to him, giving him her best version of a traditional Manwese bow. “Nice to meet you, grandpa!”</p>
<p class="cnM5Mjg1Y2ZjMDBiMzQyMThiYjBlMzJmMTYyYjViOTUx">“G-grandpa!?” Both Serena and Grandmaster Gu stuttered in unison.</p>
<p class="cnMzZGJjZjU3OGUyMjRjNjE5NWFlOTBiZTVhYzM5OWQ0">“Thanks for letting us use your facilities! I can’t wait!” She flashed the old demon her second-best smile. The best one was, of course, only shown to Serena!</p>
<p class="cnMwM2UyMjY1NTVjNjRjYjQ5MWY2YjJiMDc4ODdlMzhk">“Hrmph, well…” Grandmaster Gu mumbled, rubbing his beard and looking to the side. He murmured something strange about always wanting a granddaughter, but Amelia chose to ignore it. Everyone was a little weird, right? She was happy to forget an old demon’s idiosyncrasies if he could help teach both her and Serena!</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDlmZWUyODAyMDQ1NjhhODc1MWYwY2Q5NjI1YTYx">“If you three are done becoming a family, could someone please <em>get me the hell out of here</em>!” The trapped demon cried in frustration. Amelia rolled her eyes. So dramatic! She agitated the aether inside her. The movement of her reserves and her ability to manifest spells was noticeably easier than when she had first arrived. Her intuition - backed by stats boosted by thousand-hour grinds - was becoming more reliable and more straightforward to understand by the day.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzU5NzcwMDJiNDQ2OWRhOTU2MGEyYjI2ZGZlZDBl">The aether obeyed her command and the stone flowed like liquid off Aiden. He rolled to his side, groaning in relief and Amelia made the extra effort to smooth the pavement. It didn’t look <em>quite</em> the same as before, but it was good enough. Maybe it would become a tourist spot! A place where the students would whisper stories in excited tones. Tales of when <em>Amelia Thornheart</em> - House Halen’s most powerful maid - defended <em>Serena Halen</em> - Cascadia’s prettiest demon - from a lecherous drunk and his antics!</p>
<p class="cnNjZDA2ZGYxYmRhMjQxM2M4MWM4YWM2ZDk2ODZkZGQy">Yup! That was how she would tell the story in the future!</p>
<p class="cnMyZWMyODNmOTM3ODQ0Y2JhNzQ1OGFiZjNiYjM3YjU2">Aiden gathered himself. His clothes were dusty and dirty, and it was <em>kind of</em> Amelia's fault so she reached out with a cleaning spell and made him look new. The demon looked over himself in wonder before turning his eyes to her. “That was your magic?” He asked, and Amelia nodded in reply.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODUwOGY0ZmUwNzRmZGZhOWY1ZGU1YjQ0ZWJiMjRh">“You’re welcome!” She said before offering her hand to him. “Sorry about all that, I was… surprised, you know?” Amelia wiggled her outstretched hand. “We can be friends, right!?”</p>
<p class="cnMyZDY3ZDQxMzYxNTQyODE5N2M5NTE4MTJhZjc3MDQy">Aiden eyed the wiggling hand suspiciously. “You’re not going to turn me into a fish or anything?” He asked with a raised eyebrow before shaking her hand.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTRmYmE2NDc5NzQ2NDE5NGJiNDIyNWIyYTdjNzQ4">Amelia giggled but didn’t answer his question. Could she turn him into a fish? She ran her mind over the countless demonic spells she had memorised, trying to remember if there were any that could polymorph another person. Before she could find one, Serena interrupted her thoughts.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2I0OGUzMTM1YzQ4ZjdhYjliZTk5M2E3ZTBiYTE0">“Grandmaster Gu. As you may have gathered, this is Speaker Thornheart,” Serena coughed lightly into her hand. “She can be a bit <em>forward</em>,” for some reason, Serena glared at her when she emphasised that word. Weird. “But she’s rather friendly. Shall we proceed? Officer Adachi, would you like to watch?”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTViM2VhNjlmYzRlNDM4OTFlMGJjYzZhMDk3MzA3">“You’re inviting me?” Aiden asked, looking surprised.</p>
<p class="cnMyMmM4ODk1ZWRmODRhOGQ5ZmQyMmYxYTBmMjY1ZTY4">“Well, I was hoping to speak to you about yesterday's events, and I figured you might as well be introduced to Speaker Thornheart before the festival.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YzVjN2Q5ZmUzYjQxMGE5NmE2OGI2MTQ3ZDQ1ZjYy">“Right… right. I’d be delighted to come along. If it’s alright with Grandmaster Gu?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzQyMGQ4YTBmMzQyMmY4NGMwMTAwODY4NzQ3M2U2">Grandmaster Gu rubbed his beard. “I don’t see why not,” he said. In response, Aiden gave a quick bow and fell in line as they marched towards the academy’s front door leaving behind the fumbling gate guard.</p>
<p class="cnNkOGUxZDQ2ODc5MDRiODM5Yzk1YTE0ZTk4ZWMwOGZm">The building was almost entirely made of wood, with only a stone foundation and paper windows. Above the enormous front door was a huge wooden beam that looked like someone had attacked it with a sword. “What’s that about?” She asked, pointing to the damaged wood.</p>
<p class="cnM5OGZkMmFiMjc0YzQzZTlhYWQ3NjJkOWRjZDg4YWRl">Behind her, Aiden groaned, Serena snorted, and the Grandmaster chuckled. “I’ll tell you later,” Serena said, “It’s a funny story.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNjA0NzZjZDU5YzRiZGVhODFiZWQxNTVkODY5YzQx">“Sure!” Amelia responded, trying to think of reasons why someone would carve sword marks into wood.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWVhYTA3ZTNiNDQ0ZWE5ODM0YjE3MjAwNjM1YTA4">The group of them entered the academy with its flowing students and wide corridors. The paper windows let in a large amount of natural light, although Amelia could see aetherlights had been installed throughout the building. Given that the building was one huge fire hazard, it made sense not to have gas lamps.</p>
<p class="cnM1OTY3OGY5ZDZiOTQ0NjliN2VlNzEzODdjZWZiMjk1">As they travelled, the passing students all bowed to the Grandmaster; even the older-looking demons who Amelia guessed were teachers bowed deeply. Students and teachers alike wore coloured belts. Many were gray but she often saw students with red belts and some with orange. All the teachers seemed to wear yellow belts.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmEwNzMzYmFlZDQzZTlhMWJhNWU4MGU0YThlMTdh">“What do the belt colours mean?” She whispered.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODVmOGUwNzUwZTRmYWM4MmRmZWMwZDEyNzQ3Y2Jl">“The highest rank aura they can manifest,” Serena whispered back, “Red is the first and easiest, followed by orange and yellow. Yellow is the minimum requirement to become an academy instructor.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGMzYzU3YjFlMTQyYTRiODhlZjFkYjI3NWYwMmFm">“None of the instructors can Speak?” She asked. All the instructors they had passed had yellow belts, but none had the telltale green signifying fourth-level aura.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTkwMmE3YjFlZjQ5NDlhOWFiNTBlMzY0MTQzYzQ0">“Some can,” Serena answered, “But Speakers don’t advertise their capabilities so freely. Yellow is the highest aura they’ll admit to publicly.” Amelia nodded at that reasoning. It was in line with what Serena had told her about Speakers previously. Amelia reinforced the existing mental note she had made about not being forthcoming regarding her ability to Speak any Second Words. Serena had, on more than one occasion, <em>very </em>firmly explained how important it was to keep that secret until Cascadia had truly incorporated her as a citizen of the Empire.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmIyNDhlNDkwZDQzNjE4ZDQ1Yjc0NDk2MTFiZjg1">After a few minutes of walking, they eventually entered a large training hall. Half of the floor was sand, while the other half was a wooden platform raised a quarter step above the ground. The room had a high ceiling and no windows. It was lit by several rows of aetherlights circling the wooden walls.</p>
<p class="cnM5NTAyOThiZDM1YzRkMTZhOWM1NzczMjgzMWEwOWE0">“There is an enchantment on the room,” said Grandmaster Gu as he closed the door behind them. “Unless you break the walls themselves, no sound will escape.” He brought the group to one side, which was lined with racks of wooden swords and weights. “Well then, Speaker Halen. You are her instructor. I’ll observe… for now.”</p><span class="cjEzNmU0MDhkNjEzMjQ1MzViM2NhNWU3YWEyZGY4ZjA0"><br/>This text was taken from Royal Road. Help the author by reading the original version there.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNiMjViMzk2MWRiNTRjZTZiNzUzMGI1YjFjMzY2Yzdi">“T-thank you, Grandmaster Gu,” Serena said. Amelia couldn’t help frowning at her stuttering. Was Serena nervous? Did she want to impress the Grandmaster herself? Well then! She would do her very best as a disciplined and hardworking student to make <em>Sensei Halen</em> look as good as possible! Sadly, she wouldn’t be able to openly flirt with her girlfriend, but she was sure the pair of them could catch up that very night.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjgxMjU2Y2JmNTQ0ZmQ4M2M1ZTNlMDMwOGM4YjFm">“Take this,” Serena said, handing her a four-foot wooden sword with a small circular guard. “Hold it out like this,” Serena demonstrated by holding her arm out to her side as straight as an arrow. Amelia copied the motion obediently. “Does it feel light?” Serena asked, and Amelia nodded. Her sword was taken from her and Serena handed her another, slightly heavier sword.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODE1YmU3MDgzMjRhYzQ5NjljNWQ3NzIxNGNmYTZm">Putting her arm out again, Amelia found she could barely feel any difference between this and the last one. “Still light,” She said to Serena, who took another wooden sword and swapped it out with her current one. This repeated for another five or six swords until Amelia started to feel the slightest stress on her shoulders when holding out the weapon.</p>
<p class="cnM0YmQ2ZmE1ZjcwYTQzNzI5MDc4MDY5YTQwZTI0ZDc4">“This one feels slightly heavy,” she said. Serena nodded, taking the sword from her. She looked thoughtful for a second and then took a previous sword Amelia had already determined to be too light and gave it to her.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDVhOGVkYTMxYzQzNjI4YmYyY2NmNjI5ZGZmNjc3">“Christ… starting with the number eight,” Aiden muttered from the side.</p>
<p class="cnM1MGE3YWQ2YjgxNTRkMWY5MDkyODQwNDBjNGM5NWI0">“Use this one. It might feel light now, but when you’ve been swinging for an hour, it’ll put your untrained muscles to the test.” Serena flashed a glance at the pair observing them. “We’ll go through some stretches to warm up. Here’s how you should hold your sword in both hands,” Serena demonstrated, instructing Amelia how to move each finger individually to wrap the handle properly.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDcxN2M0MmE5ZTRiNmY4YjZmMWMxZDFjZmZiNTUx">After her grip was sorted Serena had her hold the sword while moving through the katas she knew. This time she was instructed to exaggerate her stances so her tendons and muscles would stretch and relax as she progressed through the sequenced movements.</p>
<p class="cnNhN2RlNTU3NGZhYTQyMTdiMWI1MGU3MDJhZThkMmYx">Amelia noted that unlike on the bridge of the <em>Vengeance</em>, Serena wasn’t barking orders at her. She was - if anything - speaking <em>softly</em> to her. Amelia wondered if that was because they were in a much more private setting or because there was a super important grandmaster watching.</p>
<p class="cnNlY2M4OGY2NDNiNjQ2N2M5YWQ5MzU3NjdiZGQ3ZDgy">Or was it because they slept together?</p>
<p class="cnM2NDFiMGRlNTA0YjQwOTY4YzM1YjQ0ZGFmYmY0Mjc0">She hoped it was that reason.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGJiYjk4MjA4ZjRmZjhhM2E4MDcwZTlhNTI1ZmY0">“This is <em>shomen</em>,” Serena demonstrated, striking down her sword in a perfect downward slash. “It’s the vertical strike. Try to perform it now while in <em>hachiji-dachi</em>, the natural stance.” Amelia attempted to copy the strike as instructed, but it was… messy. Her perception was incredibly high but all that meant was that she could see even more <em>clearly</em> how bad her rendition of <em>shomen</em> was.</p>
<p class="cnNjMWQ4ZWMwZTU4ZDQzMWJiZDQzZTAyMTBjZGFjY2I1">Serena had her make another dozen strikes before she began correcting her. “Tense your lats when you make your strike; try again.” Amelia followed as best she could, and the moment she got the hang of one change another adjustment was made.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTJjYmY0YWI5NDQ2ZmViMDdiZjRhNzRmNDc1MDJl">“Your shoulders are raising upwards. This happens when the lats are relaxed at the start. They should always be slightly tensed.”</p>
<p class="cnM4YzE3OTAwMzQyNTQ0MmZiZWIyZDUwYzk3N2Y1MmRl">“Your grip is too tight. When you grip something too tightly, muscles in the forearm will hinder your movement.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTBmMmQ2YTVjOTRhODliNzZkMTI2YzdmY2U2ODA4">“Breathe out a little when you strike; breathe in when you prepare.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNjc1ZTQzZmZjNjRmYjI5MTZjNGRhZmVhMGIwZDNi">As the instructions came, Amelia sank deeper into her focus. Any urges to be cheeky or tease Serena vanished as Amelia became fully determined to master this one strike. With every suggestion Serena made, the path Amelia’s sword made looked steadier and steadier. Her game character knew Words regarding martial arts, but that was only because Amelia had spent spare points unlocking them. She had never actually geared out her demonic mage as a melee build to try it out.</p>
<p class="cnNkMjgxZjRhZWVlNTQxYmZiYWVlODQ3NjdlMTNlZDEy">Amelia had raw power. In the sword and especially in magic. What she didn’t have was <em>experience</em>. She was certain her focus on magic in the game had created a natural magical intuition regarding using aether in this world, but the same could not be said for swinging a sword. Every improvement she made to her swing was something she <em>earned</em> through focus and effort.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjhhYTgxMWU2MDRkOGFhZGVjZWY5MWU0YTQ3MjUz">It was because of that Amelia - the demonic combat mage - was falling in love with the sword.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjU4YWFjNjRkZjQ0Y2ViMDQxNzNmM2FjZGZkZGYz">“Well done,” Serena said, a small smile on her lips. It seemed the previous nervousness had vanished and her girlfriend was in full <em>Sensei</em> mode. “Now we will cover <em>keisa-giri</em>. This is a diagonal cut from the shoulder to the kidney. It looks like this,” Serena demonstrated the strike and Amelia thought it looked perfect. Would she ever be able to duplicate that? To strike so cleanly with no wasted movement?</p>
<p class="cnNhNTU5OWE2N2ZlNzQ4ODA4ZmUwMDQ4MTg4MDYwNjhi">“You need to change how you move slightly when you make this strike,” Serena explained, guiding Amelia’s body through the motions slowly at first and then at increasing speed. Like before, Amelia would make several dozen attempts before Serena would point out a single thing to fix, and then Amelia would focus on that until Serena was satisfied.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjAxOTQ5MzVjMjQ0MDBhNTQ4NmI4MGY1Y2M3NmQz">After an unknown amount of time, Serena took Amelia through her katas which she had used to practice her stances. This time she would swing the sword as she moved into each stance, making either <em>shomen,</em> the vertical cut, or <em>keisa-giri, </em>the diagonal one.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjI3NDFkYzkxNTQ0OThhNmY0ODVlMzJkZDk0OGUz">There were still movements in the kata that had sword movements Amelia hadn’t learnt but she was instructed to skip them and continue on. After running through the movements a few more times, Serena taught her how to block an incoming vertical or diagonal attack. It took a while for Amelia to get used to the angle but eventually she became comfortable with it.</p>
<p class="cnM3YmU3ZGI1ZTQ4NTQ3ZDdiYzFkZDAzZmU5ZDFhM2Yx">Next, Serena took her through <em>three-step</em> sparring<em>,</em> which were formalised ways of attacking and defending in pairs. One side would take three steps, striking in a pre-defined way while the other would back away, defending with their weapon. Then the roles would reverse and the defender would attack. At the end, both individuals would step back and bow to each other.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjU5ZmI0OWUzYTQzZjVhOWQ5NGRkMzVhMjk3ZWZi">Amelia grinned as she blocked an incoming strike from Serena. This was fun! There was so much to learn and it was so tremendously <em>satisfying</em> to learn it! She would make her own stone sword when she got back to the inn that night and keep practising.</p>
<p class="cnNiODg3MDMxZDZkNTRlNTg4NDNjYWJlNTU3ZWIwNjE3">“Alright,” Serena said after they had finished and bowed to each other. “Let’s take a break and have some food. It’s been two hours.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MTYwYTYwYTBiZDQ1ZDlhNzQyNzM5MWJiYjYxZDRi">“Two hours!?”</p>
<p class="cnM1OTAwNDhmNGM0YzRmYTNiODc3NGQ0NDZhNDZjNTYw">“Yes. It’s lunchtime. How do your arms feel?”</p>
<p class="cnMxNjc4YTU4MTUxODQyZDQ5N2M1ZDk0NmI1YTg1YjQx">“They feel good. My shoulders are aching a little, though!”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDAxM2FhZTYyZDRhMjQ4NzM5NWVkYTE5MTM2MTc1">Serena nodded, “The shoulder muscles are small and easily exhausted. I imagine they’ll be sore tomorrow. Try and resist healing yourself. I think I remember that magical healing can reduce the efficiency of muscle training.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MTgyZWI3YmE3MjQ3OWRhYWJiNDM3ZjIwMTQwMDQz">“O-okay!” Amelia didn’t want to heal away muscle soreness unless it was so bad she couldn’t move. She <em>wanted</em> to feel the soreness the next day. It meant she had worked hard and had improved! The pair of them joined the Grandmaster and Aiden who were nibbling on steaming buns that made her stomach rumble.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDg2MjQ3NzZjZDQ4N2RhNDIxY2FiNDVmZTQ1MDJi">“This brings me back,” Serena said taking a bun and handing one to Amelia. They were hot but not so much they were uncomfortable to eat. Amelia figured she could probably eat lava and be okay but that didn’t mean she would be comfortable doing it. “I lived on these in the academy,” Serena mumbled with a dash of affection in her voice.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzQyOTI2ZGUxODRlMWNhYWQ3MmVkOTI0Yzc2ZGI3">Amelia took a bite and found some meat inside. “They’re good but a bit bland. Could do with some spices, I think.” She said.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDcxYTc4OGQwMTQ2OTI5NzIwMGRkMWExNmRhYWU4">“They are intentionally bland,” the Grandmaster piped up. “It’s an old tradition. The idea is that all excitement and focus should come from the sword and the training. Delicious food would only distract the mind.”</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2RmZmFhZmVhODRmNjBiMjJlMzQ1NTkyOGYzMmM5">Amelia nodded. “That makes sense, thanks grandpa!” She gave him a cheerful thumbs up.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTZkZjA2MGJlYTQzMDJiZmM0Y2M2YjRjYmJlY2Iy">“Ack! Ack!” Serena choked on her food before swallowing audibly. “Ahem, excuse me,” she said, patting her chest. “After we’ve eaten, we’ll go through some very light sparring before heading back to clean up,” Serena paused, “Although… we wouldn’t need to…”</p>
<p class="cnM4M2JhMTJlYTljNzRmNzZhOTExOGU1MzRkOGIxMzU2">“Sure!” Amelia chirped. She could just magically clean them of any dirt and sweat once the training was over. “I’d like to explore the city a bit more, if that’s okay?”</p>
<p class="cnM1OTQwNzljMTk2ZTQzZjQ5OTY5Njc5MTI0MGQ2MmFi">“We’ll go through the market on the way back to the docks. I need to see what’s going on with the repairs.” With that, the four of them ate in silence for a moment. Amelia tried to focus on the training, but her mind wandered to other things that had happened that day.</p>
<p class="cnM0YWYzN2M1ODEwNDQwN2ViYjllOGRkYmVlODY4NzAy">“So…” she began, “What’s the sword marks above the entrance about?” Her question caused a ripple of amusement and mirth in the group.</p>
<p class="cnM4NDY1ZWZhYjI0ODQ3NWE4NzJkNDY4NTM3M2U4N2Zi">“It’s a joke,” Serena said as she swallowed her last bite. “It’s a jest played on the first-years by the seniors. Here and also in the academy back in Asamaywa.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNDQ2NzRlN2QzZTRlNGRiMjNiOTQ1MDgzNDQwYmE0">“A joke?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NGNiYzY1MjA0MjQwZmU4MjkzOGY3MjJjNzgwNDQ3">“Right, so what happens is some fresh-faced trainee from Centralis earns their placement here or in another academy in the East, where all the best swordsmen and women are,” Serena nodded her head at the Grandmaster, who tilted his in response. “They arrive, and they see these mysterious sword marks on the wood. ‘What’s that?’ They ask."</p>
<p class="cnNkM2VhMzEwM2Q4MTQyYmRhYmEyZjU0ZDU1MTM2M2Nl">“Then a senior appears and tells them, ‘That’s the hidden technique of the ancient master who built this academy centuries ago. Only the person who truly understands the sword can decipher this ultimate technique said to strike down Speakers!’ Ha!” Serena laughed.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDA1YzAwMjQ1OTQ5ZGVhYWZkYjg5NmRmOTc1NWM0">“Why’s that funny?” Amelia asked. “It sounds cool!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NDk0Zjg3OWE3MDRjM2VhZjE1OGIxNTJjNDdmMDEx">“Because those sword marks are changed every year - often by the winner of that year’s academy tournament. The sword marks mean nothing! I added my own back when I won at the end of my third year, before graduation.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNzE4ZDVkMTNhYjRiZWJiMDg3OTY3NzU5ZTdjODMx">“You added a smiley face, didn’t you?” Aiden said, grinning.</p>
<p class="cnM0NWNmYzRmZWJiODQzNzBiMzNjMjFkMWFkYWYwZDZk">“That’s right! If you tilt your head like this,” Serena tilted her head awkwardly to the side, “It looks like a smiley face. I even added a little tongue! The Grandmaster made me change it a little as it was too obvious.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MWY5NDEyOGVjYzQxMzlhMzFmMjdlNGZkMjZiZTI1">Serena, Aiden, and Amelia all laughed at that, and even the Grandmaster gave a hearty chuckle.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzNkNjk3MDU2NTRhNTBiZWI4ZmJjZGE1YjViOTMy">“It has some value,” Serena explained. “It gets the first-years riled up and focused. Some of them go through the entire first year without it being explained to them! Sometimes we would take bets to see when a certain person would realise the joke or not. Ah… good times…” She leaned back on her hands, smiling.</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2Q2ZWVmZDBkNTRhNzRhMjBkZTRmOTA4NjU3MzAw">"Took two semesters before somebody told me," grumbled Aiden.</p>
<p class="cnM5MGIzM2VjY2YwZDQ4NjliNjk1MGRmNmI0OGE4Njgz">"You were told earlier, but you were drinking so much you kept forgetting!" Serena said, laughing.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDFhODk1NTVjNTRjZjBiOWVlMzBlNzRiMDY1YzJh">“You youngsters aren’t the only ones having fun,” Grandmaster Gu said, standing up. “When I last went to see my brother, I think this was two years ago now…” The old demon straightened his posture, looking dignified. “My brother was late returning from a trip, so I was met with all the instructors to welcome me to the academy. They led me to the front gate, and I stopped like this,” The Grandmaster tilted his head up with a mock expression of surprise.</p>
<p class="cnM1NThlNmMwZjcyMzQ3MWVhNzI1NGNlMDFhYjE0ODVl">“‘By the fell gods, what heights has my brother’s sword reached now? What next, will he split the very heavens apart?’ Ha! And then I left the instructors there, and I swear they spent the entire evening second-guessing and arguing!”</p>
<p class="cnM4N2RiNjA1MjZjNjQ0YTFiNjg2MWJhYzQwNjhlMzJi">The four of them burst out laughing. Amelia grinned in happiness. She loved this! A group of people just sitting about having a good time. One girlfriend, one grandpa, and possibly a drinking buddy. They made a good group and Amelia knew she would fondly remember this for a long time.</p>
<p class="cnMzY2I3OWU0ZmZjZTRlZjg5Y2NjZGM5ZDE1ZTQ4ZWNm">“Serena,” said the Grandmaster as he sat back down. “How long will you be in Kenhoro?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NGIyMWY3ZmFiNDQ5YjU5MDM2YWM4Nzc5OTZlMTQ3">“Likely no longer than a month, maybe three weeks. The Greatlord is sending us extra pairs of horns to assist our ship repairs.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YTQ1NGRjYzBmOTQ5YTNiMmMxNzdkYzBiNDMzYjM0">“The pair of you should make use of this hall daily. I’ll make sure it’s available.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNDU1Yjc3OGM4MDQ4NTNhNTQ0NzBhYTNlOGQ3YmY0">“Ah - it’s very kind of you but-”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODUyMWRlOGQ3MDRkOTBhODMzZGUzMWYxOWFiNWY2">“I will also personally give you daily training. Let’s see if we can secure that blue aura.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MGVmNjExNDliNzRjZmViYTgyMTAzYzM3ZDNlNzEz">“I happily accept,” Serena tilted her head, “Thank you, Grandmaster.” Amelia found the quick turn-around amusing. Private tutoring from a Grandmaster must be extremely valuable for Serena to change her mind so quickly. She was also delighted with this arrangement. She could train in the sword every day! How much better would she be in a month!?</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmM4YWUxYmRmNjQwMTdhMmYyYWJjYmZhMjNkMjcz">“You broke into blue?” Aiden asked, his eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p class="cnMzMGY2MDUwNTYzMDQ0MGFiODFlYzdhYWQ3YTFmMWNl">“Just about,” answered Serena.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjgxODAzOWRiYjQzNDRiNWViZjAzMTBkNGViNzYx">“That’s incredible. You always were an unbelievable talent, but to hit <em>blue</em>. I mean… well done, friend.” Aiden raised a cup of water as a toast.</p>
<p class="cnMyZmExNzUxMDJlNzRjM2VhOTkyYWU4NTU0Njk5YzQz">“What about you? Ever thought of returning to training?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTY5YTBhYjk1YTRlOGJiMjk2NTMwZmE4NDRkYjk1">“Ah, I’m afraid not,” Aiden said, glancing awkwardly at the Grandmaster sitting next to him, “I was told there was an infinite number of ways to swing a sword, so I decided I would also prove there are as many variations of beer!”</p>
<p class="cnM3N2Y3OTc1MDFlMDQ5ZGM5YzcyNmNlZDhmZTkzNjZl">“You idiot,” Serena said.</p>
<p class="cnMyMTdiZGZmMWE3ZTQ0NDJiOTZjMmZhZDZlZDNlY2Zm">“Mister Adachi,” the Grandmaster intoned, “Although you may have lost your way, you’re welcome to attend our future sessions. Who knows, perhaps a sword will find its way into your hand again?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MTQ4MjljNTY3NjQ3YjY4Njk5YTIwODNiNDQ1ODg3">“Ah… We’ll have to see, I guess…” Aiden rubbed his chin awkwardly.</p>
<p class="cnMyMTg4N2YzZTkxMDQyNDQ5YjVlYjk2MWY5ODQ0Njdm">“Shall we resume the lesson?” Serena asked, fixing her eyes on Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWY5ZjExZDgyMDQzMTM5ZDM3NDhlMGRhYjA1NjZj">“Uh, sure!” Amelia jumped up. She was excited to continue, to experience that satisfying feeling of progress again!</p>
<p class="cnM2NTE2ODFiOTI4NTQwOTViMzA0YTU0ZDBmOTgyNmU1">“If it’s okay with you, Speaker Halen,” grumbled the Grandmaster as he clambered up. “I would like to take over the remainder of today’s session.” He cast his pair of eyes over Amelia. They were almost as crimson as Serena’s. Almost.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjg1YWMzY2UxNjQ0YmJiNDkzNzExMDVkZDFmMGI2">“Let’s see what you’re really capable of then, Speaker Thornheart,” said the Grandmaster, pulling a much heavier sword from the wall and gesturing for Amelia to join him. There was a glint of something in his eyes. Amelia swallowed, suddenly feeling nervous, before shuffling over obediently.</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2ZjMjRkOGEyOTQwMDFiYjY5M2JjY2ZmOTExZWE2">Maybe this grandpa was scary, after all.</p>

      <description>Chapter Twenty-Three: Tea With The Empress</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM3NGEzODM3ZDEyMDQxMTNiZDhmOTBhYzg3N2Y5MTdl"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM4OTA2NDUzZDU5MzQwMzk4ZGQ5ZmY3OGYzNGJhYjVj">Amelia blocked the three-strike combination with ease. Now that she knew how to tense the muscles in the right places to avoid her guard collapsing, defending against the attacks that came in a half-second was becoming satisfyingly easy.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWQxN2IxNmNmMDRiZDM4MmZhMzFiNmRiZjEyY2Ji">Another dozen swings came at her from the grandmaster. At first, it was a challenge, but then Amelia understood it was only a matter of figuring out how to move her body in a way that could keep up with her perception. She could <em>see</em> every attack and follow the sword's path through the air. Seeing, however, was very different from being able to do something about it.</p>
<p class="cnNhYWQ0Y2Q5YTU3OTRlNWM4MmQ4MzJjMWQ0YWUwZDkz">A swing from an unfamiliar direction came at the end of the combination, and the strike broke through her improvised deflection before stopping at the centre of her chest.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWZkZGZiNjM2YTQzMDc4NTk4NWNlM2M5MjlkNjUz">“That was <em>mune-tsuki</em>, the chest thrust,” The grandmaster grumbled. “Here, this is how you deflect it.” Amelia was shown in ever-increasing detail how to defend against a thrust. She gave her utmost attention, not wanting to disappoint the old man.</p>
<p class="cnNlOWE1ZWYyN2VhMDRlMjBhY2ViOTIxYTI0OTg5ZDM1">Besides, he was a <em>little</em> intimidating. Amelia’s instincts reassured her that the defences of her layered wards would hold against anything he could throw at her, but that didn’t stop the sheer <em>presence </em>of the demon keeping her on edge. Every one of his movements felt, at a moment's notice, like it could snap into a deadly attack. Furthermore, having a sword swing at her face faster than her body could react often triggered a flinching reaction that she was trying her best to overcome.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzI1YmZkNGE0MjQ4MDlhZTg5MTBiMDZhOTUyZjUz">Beyond that, Amelia had to admit the grandmaster was an exceptional <em>sensei</em>, far more skilled at tutoring than Serena was. Serena was great at identifying mistakes and slowly ironing them out, but this old demon was adjusting things at just the right time to prevent those mistakes from ever manifesting in the first place. Every instruction he gave came with decades of experience that Serena had yet to overcome.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjBmYzhjNzFhYjQ5Y2JhYmY1OTYzMGY0N2ExYmJl">They began sparring again, which really just consisted of Amelia defending against an assault with no opportunity to counter-attack. She could <em>perceive</em> what she thought were openings, but she had no idea how to manoeuvre her body in such a way to make use of them. This time, the attacks against her included the occasional thrust and after an unknown amount of time, Amelia started to feel confident in defending against them even as her body grew tired and sweat dripped down her face.</p>
<p class="cnM4YmFmNDk2Mzg4ZjQ2NmU4MWU2YTUwNmM3Y2VmNzMy">Serena had been right. The sword she held no longer felt very light.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTdkYTU3OWQ0NTQ3MjJiOTViYTQzYzk5NDhjMGMw">Again, another attack was thrown in that Amelia couldn’t defend against. Sometimes it was a new strike or a variation of an existing strike that somehow slipped by her guard. With each addition, they would stop, and the grandmaster would carefully explain how she should adjust to the new threat. After he was satisfied she understood his explanation they would continue sparring.</p>
<p class="cnM4NGE2ZGI4OTg0NTQxNmY5YTNmNDAyYzc3OWIyNmI4">Just as her confidence grew and she felt she was starting to piece things together, the grandmaster cloaked his body and weapon in red, the first aura. The speed and aggression suddenly increased drastically, and Amelia was only barely defending against each strike. Her blocks, which she felt had become controlled and firm, were now hastily formed one after another, only just fending off one strike before the next one came.</p>
<p class="cnNkMWNlOGFmYjk3NjRhYTE4YmFlOWNiMTlmZDdjOWVh">Her hands ached, and her shoulders felt weak. It wasn’t long before her guard collapsed, and the wooden blade was once again at her throat.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTUyY2NkMzdjNzQ4NDU5NmNkNzI3NWNhZDljMTJm">“Ha… Ha…” Amelia breathed heavily. For someone untrained, relying on base stats and cloaked wards, her body had held out for a long time, but it could do no more. Without healing herself or Speaking, her strength was all but spent until she rested.</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2ZmYjg3YzAzYzQ0NTk4YWUwY2MwY2QwYjhkY2I5">“That’s enough for today. Well done, Speaker Thornheart.” The grandmaster gave a neat bow, and Amelia reciprocated with her own, which was far more clumsy than she would have liked.</p>
<p class="cnMwMWU1ZmJlZTcyYjQ2MGM5N2YxOGI1YTQzZDQ3Yzli">“Ah… T-thank you. Now if you'll excuse me…” Amelia flopped onto the wooden floor. “I’m just going to have a little nap here…” She heard a familiar click of Serena’s tongue and could imagine the shaking head of disapproval, but she didn’t care. The blood pounded in her ears, and she tasted iron in her mouth.</p>
<p class="cnMwMThlNjMzZTAyZjRjYTg5OTg3NWQ4MTFkNWMwYzZh">She would ask Serena to give her a nice long massage later.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZWY0ZDJlMzk2MTRkYmFiZWZhYWU3ZjI3YTljYjJk">“What do you think, Grandmaster?” Amelia heard Serena ask.</p>
<p class="cnNhZWZkNjFmMmNiODRhMTU5ZTIzOTM1MTQyYzY2ZTI3">“Instructing Speakers is fundamentally different,” the grandmaster replied. “Their constitution, which they gain from just communing with the gods, allows them to train at a higher intensity for longer. This is the first time I’ve trained a Speaker mage…” he trailed off, and Amelia could sense the three of them had turned their heads in unison to look at her sprawled out on the floor. Well, let them look! She was busy resting.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjJlNzc5YzY0YTQ2NzNhMDFmMjgyYzRkOGMyNGY2">“I hope she is an anomaly, for if all human mages are capable of what she just went through, then I dread to think what their dedicated swordsmen can do.”</p>
<p class="cnM0OTgxMzZlMzIwNTQwZGY5ZmQyMWYwMGI3ZjFlZTEy">“Is she talented?” Aiden asked.</p>
<p class="cnMzOWI0NzA1ZTJiMjQ3YWY4YTdjY2Y4M2VmMzExZTRj">“Maybe. The concentration is excellent, although her etiquette needs some work…”</p>
<p class="cnNlMTA1NTVmYzNhZTQ5NDU4ZmE4NmFmNTliMjE1NDU2">“Working on that,” grumbled Serena.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTU0NTIzNWRjYjQ0NGY4MWM5Yjg4OTVkNGRiZjYw">“I train here every day. I start an hour before lunch. While the three of you are in Kenhoro, you should join me when you can. I’ll notify the front gate not to challenge any of you in the future.”</p>
<p class="cnM1N2I4MjY2ODJkYTRlY2RhNjNlNTZjMTU1MTNlMmNm">“It’s a generous offer,” Serena said, “I hope we’re not imposing.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYzA4YjcxN2ZhNzRiNzM4YjA3NjYwODNlOTg1MTli">“Not at all!” The grandmaster said cheerfully. “I myself have some questions regarding the sword I have struggled to answer for many years. Perhaps tutoring two talents like yourself will give me the insight I’ve been looking for!”</p>
<p class="cnMyY2VmODg3OWRiODQ4MzJhM2NkZTkyOTk0NzlhMTE2">“Thank you, Grandmaster.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMmE3NDJjMDdlYzRlMzViNjEzYjM2YzMxMjE2Nzhm">The trio of them chatted about various topics while Amelia had a power nap. In addition to her monstrous aether regeneration, she also had significant health regeneration that she suspected greatly improved her recovery from exercise and other stresses on her body. After a few minutes, she felt okay again and joined the group.</p>
<p class="cnNjMmFmOTUwMTEwNjQzOGE4NDY4NzU1MzRlZjQ3YzJi">With the grandmaster’s permission, he allowed both her and Serena to take a practice weapon so Amelia could refine what she was taught in her own time. He had been intrigued by Serena’s weapon, which was made of marble, so they recounted the events of the Highguard affair to him from their perspective.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDQ4ODc4NTBkYTQyYmY5YjdhM2NmM2ViNzA4NmQ4">“I only know Lord Yulan by name. I didn’t know he was a friend of House Halen,” said the grandmaster while standing up. “Still, it gladdens me to hear he has recovered from his affliction, thanks to Speaker Thornheart’s magical healing.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNjY1MmJlZDM0ZTQwZmE4NjliN2NjZmE3OWFhODI4">“Mmm, mmm!” Amelia said, nodding. “Would you like me to heal you? Serena said it healed her shoulder, which had been troubling her for years!”</p>
<p class="cnMwZDM4ZmQwOGQwZDRmZTJiY2YzYTgxZDZmNWUyNjk1">“Oh? You would offer such a service to an old-timer like me?”</p>
<p class="cnMyZGQxYTY2ODdkMzQyOWU4YWQ1MTZhNWFhZGUxMTlk">“Of course! Can’t have you keeling over on us mid-lesson, can we grandpa?” She flashed a cheeky grin. The old demon was only scary when he was instructing her. Outside of that he had an almost <em>homely</em> feel to him. Hopefully, Serena’s father was just as easygoing!</p>
<p class="cnMwMWU4YTc1ZmU2OTQzY2VhYjQ2OTU0MzEzOTVjMWIw">“If you wouldn’t mind…”</p>
<p class="cnNiZmZkMGNlODY1NzQxN2I4ZTM3MTBiOTFiOGE5Y2I5">“Sure!” Amelia twisted the aether inside her, forming the spell and spreading golden light with blue hues that flowed into the old demon’s body. She threw in a cleaning spell as an extra, ridding the demon of the small amount of sweat that had built up.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzY1ZDIwZTU0ODQ2OGQ4ZmFlNDFmOTJiYzBhMTdh">The grandmaster bathed in the light in an almost meditative state. He was silent for a long moment before a smile crept up on his face.</p>
<p class="cnNlOGVhN2Q4NmYxNTQyYzI4YjczNzM3NDU1OWMwNmFh">“Yes… this might be what I needed. It seems so clear now.” He gave a quick bow to the group. “I apologise, but I must continue my own training. Speaker Thornheart, may the fell gods be in your favour for your kindness in sharing this boon. Speaker Halen, Officer Aiden. Your company was a pleasure! Leave this old man and his sword now. I hope I’ll see you three tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDdhZDlhYjY1OTQ4N2NiZmRhOTlkZDA0MTM2NGMx">“Uh…” Serena started before gathering herself. “Yes, Grandmaster. Thank you for your instruction. Let’s go, you two.” The group of them left the training hall and navigated their way back through the building. Thankfully, Serena seemed to remember the way; otherwise, Amelia was sure she would have gotten lost and stumbled upon some lecture instead!</p>
<p class="cnM1OTAxOGVlNTMzNzQ3NmE5MTQwZDI4NGE5NzQzMmY4">“He seemed… eager,” Amelia said, thinking about the grandmaster's reaction.</p>
<p class="cnNkODRhMTFlNjk2YzQ0MDM5NDhlNTAwM2E4Y2VkZTRj">Serena shook her head, keeping her voice low. “You must understand how <em>above-average</em> your healing is. When you healed me once, it felt like all the wear and tear of years of war had left me. I felt young again, even though, you know… I am young.”</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2E1NmIyYzE0NDQ3YTY4NDU0NjZiZDQ5MWRkMjlk">“How old are you, anyway?” Amelia asked. She was twenty-five when she had her soul move into this new body, which she suspected was even younger.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDZhNmU1NmMzYzRhZmI4Njg3YjRmMmFlYzY3Mzk5">“I…” Serena suddenly looked away, blushing slightly. “Hrmph! Does it matter?”</p>
<p class="cnNhYzQwYzlmMWY2NTQ0MWU4NTQ1MGQ1NjI3NzQ0MzUx">Aiden leaned into the pair, his face contorted into a serious expression. “That’s the noise that a thirty-year-old demon makes after they leave their twenties, Speaker Thornheart.” The man tried to dodge Serena’s backhand but failed spectacularly and was soon nursing a swollen forehead.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDdiNWY2ODg5ZTRjYmNiYTA0MGFmYTU4ODhiMjIz">“Don’t you dare heal him, Amelia,” Serena commanded, her eyes still not meeting hers. “He deserved that.”</p>
<p class="cnM3M2E1YTlhZTQ3MTQ0OTZiMjVhNzhiOTg3ZjVjNzVm">“O-okay!”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDE4OTA2OWQwYTQzYzlhYmMyNjdhYjQ5Y2UxNmJk"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NWQzZjAwNGNlMTQzNGZiMzFjOWQxN2M2NGVmMjYw"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNhNmI2ZDIyY2U2OTRkNTJhOGM3OWY1ZDQwY2Y2ODhl">Serena bid Aiden goodbye, taking a last look to appreciate her handiwork on his forehead before taking Amelia on a walk to the nearby markets. Tsk! Men! Why were they always so tactless? Serena cast a side eye at her girlfriend, who was skipping along, humming to herself. Her age didn’t bother Amelia, did it? She was still young, right!?</p>
<p class="cnMyMGY2NGU2ZDZkOTQyNTBiNzkwYWYzN2YyODhlMTZk">Well, it was a question she would probably be too embarrassed ever to ask, so best to let it disappear from thought. Amelia’s smile made her want to smile, and the way the girl’s hand kept touching the wooden practice sword sheathed in her belt reminded her fondly of the enthusiasm with which she had entered the academy.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTdjZjViNzY3NjQzODBiM2E5YzRkMTA1ZTI0MTRh">“Whoa! What’s that!?” Amelia exclaimed, pointing to a towering fountain that took the form of a dozen stone waterbirds. From their long beaks, spouts of water poured into the fountain basin.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTdhNzBkODIzNzQ1NzM5M2EwM2Y1NTEyODYzNjY2">“Waterbirds,” Serena said. She joined Amelia at the fountain’s edge, where hundreds of coins could be seen shining in the water’s bottom. “Look, each one is an offering to the kami. Each one a prayer or a wish.” She was sure the authorities must periodically remove the coins as they would eventually fill the fountain.</p>
<p class="cnNlODY5NDlmMTk0MzQxMmZhYTBhMGQ1MTEzNTQ3Nzcy">“Can I have a coin? Please!?” Amelia looked at her, eyes pleading. Serena dug out a small denomination from her purse and watched Amelia flick it into the water.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTI2MDUyODlmNTQ2YmJhMDgxMTRmYjhjOTZkNGNk">“What did you wish for?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzllNWMzMzc5YTQ3Y2NhMTFiNDgzYzU3NDM4MmUy">“Secret!” Amelia raised a finger to her lips. “It’s between me and the kami!”</p>
<p class="cnNmZGMzYmFiN2ZlODRjM2FhMDVkNjY3NWIxNTgzNjA4">Serena rolled her eyes. “Come on,” she said. “Market’s over here.” Together they moved to the crowd of haggling and bartering demons. There were significantly more humans around, many even running their own stalls. It seemed any discrimination manifested less here in the outer ring.</p>
<p class="cnM0YmU5MWM1YjYyNDQ2ZmViMjYxMWViZTE0MWEwYjJj">Unlike the Central market, this one had far fewer luxury goods and instead was more focused on homeware and food. “Here,” Serena said, purchasing the pair of them a large fruit with a paper straw sticking out. She handed one to Amelia before sipping her own, enjoying the sweet taste.</p><span class="cjBmNmZhYTUzMmQzOTRhMzQ4MDEzZWI3Y2MyZGI1NGUy"><br/>This tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNhZjA0ZjQ0ZDhkZDRhOTZiOGU4M2Q2NDgwMThmMTAy">“What’s this?” Amelia asked, taking a sip. “It’s sugary!”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTM1Y2VmZjg2NTQyMDZhM2U3MTY4ZGFjMTg5ZTMy">“Of course, it’s sugary; don’t you recognise these?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNjNhOGMwZTcwMzRkYzhiZTI4OWQ1ZTkxN2Y3ZTk5">“No,” Amelia tilted her head, looking a little too adorable with the straw poking her lips. “Should I?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNDUxNzgzMzQ1YjQwNjBiN2JiMmRkNTlhN2E5N2U5">“Don’t you have sugar, where you come from?” Serena asked, keeping her voice a little quieter, although the noise of the crowd alleviated any real concerns of being overheard.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjBkYzlmZmNkZTQxNGY4NmYwNzA1ZGM3ZjgwMGRm">“Yeah… why?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YWJmNDE2Yzk3ODRmZjI5NmY1ZjQ2M2ZiNmJmZDFj">“Sugar comes from this, right?” Serena wriggled the fruit in her hand. “The sugarfruit?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNTg2MjVhZGNkYjQ4YmFhMTllYjc4MGI2ZWMzZjAz">“Um… our sugar came from sugarcanes.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMWY5ZTMxYmFlYTQ2NzU5MDgzOTVkMTA5OTdjNjhl">“Sugarcane? What does that look like?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NDI5MjUxNzY1YjQ2ZmE4MTAzYmY2ODViNmIxZWZl">“Like bamboo, I think. I remember reading about it at one point.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YTdhYzY5NDBjNDQ0MzlhZGQ4YzQxOWRlYjBjMWI1">“What a weird place you come from…” Serena muttered, trying to imagine how sugar could be meaningfully processed from a bamboo-like crop.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjkyMTQ2MmVlNTQxOGZiMDNkNWZjMjVlZDQ3Yzc5">“Says the person who lives on a <em>floating</em> <em>continent</em>…” mumbled Amelia as she sipped her sugarfruit. “Tastes nice, though!”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmVlMTFjMDJiYjRlOGVhZGVmOGQzNDAwODhmOGEx">“Moon crystal in the soil can affect the taste. Sugarfruit is grown across the Empire, except the very far north.” Serena took another sip from her straw. “The liquid can be drank and the insides eaten if you can be bothered to open it up. The outer shell makes good fodder for animals.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZWQ2ZTdlYjliMDQwMTY5MDlhYmUwN2JkODg5N2E3">“That’s so cool! Every bit can be used, leaving no waste.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDQ1Mjc2MDk5YjRjM2JhYjBkZjdkNTYxMDhhNjg0">Serena nodded. “I think Centralis can be more wasteful in their attitudes, but here in the East, it’s an important philosophy to use everything, whether it comes from a crop or an animal.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYjk1OTFmYTQ4MTRjNzRiODJlMjIwYzQzNTkxZmNi">“Mmm!” Amelia moaned, finishing her sugarfruit before darting off to a nearby stall. “Oh my! Buy two, please!” Serena couldn’t say no to the pleading eyes and handed the stall owner some coins. As they made their way along the crowd, Serena saw Amelia grinning wildly at her acquisition.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDgwYTM1ZTk0ZTQyNGM5NDJlNmFkZTViZWRiM2Rj">“I can’t believe you have toffee apples! I used to love eating these during festivals! Here, have one!” Amelia handed her one of the toffee apples, and they both disposed of their sugarfruits.</p>
<p class="cnM0OWEyN2EyNGZiMTQ4MzM5NDE0YWFiM2E0MmU0YWY2">“What kind of festivals did you have?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzRlYTIwNzQxMTRlOTE5OTZhOGRmZTA1NTRlZTJk">“Mmm…” Amelia raised a finger to her chin in thought. “We had <em>Halloween</em>, where everyone would dress up as scary monsters and ghosts, and we’d give the children sweets! Oh, and <em>everyone</em> celebrated <em>Christmas</em> every year, where we’d give and receive gifts with our families.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NzMxN2YxODhhNDQxMTM4MDQ0MDExZmVhZWI4YmM2">“Finally, something familiar,” Serena said, “We also celebrate <em>Christmas</em> yearly, both here and in the human territories.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTgzMjgwYTE0ZjRkZDhhZTVhODRmYjhkYWZlYjQ2">“You have that Demon Bible, right? Eventually, I’d like to read it and see how it differs from our own. What does your one say?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NGMzODMwNjAzMDQ5YjY4ZTkxN2Q0NTNmOGZiNTY5">“I’m not a religious scholar, but it basically details the story of Christ. How he came down in human form to aid the human race in their original realm and then, thousands of years later, took demon form and did the same to us.” Serena shrugged. “I prefer to focus on the gods I know, the Empress and <em>Narean</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYzhmNzhiZWNhZTQwMjhiMDdiNzQyMjc3YTNlZTQ0">“So interesting…” Amelia trailed off, seemingly lost in thought.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTIyMmYzMzU4MDQ1MDk4MzQ4MGRiYTRlMTAwMGU4">They perused the market for a half hour, occasionally trying out foods here and there. Amelia had a sweet tooth and was complaining about feeling sick at the end, prompting Serena to call her girlfriend once again an idiot.</p>
<p class="cnM4NjAwZDdkYTQ2OTQzMjQ5MzE5YjY4MjUxYWNjYzg0">It was a term of affection, really.</p>
<p class="cnNiOGYzNmQ0MDBiMDRhM2I4YjkwMjhhYTQxYzY3N2Fj">Together they took the tramlines back to the docks where Serena found Allston the chief engineer overseeing the repairs. Several dozen workers clambered across the deck, operating steam grinders and overhead cranes. The noise was loud and she hoped Anathor wouldn’t be too annoyed by it all.</p>
<p class="cnNmMWQ3NDlmMDM4OTRjY2JiNjVmNmE3MTJjOWE3Nzg2">“Allston,” she called as she approached the demon.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjM4ZTE3NzYzZDRmZTRhYzlmNDI3YjUwNzdhZGFi">“Ah, Captain!” He called before nodding to Amelia. “Miss Thornheart,” he said with respect. “We’re removing the patch job. Always slow work with the grinders, but the extra horns sent by the Greatlord should have us done in three weeks.” The engineer's voice lowered, only just audible over the sound of the tools and shouting workers. “You should have been here this morning, Captain. The Stormlord himself came down to look at the ship.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNjA4MGRhYWNmMjQ2OTc4NTYwNDY0ODQyMGJlZDJi">“Did he now?” Serena’s eyes narrowed. “Did he try and board?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNmYxYjA4ZGFiNTQyMTJhMTc4YjU1OTFlOTMzNGRh">“Didn’t have a chance to. <em>Shin Yu</em> came out and told him to piss off!”</p>
<p class="cnM0NDA2ZDNlNDE1NTQ4ZjViZjFhMmVkOGMzYjVkMjhh">“<em>What!?”</em></p>
<p class="cnM5NmY3YzA1MjU2MjQ0Y2FhMjg4NTRjNWIwMjM3Nzdi">“I know, right? We’re all there while the Greatlord is introducing us to his new workers and giving out commands. We’re all nervous, of course. You know what the Greatlords are like to be around…” Allston shook his head. “Then Shin Yu comes out of his office and starts berating the man like he’s… he’s…” The chief engineer waved his hands in frustration, “I don’t know! But he just starts yelling about how the Stormlord’s… you know…” Allston made popping noises and motions with his hand, “... energy he was giving off was messing with the docks instruments.”</p>
<p class="cnM4Yjg4OWVlYWUyODQxMWU4MDk2MGIwMjFmNGIwYWY4">“Fucking hell…” Serena mumbled. “What happened then?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjlmNTkyMTA5NzRmOTU5NDUyMWEzMTdjODY4NDQ5">“Well, by the time Shin Yu started threatening to write a letter to the <em>Overlord</em>, it looked like the Greatlord was going to vaporise him. I was saying my prayers, but Anathor piped up from the ship and somehow calmed everything down.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYjZmYmQ4MWU1YTRmNGVhNmZmOTljNjQ2Yzc4YjZh">“Where’s the dockmaster now?”</p>
<p class="cnNmZDFjYzc0OWZiNDQxNTJhZDMzZmZkMGNjZmJiOGNi">Allston shrugged. “Probably still in his office, writing that letter.” He chuckled, “Couldn’t believe it. That crazy guy has one hard set of horns.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDBmNzhkYWQ3ZDQzM2M5NjEzYjZhMjdiNmQyNDAz">“Tell me about it,” Serena said, “So, three weeks for the repairs. Anything from Thorne regarding a new turret?” They couldn’t just leave the turret pod open to the elements. If they couldn’t find a replacement, they would need to cover it with armour.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjM0YTZhMjZjOTRlMGViNDNjOGRiNWQ4ZDBjNmIw">“He’s working with one of the men the Greatlord brought with him. Apparently, there’s some stock hidden away for emergency repairs they’re making available. He should have a report on it soon, I think.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NTZkOWJhMzI1MjRhYTNiMzAzNzliNzU2YzdlOTMz">“Alright. Good work, Allston,” She patted the demon on the shoulder. “Make sure to give your men some breaks, alright?”</p>
<p class="cnMyM2RkN2I5ZjE3MzQ4MjQ5YjY4MzIzMmM0ZjM0OTAw">“Hrmph, alright…”</p>
<p class="cnNhYzI2NmEyYTE2YjQ0YWU5YWZkYTlhMWQ4MDVhZTg4">“I need to talk to Anathor about something. Come on, Amelia.”</p>
<p class="cnNmY2UzNDIyNmNiMjQ1MDFiZTFjMjNmYjZlYTMxZWY4">“Okay!” Amelia chirped, and the pair of them left the workers and headed deep into the ship. Even after closing the door to their quarters, the sounds of the steam grinders could be heard, their vibrations flowing through the ship's structure.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDZlN2M2MWY1NTRmNmZiMjk4NmIxMTMxM2MyMjgz">“Welcome back, Captain,” Anathor said, the moose’s eyes glowing softly.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzg4YTQwOTU4YzQzOTViOTRiYjlkNTg0OTE2MjBl">“Anathor, I’m still having this dream,” Serena began, detailing to Anathor the conversation she had with the grizzled human captain in the foggy dream world. It was hard to tell with the disembodied advisor, but when she described the man from her dreams, she was sure something had changed in Anathor’s behaviour.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGJmMjA0MTczYzRjMDc5ZGMxYTM5OWQ0ZGRiMDJm">“Hmm… I don’t think the ship’s talking directly to you, although I believe it shows you a memory.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZWViM2NiMzNiYzQ0N2FhNjg5NzkyNDg4OWI5OWFm">“A memory?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNzBhN2QyODM4MjRjYWM4NjgwNzUwOGJhZDliMWI3">“Something it witnessed. Very long ago.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMGE5MDg1YWZiMTQyNDg5Mzk1M2Q2YWNiZjVmZjA3">“Something's going on, isn’t it, Anathor?”</p>
<p class="cnMzNjY0YjgwMmE5OTQ2Y2Q5YTNlMjVlYWEyYmZiNTA4">“Hmm… remember I told you the ship was fundamentally damaged?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MjFkN2U0ZDRlMzRiODhiMjNmMzJmODY4OGM1MzNj">“Right, which is why we dip into the lumina every now and again.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYTYwZDY5ODAwODQwZjBiNzhmYWFlYzM5NGI5ZTJj">“I’m starting to sense… it’s becoming <em>less</em> damaged.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYjA2M2ZlZDQwYTQ2Nzk5YzRmM2M4YWQ1YjBjMmEy">“What does that mean? What will happen, Anathor?” Serena resisted the urge to click her tongue. Sometimes getting a clear answer out of him was more challenging than getting blood out of stone.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjM4MDMzZjQwYzRjYWI4NDFhMmRkZmE4ZjQzZTY0">“I… don’t know. I didn’t think this was possible. At least, not yet. I’ll need to think about this matter for a while, Captain. Apologies, but I cannot offer proper counsel just yet.”</p>
<p class="cnMxN2JhNWU0YjNlNzQyZDZhZmUxOWRiNTM4MmIzMTRi">Serena sighed.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2RkYWE3MGE2NzRmYzRiMmE2MDFjYWI0YjJjZTEx">“Just… give me answers when you have them. I’ve already got enough on my hands with this one.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZGY3YTQyNjNlMDQxODk4OGU0ZDU4NzA1ZTI4MTMy">“Hey!” Amelia protested, puffing her cheeks out. “Look what I have to deal with, Anathor! This harassment!”</p>
<p class="cnM4M2YxMWYyNjc0YjRlZTdiY2ZmMzQ2YmEzNDE1Y2Zi">“Hmm…”</p>
<p class="cnMwNmZiYzk0NjM0ZTQzZjNhN2RlZDg4NzA1Mjg0Njcx">“Let’s go, Amelia.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMDdiNDdlY2NmOTQ4N2Y4Y2JhZjQwZDdkODkxMTE3">“Where are we going?”</p>
<p class="cnM3OGY0NTVmNzllOTQ4YWE5NDc2Y2U5ODhhNWJlMWUx">“Back to the inn.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYTQ2ZTY5ZjNmMTQ5OGRhZGY0MGRkZTJiYzFkY2U1">“Oh! Okay!” A twinkle in Amelia’s eyes told Serena exactly what kind of thoughts had just gone through the human’s head. She couldn’t stop herself smiling.</p>
<p class="cnNhZGMyNDEwYTM4OTRkMGY4MDI2ZDY3ODI0MWJlYzM3">“Goodbye, Anathor.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ODczMTI2ZDhjMzRjZGM4MGJkNjk4ZDg1ZjAxZTY4">“Hmm…”</p>
<p class="cnMwMzE1MmM0MGRmMjQxYjc5MWFkZGJlOGY3MmFkYzdl">Serena left him to his thoughts and took her girlfriend back to the inn. As they got closer, inappropriate thoughts kept creeping ever more to the forefront of her mind, and by the time they arrived at the door to the room, they were both so flushed that they only just managed to get inside before throwing themselves at each other.</p>
<p class="cnNmZmQwOTdjYmM3MDRhNDdhOTBhMTZkMGY0ODhkMzc5"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ODg2NWQzYWRiMjQzODM4NjNlYjIyYjM5MTVkZDAy"><img alt="New Scene - Elana POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/elana.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWE3MDYxOWFjYzQ3MTFiNTE1NDQxNDM5OWRlNTgw">By most people’s standards, the small office could be considered modest. Its extravagance paled in comparison to the rooms of most Cascadian Lords, although none would dare raise any objections over the simple decor. The wooden floor and furniture were primarily functional, with a bit of flair to give the room some character. On one wall was a map of the Cascadian Empire and on the other a woven tapestry depicted old memories long since forgotten by most.</p>
<p class="cnM3MGM0NGMxY2I0ZTRmMGU5NTA1NGY5YWFmYzBkODhj">At one end of the room, a sturdy desk stood upon which a small pile of documents stood, weighted down by a human skull. A half-full teacup delicately held in the hands of a woman with golden hair and blue eyes gave off the subtle scent of mint tea.</p>
<p class="cnM2NzUzNjFhMzY3YzQ2ODg4MTk3NTI4ZjQzYWRhNGE5">Upon her head, two very small horns sat.</p>
<p class="cnM0YmJhNTQ3MjUyNTQwMDlhYzg0NzlmZWZmYWIxMzll">She sipped the tea while pondering how to word her reply to the letter from the West. The Overlord in command of that territory had sent a rare correspondence, raising a troubling matter that was another piece in a growing set of problems the Empire faced.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTEyMjkxMGViYzQ3NjJiODU2MTUxNzVkZjBjNzI2">A set of problems she was starting to suspect were linked.</p>
<p class="cnNiNTBkMmUyMGJmNTRmOGViYzNmZWE2OWJlYzI1MTA4">After settling on a wording that she felt communicated her thoughts on the matter appropriately, the young-looking woman scratched her reply onto the paper with a quill before gently inserting it into an envelope and using magic to melt some wax upon it. She pressed the stamp into the wax, leaving an imprint of a single letter that was written in the language of the Words.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDY2MzhlMmZhODRmMzNhMjg4Y2Y4ZDE4NzlhMzRl"><em>E</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM0Yjg5MjVlZWFiYzRjODQ4MGEwMmIzZGFlMzViNDgy">Placing it to the side, she lifted the skull and removed the next document that required her attention. It was a letter written in shining red ink on ash-coloured paper. Paper that was almost priceless, for it was sourced from the holy trees that only grew in the higher circles of hell. Looking at its author, she saw it was a message transcribed by her ambassador to the Upper Halls. The poor man had been dragged into a rather uncomfortable meeting with the higher gods and given a dressing down.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGEyMWQzN2JhMzQ2ZmFiOTVkMGI1MGZkZWRlMTY4">She allowed the smallest of sighs as she read the letter’s contents. It was essentially a noise complaint regarding the events that transpired in the Lower Halls a week ago. The language used was aggressive, demanding an explanation. It <em>strongly</em> implied that without one, they could consider the event an act of war against the Seven Hells as it had originated from her territory.</p>
<p class="cnNkMGE4YjgyYTBmYjRhYTk4Nzc1YjUyMjY4OTk1NzEx">The woman took a few breaths to think. The Hellords had been diplomatic in their wording not to demand it, but reading between the lines, they clearly expected her to cross realms and offer an explanation in person.</p>
<p class="cnM0NDM5YmRhZjJjMzQxNTVhZDg4MWQ1MzdhM2ExMWRj">Whilst thinking about this, the woman decided the mint tea was wholly unsuitable for the mood.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTlhNWQzMGY3NjQ2ODhiZjM4N2JkODAwYjAzNjA2">“Theresa,” she called.</p>
<p class="cnMzMGFjOWVkYWVhMzQ5NmM4MmI3ODIzNjcyZDYyYWM0">With a crack, the maid snapped into the realm, appearing from thin air beside the woman. It was a skill that would frighten even the Greatlords, if they even knew what the ability truly implied.</p>
<p class="cnNiOGY4ODg0ZDNhYzQyZTc4MGFiODQ1ZGI5YjViNTlk">“Divine One?”</p>
<p class="cnNmYTlkYzdlYzQwNzRkYThiYzQ5MzU2MzY4Y2Y3OTU2">“I-” She was cut off. “Something's approaching. Fast.” A slight frown appeared on her forehead as she identified the anomaly. “Ah. This will be a private conversation. Make yourself scarce, Theresa.”</p>
<p class="cnNkM2Y2N2NjNzRmNjQxNjc5YTA1YzYyMjliZmMwMjc0">After a moment of concentration, the maid shifted into another plane of reality, leaving behind the telltale sign of a hurried realmshift; the smell of burnt toast. The woman relaxed, sipping her mint tea while the anomaly swept into her office, ruffling the papers and causing a pleasant breeze.</p>
<p class="cnNjZmVhMWY4YWQzZDQ0ZTBhMDM0OTcxMDRjNDMwODJh">A second passed, and the atmosphere died down. The hollow eyes of the skull glowed with a familiar crimson hue.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjk2YTYwZDg3MDQ1YjZhNjRkYzgzMGI2NGI1YmU0">“Hail, Empress Elana of Cascadia! Shard of Infinity! Overlord of Overlords! A-” The skull suddenly cut off its salutations. “Am I being used as a paperweight?” It asked, its gruff voice suddenly taking on a tone of annoyance.</p>
<p class="cnM3YmY2ZGYzM2IzMjQ2YWE5MDY1NjVmNGE4YzQ3ZGUw">“If I had known you were coming, I would have placed you somewhere more suitable, Anathor,” Elana said. She gave the frustrated skull a small smile and took a slow, deliberate sip of tea. “I wish I could say I enjoy these rare moments you leave the ship. Unfortunately, you always seem to bring bad news when you do.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMWJmNDk2MTc0NDRjY2ViOTA5YjZmYjI5NmI3YmU2">“Hmm…”</p>
<p class="cnNjY2E5Yjc5YzZhMjQ5NzI4ZDc0NWEyNGM5YjhkYmZk">“What troubles, then?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNDIzNzVjODc1YTQxMzRhMjY2Y2NiNjg3NTQ1MWM3">“She is waking up. I am certain of this.”</p>
<p class="cnMyZDIxYjgxZWVlYjRjYjc4YmFmNzk3OTRkOGZlMDQ5">Elana closed her eyes. A feeling of ancient guilt and a touch of sadness filled her heart. “How? It shouldn’t be happening so soon.”</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2E4NWNiYTM2NTQ4ODA5ZjU5OGRmZjEwMjgwN2M1">“The human cast a healing spell. It has seeped into those torn and broken pieces of her and brought them a little closer together.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYjM0NDVlMTliODQ2NzJiZjU2MDJiN2NmZTU4MDNi">“The human…” Elana murmured, her eyes flicking to the ash-coloured paper on the desk. “Tell me about the human, Anathor.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMjQzYmE2ZTVjZDQwNzE4OTI1YWU0YWFmMjZjNzQ0">“Hmm… I did not notice it until now, but the pair of you look similar.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNTQ2YjAwY2M0NjQ1MGNiZmE3MDk5YzhjYzk1ZWQx">“In what way?"</p>
<p class="cnM3NWUxYWMzNmMxNzQzYzA5ZWM2YzM1YjY0YmEwNWRk">“Blonde hair, blue eyes,” The skull’s red eyes flashed, “Both hiding another form…”</p>
<p class="cnNiMzQ3ZjAxODcyYjRmZTk4ZTI5NDVmYWFhOTRlMDA4">Elana was silent for a moment. “Anything else?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjcwOTJmZWVkNTQ0NzE5MGM5YThiZDc3M2Y3ZjE3">“She has bonded with the captain.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZmM2Nzg5YjFiYTQ3YjJhYmYwOThiMDIzMTc0M2Zj">“Bonded?”</p>
<p class="cnNkY2FmZjBmYTY0NTQxOTA4MmVlMjU1Y2NiMzNmMzBm">“Yes. I sense it in them both. A growing infatuation. It will eventually turn into love.”</p>
<p class="cnNiODQ2ZjU1N2ZiMzQzZjU5YWE1ZjY5Y2Q2M2MzMTdm">“Oh?” Elana intoned, sipping the last of the bitter mint tea before swallowing audibly. “How sweet. I’m jealous, truly. I must find time to meet the human and this captain.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MjRhYjQ0Zjk5MTQ3ZWNiNWQ0Y2Y3YTc3OTE1OGYx">“To what end, Princess Elana?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTI0NTA5YTVjYTQyODdiNTM3NTg3YTE5NzQ0YmYz">Elana raised an eyebrow. She decided against chastising the formless, for his comment had raised an authentic smile upon her lips. For that alone, he could be forgiven. “Princess?” She asked the skull.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzhhNjU2ZTliODRmZjU4MDEyZDNjZTMwYjQ2MjMy">“So many centuries have passed, but you are still that same brazen princess I remember. Charging into the enemy, waving that flaming spear.” The gruff voice softened, and memories she had thought she had forgotten sprang up in her mind. “I remember now. I lectured you for your recklessness. Ha!”</p>
<p class="cnM5N2VmM2RlYzE1MjRjM2E4OWYwOTVmNGZjZTM1NzI2">“So long ago…” She murmured.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTc5ZWJhODU2OTRlZmE5MTMxNjI1ZDExZjc5OWFh">“So long ago,” echoed Anathor.</p>
<p class="cnNhZWNkMzVkMzM1NTQ5NDE5NTUyMDIxZjY3NzE1YjFl">“Sometimes I still feel like I’m eighteen, you know? I thought I would grow to despise my long life, but as the centuries tick by…” She turned her head and stared directly into the skull's glowing eyes. “I find myself loving it more every day. How about you, my mentor?”</p>
<p class="cnNkZmYwYTE3YTIwODQwZGViZmE0ZDY2NzBhNmU2YTRm">“Hmm… I haven’t given it much thought… You don’t think much of these things when you don’t have a body.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMDdkNDY2MjM1NjQ1ODZiNzc5MjQ4NTc0OWU3NzFj">“Would you like me to make you one?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YjBhMzBiMDkxYzRkZTU5NWIwMTJjMzczM2Q4MzA3">At her offer, the skull was silent for a long time. “Perhaps…” Anathor eventually said, “...Perhaps after my duty is done. Then I may request such a thing. If you are willing.”</p>
<p class="cnNlOTFhOGIxZjM5ZTRmN2VhODBkYTFkYjM4MTMwNThm">“Of course,” Elana said, feeling a tinge of empathy at the long-suffering plight her mentor’s duty had caused him. “What will you do if that comes to pass?”</p>
<p class="cnNhOWI2NTFmNDUwODRmZDdiY2I4ZjE2MWM3MjRhZTgx">“Hmm… I would go home.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDIzZTA1NDNmMDQ2MTZiOGVlYjBiNDdhYWU3YmM4">“You’re a long way from home, Anathor.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNzg3OTE3ZWViNTQ0MTZhOWFiYjI2NmVhNDMxNzY3">“So very far…”</p>
<p class="cnM4ODExYjEzMDEwZDQ0YTc4Zjc3YjRlZDcwNDRmNGVi">The two of them fell into a lull of silence and self-reflection. Many memories flashed through Elana’s mind, and she was sure Anathor was having his own period of reflection. Eventually, the skull’s red eyes flashed as Anathor broke the silence.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzI1NDM5MzVjODRiNmNhZmNlN2M1NGI4MDgzYjk0">“Are your shackles still holding firm?”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDllNDg4MmNkMDRkMjk4YTJhNTNiZWUyYmZkNmNj">“... Yes,” Elana whispered.</p>
<p class="cnNhN2U3YjBkZjE3YzRkMGViNGIwZGU3ZWE0YTg3MmE4">“Our punishments were deserved.”</p>
<p class="cnNmOTA4MjIzMjhjNzRmMThhNzY0MDM5YzBiNGZmZjg2">“I know.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYjRjNDU4ZGY5NTRlZDJiZTIzMzQ5OGZmYzczMmY0">“It was a terrible thing we did. A great sin.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOWVmOGYyZTE3NjRiOWRhNjkzMjQ2NmI5YzQ1NDA5">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NTNhZjVlYzM0YzQ0YTc5ODEzZDhmZjQ2YzY1Njgy">“A cardinal sin.”</p>
<p class="cnNiZjA1MzZlM2Y2MDQ4MDRiNjE1YzY4MWYxYjBmNDU4">“Damn it, Anathor. Why are you bringing it up now?” She gave the formless a pointed stare. He always knew how to drive a point home. “The human, how powerful do you think she is?” She asked, forcefully changing to a less sombre subject.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTVmN2ExODQ4NjQwNzE4MWIzMWRkNTZkNmQ1YmIx">“Hmm… as with you, I sense no upper boundary to the powers she can draw.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYTk3NDdkZTVmNjRhZjg4YzZiODJmZTQzNzAyNDc1">“Is she experienced?”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDMyNGE4ZTMxMjQyZDI4ODEzMjU4MTIxMTc1MTdm">“... No.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDcwOThjMTlhZTQ3NWE5YjQ3ZTlhYmUxOTI1NmJk">Elana sighed, taking a sip from the cup before remembering too late that no tea remained. Nevertheless, she kept the act up, pretending to drink politely as she organised her thoughts.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjk3NGRkOTI2NzQ1NmNhN2VmMzc3M2JmMzhmNDYx">“Where do you think she came from?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZWE3ODk4ZTlmOTQzN2ZiZDhkODVkNDhkMTVjMjZh">“The deepest depths of the Sixth Heaven. The souls there merged into something by chance and created her. Not knowing what to do, the Heavens placed the soul in a vessel and threw her into the mists where she stumbled upon our realm.”</p>
<p class="cnMyZjE5NTM1NWQwOTRhNDRhZjVlOTlmYWZlNGE2YzIx">She considered the possibility before mentally filing it away for further consideration later. “If the ship’s waking up, then we have no choice, Anathor. We must find what was lost.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YjgxZTVmYmYxMDRkYmQ5NzEyMDI3NjIzNGQwMTVm">“How?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMzM5ODkwZGY3NDQyMmI5N2NkNjlmZGZiNmViOTBi">“... I’ll think about it.” She placed the cup delicately back down. “Go now, Anathor. You know how uncomfortable she becomes when you’re not there.”</p>
<p class="cnMzM2U3ZjVlNzgzMjRiNjJhODQ5MDFhYzNhMmQxODFh">“... Goodbye, Princess.” The red eyes faded, and the formless began its flight back to the East, leaving only the noise of rustling papers.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTg1OWFkMmI1MzRjNDViNWVlYTNhNDE4N2M2NmI1">“Goodbye, Anathor,” she whispered, losing herself in her thoughts.</p>

      <description>Chapter Twenty-Four: Breaking Boundaries</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNhMTZjZDcxYjlhZTRlMGU5Zjk0MDY3M2RhNTFmZjRl"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM1YTcwNzgyN2M4ZDRhOGZhMzMwOTUwYzIwY2Q0ODBl">The week building up to the festival was a blur of activities, new experiences and satisfying bedtime exercises that were slowly becoming increasingly risque. As they became more comfortable with each other's bodies, Amelia felt their connection grow. When they were alone, she would sometimes sit on Serena's lap, interrupting her work. While the demon would click her tongue and roll her eyes, Serena would still embrace and kiss her before complaining about being distracted from her paperwork.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDQyZDZlMjkwMzQxYWZhNTNmOGFkYTg4MWE0Njdi">They kept up the appearance with the futon but otherwise cuddled each other to sleep. Serena seemed to like it when Amelia buried her head into her chest, so that became their typical sleeping position. They would talk about each other's lives and hold as little back as possible. Serena couldn’t share everything as she was a commissioned officer, and so some things needed to remain secret.</p>
<p class="cnNiYjkzMGJhOWNkMzRkYjU5ODUwYmYzZDRhMjJhM2Y2">“I suppose there’s one thing I’ve been wondering…” Serena mumbled one night while Amelia was nestled into her chest. Amelia readjusted her position so she could look into the pair of crimson eyes. She had learned that when Serena mumbled like this, it was because she wanted to ask something that was troubling her.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDQxNDU0YWE3YTQ5OTA4MWVhYTk3MjA2YWM3YWQ1">“Wondering about what?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZTA4NTQ0MzQ5MDQ0MjE4MmQyODYzZTExYTY5Njgw">“What did you look like in your original body?”</p>
<p class="cnMxN2M4ZTQ4MTJmOTQ1MzNiMTc0ZTA5NDAzNzI5YTdj">Ah. Amelia could see why that was a difficult question to ask. She supposed it made sense. Serena knew she was in a new body, and curiosity was only natural. Her original body was her authentic self, and she was still getting used to it. At times she felt a little strange, especially when she looked at herself in the mirror, but those feelings faded as the days passed.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjc1YWUzMzJiYTQ5ZDRhYWE3YjMzZjc1NGE0OTIx">“I was a few inches shorter, and I had brown hair. Don’t worry, I wasn’t an old man or anything!” Amelia gave her girlfriend a reassuring smile. “I had blue eyes, but they weren’t as blue as these ones. Umm… I modelled the face after my own but made my features a little more sharp. Made my nose a little cuter as well!”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzkzOGJjMGViOTRjYTQ5M2VhNWU0NGUyNDkzZTA3">“So you looked similar?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNTM0NGQ4ZGYyMzQ3MjQ4OWY5Yjg4OGEzYTdiZjM1">“Yeah! I imagined her as an adorable little sister when I made this body! I think I was pretty average in looks where I came from, but the chronic disease often had me looking gaunt, so…” Amelia shrugged, “I hope you don’t think you’re being deceived or anything like that.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZGRlMzY5MDhiYzQ5MzFiMjM5Y2ViYjc2NzY3ZmVi">“No, of course not,” Serena said, pulling Amelia closer and giving her a kiss on the forehead. “I was just wondering.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OTExYzZiMjAwYzQ4ZGQ4OTFkMGFkYmFiNTQxYmU4">On occasion, Serena would ask a question about the game Amelia played. These conversations didn’t bear much fruit as so little of the game’s world reflected the reality she was now in. One theory they had was the game was designed by someone who had lived or visited this realm, but that didn’t explain how she had gained her character's abilities.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGYzOWQxY2I3ZjRlMmJhMThlMTI5NWIyY2M5YWQy">The most difficult thing to communicate was the neurolink device through which the game was played. After eventually getting the concept across, Serena asked if such technology could be recreated in Cascadia. After thinking about it, Amelia figured it would take many centuries of enormous investment to get even slightly close, even knowing the end product.</p>
<p class="cnMzMDMwNjdjMDU3YTQ2NjU4NmY0YWI2YmIwZDE1YzA5">Besides, the noise interference of atmospheric aether and the lumina would tremendously complicate computer chip development. Apparently, despite the ethereal substance manifesting as literal <em>magic</em>, mathematicians modelled much of its behaviour and interactions. Amelia was looking forward to meeting Serena’s genius sister Nina and asking her about it.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDQ5NzQzYTc2NDRiYTRhOTRkNGIzNmQzMGVlNGRi">Tomes started visiting them for a few hours every morning, during which time he would tutor her in the Imperial script. The first time he met them at the inn, he was carrying a bundle of books in his hands. He only briefly glanced at the futon before settling the collection on the desk.</p>
<p class="cnMxNTgxN2M4OWViMTRmMjE4OWFmYzRkMzJmMjFkNTY3">“Seven hells, these bring back memories,” Serena said, picking one up and flipping through the brightly coloured books.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDRhZWIyZWZlMzRiN2FiYzZkNmQyOWI3YjMxNTkz">“Are these… children’s books?” Amelia asked, flicking through the books with more pictures than words.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjcxMjcxMmNjOTQ0YmFiMTg3MDkyYzFiMTUzMmVj">“That’s right. I raided a book market for these. Half a denarii for the lot!” Tomes said, looking proud of himself. “They’re all Imperial, although they seem to focus on Manwese fables and stories. Loads of them seem to be about the kami.” He dug into the books and pulled out a red one with numbers on the cover. “Look here, elementary mathematics for demons aged uh…” He squinted at the back of the book, “Five to six!”</p>
<p class="cnMxNTU2ZWQ3NzU5NTQxN2VhMzJkNDNkZjA0YzdiZjEx">Amelia rolled her eyes. “Tomes, I know how to calculate the orbits of planets. I just need to figure out the symbols for different things.” She flicked through one of the maths books, seeing that she could do all this quickly with her limited knowledge of Imperial numbers. “Can you get something more challenging?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YmRlODVmMWNiODRiMjA4OTgyMTZiMWE4OTcxOGZl">“Alright then…” Tomes grumbled. “I’ll see what I can find for tomorrow."</p>
<p class="cnMzZWExYmNhNTg1MDRhM2E5Mzk2ZmYzYzJmYzg5OTQy">After that, they sat down and Tomes took her through the twenty-eight letters of the Imperial alphabet. She was sure she just needed to sound out the letters a few times and practice with simple words before it would all fall into place. By the end of the hour, she could already make decent attempts to pronounce the three and four letters that Tomes had written down.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjE1YTI1MmM0ODQ0MDc4MTA3OWE2ZWViNDBiNTM5">After Tome’s lessons, Amelia and Serena would take an early lunch and make their way to the academy, where they would train alongside the instruction of Grandmaster Gu. Amelia was introduced to the full suite of what was deemed ‘basic strikes’ as well as a number of new katas to practice.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWJlMWJhMDY4NjRjNDI5Mzk5ZGVlY2M5MjdhM2I3">Half the time was spent teaching Amelia, but for the second half, she was left alone to focus on her individual training while Grandmaster Gu instructed Serena. Unlike her training, which involved a lot of movement and sparring, Serena seemed to spend a long time <em>meditating</em> with her sword under the grandmaster’s instruction.</p>
<p class="cnMxODgyZGE1NzI2ODQ3NGU4NDAwODRmNDk5NTVmZDY1">Aiden would be there, although he didn’t train and preferred to watch and chat. “When did you leave Karligard to go travelling?” He asked one time they sat down to eat the bland buns.</p>
<p class="cnM4NTdjMmEzZjRiYTQyYWQ5OTk2MzZjYTgwMzMyNWQz">“When I was sixteen,” Amelia said, blowing on her hot bun, “After I realised I could keep myself in good condition from healing… I just set out and walked, you know? Sometimes I didn’t eat for weeks, but my magic kept me going.”</p>
<p class="cnNiM2FkN2I1NzNjZjQzYmU4MzQ0MWYwNjk0YjkyMGI5">“Did you sell your services?”</p>
<p class="cnNkN2Q4MDZlNDBmZjQ1ZjNiYzY5ZmNiMTg2ZmNiNjU2">“No,” she shook her head, repeating the story she had gone over dozens of times with Serena. “I avoided cities and only healed any injuries I came across. Never stayed around for long. I knew the church would want me, and I didn’t want the bother so…” she shrugged, “I just kept wandering.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNmQ5ZjE1OTlkNzRmMTU5NGIwOGM2MzZlYmQxYmQ3">“Until you met Captain Halen?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmRlZjk0N2JhZjQ2ZDhiODJmMTU4NGQ5OGM4ZWM2">“Until I met Captain Halen,” she echoed.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWVkY2E3ZWEwMTQwOTdhMDA0OTAxMTBjODEyZWM3">“And how-”</p>
<p class="cnMzN2U2M2QyYjY0NDQ1NTdiNmQ1ODEwODZiMDkwY2Qy">“That’s enough, Aiden,” Serena interjected, looking nonchalant as she nibbled her food. “You’re here for a profile, nothing more. I’m satisfied with her past, and that’s what matters. Her secrets are hers to keep and share as she pleases.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZmFlZDgwNWFlZDQ0NDQ5MGVkYmI1MzdmN2UxOWY2">“Officer Aiden,” the grandmaster grumbled, “Although I don’t attend their events much, I still am a Cascadian lord.” The old demon pulled out a letter and handed it to Aiden. “A recommendation from me for you to attach to your report. I can vouch for the good character of Speaker Thornheart.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTkyNTQ1ZWI0NzRjNTc5NWEyZDg5M2U4YWY2NzA0">Aiden took the letter, eyeing the grandmaster with a puzzled expression on his face. “You’ve only known her for a few days,” he said.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTA5ZGI1NWY2YzQzYzc5N2U4MDQ2NmYxZWQwZGE4">“True, but through our swordplay, I have seen enough of Speaker Thornheart’s soul to make my judgement.” The grandmaster gave her a grandfatherly smile. “She has done much for me already, so I am merely repaying the favour.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMWZlMGVjZTFkMjQ4Y2U4MWI4OWIwYWU3ZmQ0OWQx">What a kind grandpa! Amelia had to rub her eyes before tears could form. “Thanks grandpa! You’re amazing!” She beamed a smile at him, causing the man to rub his beard awkwardly and mumble something about a granddaughter.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDk4YzBiYzJiZDQwZmViZGQ1MmUzODM1ZDg4ZGQw">After their daily training, Amelia would cast a cleaning spell on all of them and then they would explore some part of the city. Sometimes Aiden joined them, and sometimes not. On occasion, she would be stopped by a random guard who caught sight of her blonde hair. At first, a quick word from Serena would sort the situation and they’d be on their way. After a few days, they stopped approaching her at all. It seemed someone high up had distributed her description with instructions to leave her alone.</p><span class="cjg5NTQ2ZjI4MTMzMjRmODE5ODY5NzY0M2NlOGJhZmJj"><br/>This narrative has been purloined without the author's approval. Report any appearances on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMzZWNkZGMyNTVkZTRkMGRiNDFjZmRlNTljYzZmNjYx">Serena took her to one of the pagoda temples, where the pair of them were encouraged to light incense sticks sticking out the mouths of statues of kami. Serena told her they were luck kami. They looked like funny imps from Amelia’s point of view.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjFmNDRlM2QyMDQ4ZWVhMjExZDIzYWEwYjdlOTEx">“How many types of kami are there?” She asked.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzAzNWYxZTMzMDQyNWViMWI0ZGNkYjhhMDUwMmVj">“Infinite, I suppose,” answered Serena. “Quinto teaches that everything has a kami within them, even a stone.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NGVhY2ZhNTg4MzQwMjA5ZTdkMmQwZjg3NjhjYTc0">“Even people?”</p>
<p class="cnNiYzIyMGE2Nzk4YzRlMzI5YTVjNGRjNzEwM2IyNzc3">“Sure. As far as they’re concerned, the demon soul is a kami,” Serena frowned, a thoughtful expression on her face. “Or the human one, as well. I guess that makes us all secretly kami taking on different forms.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMjA2ZmNhOWU5NTRjNzU4ZjgwZmRjYjk3Zjc2MGE2">“Well, I don’t feel like a kami!” Amelia declared.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjhmNzNhMmVhNDQ0OWNiMDc2MzVjMjc5MTk0NmIw">“What do you feel like, then?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTNkYTNiNzE5YzRiZjViOWI2YjEzMGM5ZjgzMmRj">“Your maid!”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjNjNGEwMWRhNjQ5ZTlhYzU4NzAzZGNmMGQwNDQ5">“Shut up.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNjMzMjNhMWI2ZTQ2N2ZiZjE4NzU2MjA3OTEwMTU1">Another time, Amelia was delighted to find a pet shop and inside discovered a whole range of fantasy creatures that all looked fluffy and adorable. Although she realised that these were just considered normal animals in Cascadia.</p>
<p class="cnM3NzUxZDZlMjUzZDRjODQ4ZjczOWQyZDU0NTM1ODQz">“Oh, my! Look at you! Serena! Look how cute it looks!” She dragged Serena to an enclosure where a small feline animal with large eyes and two fluffy trails was mewing at her through its confinement. “What is it!? It wants me to stroke it, doesn’t it!?”</p>
<p class="cnNkYWRlZDQwYmMwNzQ3MjY4NmU0YTY0YjYyYWYxNTI3">“It’s a <em>peeka</em>. They’re domesticated felines,” Serena said with an amused expression. Seeing Amelia so enthralled by every animal must have been entertaining to her. “They’re very friendly, very uh… <em>licky</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNhY2RmODA1ZTBmNzRjMzBiZjQxMzViYmU3ZGUwOTQ1">“I have to hold it, or I’m going to die!” Amelia announced with determination. She hunted down a nearby demon worker and bullied the poor girl into opening the cage. She held the cat-like animal, and the moment it was in her arms it started purring with a deep satisfying rumble as it rubbed its neck all over her and tried to lick her to death.</p>
<p class="cnNlNmIzNTBlM2EwMTRhMmM5OGJmNTk2MTA5MGZkZjlk">“Can-”</p>
<p class="cnNkMzI5YmU0MGIyMzQyMTk4NGE4NmZlNzAwNWZjODAz">“No,” Serena said. “No animals allowed on the ship.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYzA5NTc5MDEyMDQyMmI4MzFlYWMzOTY2OTQ3NTk1">“But-”</p>
<p class="cnMwZjBmYzcxYzcxOTRmZmZiODc2ODkxYTkwNGIxMzg2">“We have <em>peekas</em> at our home estate. My younger sister likes them. You can have your fill when we visit.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMmIxYzE5ZTFjZDQ1OWE5MTRhZWJiZTgxMGNjYzk5">“... Fine.” Amelia cuddled the animal with as much love as she could muster. She went to put the animal back, but Serena stopped her and gave it a few scratches. Her demon girlfriend really was a big softy, wasn’t she?</p>
<p class="cnNiNGFhNGQ4MmZiZDQ1YTE4MmQzYzBjZmM4M2E0ZWM2">On the third day, Lord Yulan appeared at the inn. They caught up over coffee and biscuits. Apparently, he had been given the all-clear to re-open the Highguard for business, but it wouldn’t happen immediately as he had to hire loads of new staff.</p>
<p class="cnNjNDZkODJmNDZlZDQ3YzE4NDdlODYxOTY2MmQ3ZTg2">“Not only that,” Lord Yulan said in hushed tones, “The <em>Crimson Reapers</em> were raiding the smuggler ships for weapons and dust and using the hotel to distribute the loot to their customers. But get this; apparently, they came across something they shouldn’t have. Something <em>really</em> valuable.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZDFiMmJhNTJhNDQ5ZDU4NWQ2ZmM5NGQ4ODNhOWUy">“Like what?” Amelia asked, the mystery tingling her curiosity.</p>
<p class="cnM1N2RmYjQ5MDM4ZDRhM2Y4NDdhOGYyZjJjN2Q0MTYz">“Who knows? Something valuable enough for two Speakers to defend it,” Lord Yulan shrugged, “My contacts in the guard said some big shots who work directly under the Greatlord came down and removed one particular crate from the loot the city guard had in their possession. It has something to do with crystals, but it isn’t dust. Apparently, it got shipped back to Centralis with an armed escort.”</p>
<p class="cnM5OWVmNTZiZjY1NDQzOWFhYzc2ZTA4NjA2MmZkNjg0">“Must be important for them to send an escort,” Serena said, taking a sip of her coffee.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDIzMjRiMTkyMDQ2OGU4M2VhNjAwYjA2Y2ZkM2E4">“Important enough for the Greatlord to <em>personally</em> escort it himself.”</p>
<p class="cnNhM2YxYjlmZjc3ZjQ2ZDI4MWRlMDA5NjcxZmIwZTI2">“He did? He’s left Kenhoro?” Serena’s eyes went wide in surprise.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTU2NDU0YzNiNTRkZGE4ZjhmN2FiNDhlYThjNmVl">“That’s what my contact says. There were lots of encrypted communications going back and forth between Centralis and here, starting when the crate was seized. Whatever it is, someone very important wants it.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTNhMDk4OGIzODRiYjE4NmE2YTBkYjdkMzc4OGJl">“Sounds like your nephew got in way over his head. What’s going to happen to him?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MWEyNTc2YWJhNzQ1MWNiNGE0YTZiZGY2YjBhNTRm">“He’ll be hung,” Lord Yulan said, his face suddenly looking solemn. “If his only crime was his poisoning of me, then I might have had an opportunity to ask for his sentence to be reduced…” The old demon sighed, sadness filling his eyes. “But this smuggling business... Of drugs and weapons during a war? They’ll hang him for sure. He’s on his way to Centralis, along with the captured mercenaries. I imagine they’ll want their statements in person.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNTNiNTYzNWNiODQxMjY5YTJlNWE4MDNhNGE0NTNm">“I’m sorry it came to this, old man,” Serena said as she squeezed her hand.</p>
<p class="cnMwMmQ3YmEwOTNjNjQzODBiNzU2ZDFjMDU3NzE3NTA2">“It’s okay, really,” Lord Yulan muttered, taking out a handkerchief and wiping his eyes. “To change the subject, a bit of good news! Here, I was able to get your gift bag, Amelia!” Lord Yulan brought out a familiar neatly-wrapped gift that Amelia had left behind in the penthouse suite.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTQ3ZDcxYmYxMzQ4MDQ4OGRjMjkwNzQ1Mjk0ZDE1">“Thank you! Thank you!” Amelia hugged the gift bag close. “This is my mask for the festival!”</p>
<p class="cnNhNWRmNTBjMGFiMjQ2ODM4M2Y0OGQ0Y2E2ZmJlZjAz">“Hmm… I wondered what it was. Are you both going?” Lord Yulan asked, eyeing them both.</p>
<p class="cnMxNTk5YmFjMzdjYjRhMzg4NmY0ODg2ZWQ3YmQyODNi">“Thought we might soak up the atmosphere while we’re here,” Serena said, glancing at Amelia. “Hopefully, the war shortages won’t mean the firework display is smaller than usual. It’s the best part.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNjQxNTJkODhmZjRhNDc4ZWYxYjIyM2QyMGQzM2Mx">“I can’t wait!” Amelia piped up, noting that she had avoided mentioning the excessive amount of drinking Aiden had planned for the three of them.</p>
<p class="cnM0YmIxYmM3MDY0ZDRiZTY4OTkyMzQ4MGI3YzY2M2I2">“To be young again…” mumbled Lord Yulan. “Well, I wish I could offer you a place to stay in the Highguard, but it’s going to be at least a month before we’re ready to reopen, and then you’ll be gone!”</p>
<p class="cnM3MzI1ZmQ4NmU3NDRjZWJiNTI0ODY2YzZjNjBkOWRm">“I’m afraid so. We’ll have to experience your hospitality next time we’re here, old man,” Serena said.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjQ5NmUwYzU5NDQ1NjA4ZDdlMWZhOGY2NTE5MThh">“Before I go, there is one thing…” He fished out a letter sealed with wax and handed it to Serena. “It’s just a few words from me vouching for Amelia’s character. You mentioned Centralis Intelligence was poking about. Thought this might possibly help avoid a fight…”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjQ0YzdmMjU4ZDQzZWU4OTc2MzllODQzNWI3YWM0">Another letter of recommendation! That was awesome! Or rather, she was awesome? “Thanks grandpa!” Amelia exclaimed with a smile and two thumbs up.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmQxYmQzMDg1MjQ2NWI4YjQ5YzNlZjY0NWFmOTAx">“G-grandpa!?” Lord Yulan stuttered.</p>
<p class="cnM2YzQzYmYyNmYxZjQzN2RiM2UyOTMzYmY4ZjY1MjQ2">“Stop calling every old man grandpa, idiot,” Serena said, pulling her cheeks. “You’ll give them heart attacks.”</p>
<p class="cnM1N2JmN2ZkMGMxMjRlY2E5NDdlNzAwM2M0MmVhMWMz">“But they’re being so kind to me…” Amelia whimpered as her cheeks were gently pulled in circles. It sort of felt like a massage. Should she mention it felt nice to Serena? No, she shouldn’t. If she did, Serena might stop using it as a punishment.</p>
<p class="cnNhZGEzZmUzM2UxYjQ3MTliZjRmY2JiNTBhZjdjMDM5">“Idiot,” Serena said again, releasing her cheeks.</p>
<p class="cnNjYWUxZTExNzQ2NzRhMTA4ZGJkMGU4MDkzZjZhZWM2">They bid Lord Yulan goodbye, and he promised to come back before they left Kenhoro.</p>
<p class="cnMyZmQ0MmY2MzgwMTQ4Y2I5NGZjZWVlNDRkNTFiOTBi">On the fourth day, they visited the Central market again. The crowd was packed and they had to push their way through. Amelia noticed that more and more demon horns were decorated with crystal bands and earrings. Although Amelia figured they weren’t called <em>earrings</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNmZjlkNGRlOGU5MzRlNGQ4MDMyMmE3MDI0YjEwNzRi">“They are <em>hornbands</em> and <em>hornlets</em>,” Serena explained when Amelia asked her. “There are also <em>horncaps</em> which are pretty self-explanatory. On the day of the festival, you’ll see a lot of demons painting their horns in all kinds of colours. There are often awards for the most impressively decorated set of horns. To some noble families, that prestige means a lot.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjU3MDI5ZDJlYTRmMDQ4MjRjODhjNDY0MzlmNzA4">As the festival drew close, it wasn’t just the horns that changed. Bunting, flags, and other decorations appeared along the walls and roofs of buildings. Statues of kami were being dressed up, and more and more people were wearing costumes.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWMyNDMyODJjNzQzYzU5YmMyNGViMWZjM2Y2ODUy">“It’ll start in the outer districts, and there’ll be several groups moving in a circle around the city. They’ll all eventually meet up in the centre for the final events. I imagine Aiden won’t have us following it for long. The pubs are going to be <em>packed</em>.” Serena sighed, giving Amelia a smile. “Try not to drink too much, alright?”</p>
<p class="cnNmYzJjNjM1M2U0MTRhYjdiMWRmYTViNDA1N2U2NGMx">“But last time I drank loads, some really good things happened!”</p>
<p class="cnM4MjU5MDBmM2Q4MzRlYTk4MGZlMDNhMjQwNzBjNTlm">“Shut up…” came the muttered response, joined by a slight blush.</p>
<p class="cnMwM2JiZTk5NTBiMDRlYTBhMWU5MDZlNTg4NDYyYjJm">Together they found the stall owner who sold the masks. He recognised them immediately and showed Amelia the red mask. It was similar to her own blue one, but the red glow gave it a mature allure that would fit Serena perfectly. Once she indicated she was happy with it, the stall owner wrapped it neatly, and the pair of them left the market with Amelia buzzing with happiness.</p>
<p class="cnNjZWI4ZmU5M2I5NTRlNTZiYzg5OGEyNGVhNGJjNzg5">Their next destination was to check in on the tailor, who jumped from her seat when they walked in. “You’re finally here! I didn’t know how to contact you!”</p>
<p class="cnNiMDFmNTNmMmYwMTQ0OWFhMWY2ZjdkMTBlYmZiN2Rj">“Hello!” Amelia said cheerfully. “How goes the, uh… tailoring?”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjg4NjFmZGVjYjRiY2Y4NzFkNGQzNTcxZTRmYzdm">“I have one workset complete and two casual ones. Would you like to try them out?” The tailor immediately began buzzing around her, adjusting different parts of Amelia’s clothing as she talked.</p>
<p class="cnNlODU4NGJhZmUzNTQ4MzlhNmU1M2M2NDhkMTdiNzRk">“Mmm! Sure! Can you show me how to tie it all properly again?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NWUzZTgxYzliNjQ0YTFiNmQ3NjZlOTc5NmE2ODYy">Amelia tried all the outfits on. The workset was particularly impressive as it had so many hidden pockets and pouches. It was also designed so it could be worn inverted in case it became dirty. Amelia kept quiet about her cleaning magic, as the tailor seemed proud of this feature.</p>
<p class="cnM5MWRmYjBjNjdjMDRhMzdiZTU2NGIwMWQ3ZjY0ZGEw">After the work and casual clothes, she was thrown into a prototype of the red dress the tailor had been working on. In Amelia’s eyes, it was a perfect dress that balanced modesty and the allure of her body and cleavage. She felt it fit her form perfectly, but the tailor kept muttering about mistakes and adjustments that needed to be made.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTJjZGRhOTA3ODQ0MGY4M2I1YWNkMzFlMzI0ZTEx">“What do you think?” She said, unable to resist the sly smile she felt creeping up on her face as she stepped outside the changing room and did a twirl for Serena. Perhaps it was a mistake as the demon's mouth dropped open for a moment before Serena realised and closed it. Amelia didn’t miss the look in her eyes, though. It was the same look she usually only saw in the bedroom.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmZjOTU0YmJkNzQ2YmJhYzk0ZWY2ZjgwOGM4ZTYx">“It’s… uh, good. Fitting for an employee of House Halen. Your work is admirable.” Serena visibly swallowed and Amelia gave her a cheeky wink. She turned so her arse was facing her girlfriend.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjM5M2JlNjljMDRlNzdiNzY4ZTM5MjgwMDQyMWFk">“So, is it easy to put on and remove, or will I need assistance?” She asked innocently while squeezing her buttcheeks with both hands, out of sight of the tailor facing her but right in the eyesight of her girlfriend. She didn’t quite hear the tailor's reply as she was focused on the sensation of Serena's gaze burning a hole through her dress.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGYyNWMyNGM2YjRlNjU4Y2JlYzVmYzgwMTU4ZjMx">Her girlfriend couldn’t meet her gaze when she turned around, so it must have had the intended effect. Serena gave the tailor the inn's location to send the clothes and then made her excuses for the pair of them to leave. It started to rain, so they put on their brown raincoats and hats and jumped on a busy tram back to the inn.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzg2MTY1MjlmMDRjMDM5NGRmZDI1MTNhZGY5Mzk1">Serena hadn’t said anything during the ride, and Amelia was going to ask if she had upset her but was cut short when she felt her girlfriend's hand slip into her raincoat and feel her up. Amelia gave a small squeak before covering her mouth. She leaned into Serena, letting herself be groped before slipping her own hand through the layers of leather and paying Serena back in kind.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDk3MzFiZmZhNzRkY2I4MWVkNGI1ZWJjNGUwOGUx">When they returned to the inn, they barely made it through the door before Serena quite literally threw her on the bed and climbed on top of her with eyes full of desire.</p>
<p class="cnNhNDNhZGY2ZmIzMDQ4ZmVhNjA4ZGEyNmViYjhiZGE1">“You need to be taught a lesson,” Serena said, pinning Amelia’s hands to the bed with her body weight.</p>
<p class="cnNjYWRlYTkyY2VjYTRhMTQ5ZDA3MDlhNzYxOGVhNjAw">“Oh no. I’m trapped and helpless!” She gave Serena her best <em>fuck me</em> eyes and made herself moan softly. “Whatever will my punishment be, I wonder? I-” She was cut off as her lips were stolen while Serena fumbled to undress her, almost ripping the clothes in the process.</p>
<p class="cnM2NWI5ODRhYzFkNTRmNTE4ZDQyZjE4NDM5N2ZlZDE5">The following events were quite possibly the most pleasurable Amelia had experienced in her entire life. She was stripped entirely naked, and Serena’s fingers and tongue went to places and crossed boundaries they never had before. Afterwards, as they caught their breath, one thought crossed Amelia’s mind.</p>
<p class="cnMxZjEyMzM5MWIwMzRjM2RiMTE5ZDZmNTAxZTdlMzhj"><em>So that’s what it feels like to be ravaged.</em></p>
<p class="cnM0NmY0YTIyY2YxYzQ1N2NiOTVjNmU0NDAyNTJjNjA0">She turned and cuddled Serena, and when she was confident the demon had fallen asleep, she leaned in and whispered in her girlfriend's ear in the quietest voice she could muster.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzk3M2NhN2FhZTQxY2NiMGFhZGZjZDIyYzQ5YTZl">“<em>I love you.</em>”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMwNjE0YWQ4ODc1MTQyMWU4MjI0NjgxNjI3NjUwMDIz"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNkOWM0NjI0NDQ2ZjQ2NDFhMjgyM2Q0Yjc2YWFkZmFj">After an awkward exchange of morning greetings, Serena took a shower in the washroom. She sat down as the warm water rained down upon her, clutching both her horns in a mixture of embarrassment and frustration. Was it normal for her thoughts and emotions to be so <em>strong</em>? She knew she liked Amelia, but the magnitude of her urges and how often she gave into them was like nothing she had ever experienced before.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWU4M2ZmOGIzMDQ2YjA4N2NkYjQ4Yzc5NmZjZDQ1">What she did to Amelia last night - what she <em>enjoyed</em> doing - were things she never thought she would ever do to another person, let alone a <em>human</em>. She’d lost herself in raw desire, and that smug idiot - her <em>girlfriend</em> - had only encouraged her!</p>
<p class="cnNiNTRhMjUwY2YwMDQyODFiYmJhMDczNmNjMzQyMTQz">Was everyone else this passionate behind closed doors? Or was their relationship different? The romance she had toyed with during her academy years was nothing like this. She let out a soft groan. Infatuation. That was the word that described her situation. Every time she had let her attraction to Amelia manifest into action, the human was right there to encourage it.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzljODRiZWJmNDRiN2Q4YmI0ODcyNTU2NTBhMzBh">Worst of all, she was undeniably proud of what she had done. She didn’t feel any regret, and knowing she could make those noises come out of her girlfriend from her fingers and her tongue was <em>satisfying</em>. When she-</p>
<p class="cnNhN2Q2MWEwODEyNzQxZWZhODAzNmY3MjBjYWVkODI5">Damn it.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjY4NjgxOTdlYzQ4NWNhNTcyZmMxY2YwYjQ3MWUx">Even thinking about it made her embarrassed.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDdkYjcwNjUxYzQyZTFhNzdiYWMwZWM3Zjc0MDhh">She dried and dressed herself and returned to the bedroom. Amelia was sitting in her undergarments, sipping coffee at the table. A second cup was waiting for Serena.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjVkYTBmNGNmYzQ4YTJiZDdhYWNlODA3MzdlMjdh">“I poured you a cup!” Amelia chirped as she began nibbling on a biscuit.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDExYWY3ODEzMjRmMTdhNjQyZGUzODg0NmRkMDYz">“Thanks,” Serena said, trying to sound normal to prevent the atmosphere from becoming awkward. She joined Amelia at the table and began drinking the coffee. Unfortunately, she found she didn’t know what to say, and a lingering silence weighed down upon them.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWJiNzYzMTg0ZTRiYzRhZGE1ZTkxY2ExNzU3YzRl">“I’m really starting to enjoy the coffee in Cascadia,” Amelia said idly.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzc3Y2QxM2FhMDQwOTg4YThlZjE1NTQ0NWMxYzMw">“That’s good… It’s quality stuff,” Serena said quietly.</p>
<p class="cnMzM2JmOTgyNTY1YzQ3NDBhNjRjOGZhMWFhMGFmMzIx">“Do you want to talk about last night?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjBhMTJiZGFmMzQ5Yjc4YjU1ZjE0OTQ3MGYzZWRi">“I do,” Serena said, taking a long sip of coffee to give her time to think. She would just power through this as if she were on a battlefield. “I guess, with how intense it was…” She glanced at Amelia and she was relieved to see they were both blushing. “I’m worried that I pushed too much too quickly. I hope you didn’t feel like I was… overpowering you?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMGIxNTkxMmFjODRmOGY5M2VjZmQ5OTRhOGE5YmM5">“Not at all!” Amelia smiled softly before hiding most of her face behind her cup. “I <em>really</em> like what you did. I promise you, if I’m ever uncomfortable about anything, I’ll let you know, alright?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YmI3MTY4NjVkYTQ2NDg4MmZlOTNmYzJmODQ5NGI5">“Right. Thank you…” Serena felt what little guilt she had over last night evaporate. After all, if Amelia had enjoyed it as much as she did, then there was no point feeling bad. “I’ve been thinking, and I just think that our relationship is so… so…” She waved her hand, “<em>Irregular</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNjQwOGYzZDMwZTQzYjQ5MjhhM2YyNTRiYzliOGUw">“Irregular?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNWQ5OGE3MmFkYjRjNDA4ZTM0MTAwMmJlMzU3MDdj">“That’s right. I’m the daughter of a Highlord. Any relationship I’m in should be something organised and sanctioned by both families. There would be a long period as the engagement slowly progressed. The meetings would always have attendants nearby, so any passion,” her eyes flicked to Amelia’s lips, “Wouldn’t have a chance to be acted on.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NjM3OWVkZmJiOTRhZjdhN2ZlODczMDdlNDZhN2I0">“And… because what’s happened with <em>us </em>so quickly,” Amelia gestured to the pair of them, “You feel out of your depth?”</p>
<p class="cnMwYTZhZDhkYzUwNDQyNjBiZDczNTUwOTYyZDlmMzMw">“I guess so,” A sigh escaped Serena’s lips. “It’s more than that. My emotions are so strong I don’t feel like I’m in control. It’s honestly frightening, but I also like it, I think.” At her words, Amelia put down her coffee cup and stood up. She approached Serena before sitting on her lap and placing an arm around her.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTUzMTEwNTQyZDRjZjRhNDNlYTY1Yzg5MTcwZDdh">“Well, I’m delighted to hear you’re as crazy about me as I am about you! Sometimes, you make me so happy I feel like my heart’s going to explode!” Amelia gave her a peck on the forehead before running her hand through Serena’s hair and giving her a massage.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDY5YWU2ZGJlMzQzYWRiZmUxYTc4NDlmZjJmZDg5">“Are you… massaging my head?” She raised an eyebrow, giving her girlfriend a sly smile.</p>
<p class="cnNjNDNhMTRlNzgzYTQwMjE4MjNjNGU4NmUzNDg1Y2U0">“Yup! Do you like it?”</p>
<p class="cnNkM2E2MDllNmY0ODQ3ZDhhNTA2MmNhNjA0OWQ5YzEz">“... Yes, keep going.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNWRlZTVmOWIzZDQ4YmVhMTkzNjc1ZGFjNTNmYzMy">A minute passed, and Serena slowly relaxed. She realised she liked these quiet moments of intimacy as much as what happened last night. Sitting here with Amelia while receiving a massage felt so <em>right</em>. She nuzzled Amelia’s neck, lightly kissing her.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDc0Y2Q5MzFiMTQ2NGNhZDI0YWVmZDczMTdhZmVl">“It’s going to be difficult to keep my hands off you when we’re sailing,” Serena whispered.</p>
<p class="cnM2NWE4OTZhNTU4NzRjMDY5ZWYwMTNjZmUzNGQyNDc5">“Not much room in those hammocks, right?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MTkwZWYwNmFkMzRkOGVhZTgxY2QzOWQ2M2M3MTlk">“Right.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZWY4ZTM0MTg1ZDQxZWRiNzFkZmU4YzMzMTk0NWIy">“Well, we do have a few weeks to get it all out of our system,” Amelia said with a cheeky grin, “And I still need to repay last night’s favour!”</p>
<p class="cnM5NGYwNDgzOTA4NTRlMWE5YjFmMWExNTljOGU1NjIx">“Tsk!” Serena ruffled Amelia’s hair. “You’re trying to make me flustered again, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMDRhNTQzZTc1YTRkY2I4ZGM1ODAwMzM2YjEzMmM5">“Obviously, and it’s working!” Came the reply behind the blond mop.</p>
<p class="cnNhYmVjMWI2ZDViMjRiZTViMmE1ZGI2OTE0NjE3MzIw">“That’s it!” Serena declared, “From now on, I refuse to be embarrassed or flustered by anything you say!” She leaned back in her chair, folding her arms and trying to look as serious as possible.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODU1ZjBjN2QzOTRjZmE4ZWM4NDM3OTM4MzRlYzEz">“Is that so?” Amelia asked, using her hands to make an opening in the blond curtain of hair. “How about a bet, then?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MjVkMjUzNzJiMTRkMTU5OWMyYzVkNmExNTQwMWUw">“A bet?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZWM4ZTRkMzVjNDRkZGZhYzE2NTA4NTQ5OGJkOTZk">“I’ll ask you one question, and if you can maintain eye contact with me, I’ll tone down the teasing.” Two blue orbs gazed at her with an unidentifiable twinkle. “Deal?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTAxZmEzYjA4NDRmNTE5MjI4YzQxMTc3NzBiMWJi">“And if I can’t?” Serena narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWY2Y2NiM2Q2MzQ1NDQ4NTZhMWM4NDQ3YTA4OTE5">“Then you have to promise me you’ll never hold back! Any time you want to kiss or hug me, then you have to do it! Unless the situation is completely inappropriate, of course!”</p>
<p class="cnNkMzE1ZDFkMTJiNzQxNTRiMTU2MGY4MmQ3YWFjYjRh">“Fine then, I’ll take that bet.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZTZkMWQ1MTBkZTQyNTliYTAxN2ZkMmVhYzFkZGE0">“Great! Are you ready?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNjA4ZGI5MGFjYzQ3ZDg5MWVhNjk0NDZkM2I2Yjk1">“Was that the question?”</p>
<p class="cnMxNzU0MGM4OGM0ZjRjMzZhMTE2ZDczZjI3NTkwNzhk">“No, you smart-ass demon!” Amelia stuck her tongue out, “It’s not going to be that easy.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MjEzN2EwZmFmYTRlZWJhMzk4NTcwYjFiMTZlZDg0">“Let’s hear it then. I’m ready.” Serena focused on their eye contact, feeling determination take over.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzQ2YjQ4MzcwMjQ0ZjU4MjdiZjEzMzc1MWMzYTgx">“Okay!” Amelia coughed lightly into a closed hand. “Ahem! Did you-” Her girlfriend broke eye contact and buried her head in her hands with a groan. “Hang on, hang on!” She made eye contact again. “Did you li-” Amelia stopped her question again, breaking out into an uncontrollable nervous giggle. “Damn it! It’s too crass, even for me.”</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2NkYmExMzIyMjQwOTZhNzZjY2NiZjAxYmJlN2Ix">“Oh? So I win, then? If you can’t even ask the question?”</p>
<p class="cnMyZDg2MTdkZTZkNjQ4ODRiMGE5NTc5NWUzNDU3NTll">“No, no!” Amelia waved her hands before taking a few deep breaths. “Okay, I’m really ready now. I just needed a moment to prepare,” Amelia wriggled on Serena’s lap, moving closer until their eyes were only six inches apart. The human’s face was as red as Serena’s crimson eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODcxYjMzMzUxNzQ2ZGM4NTU3OGNhMGU2N2NhODdi">“Did you like it when I used your horns as handles while your tongue was between my legs?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNjZhZTBjZGI3NjQ3MDE4NzQzZGViZmQ1MzQzOTYy">Serena snapped her eyes closed as she pulled Amelia into a tight embrace so she wouldn’t have to look at her. As the heat erupted on her face, she made a mental note never again to make a bet with her girlfriend.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2JhZWUxNWFjNjQ3OTQ4MmYyYTdhNDg1NDZiMTNm"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZjE0YzJmYjJlMzRjMGE5ZDU4MDljMTViMjEzZWI2"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjRhM2E0Nzc2ZjQ0ZjBiZThjYmI5OWVlYzU4YWFm">“Are you <em>sure</em> you don’t want Tomes to come with you?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZjE5YjExYmMzZTQ1YTRiMDViYjM3YjkzODk0ZjIw">Amelia rolled her eyes. What did Serena think she would get up to!?</p>
<p class="cnM2YjhiNzYxY2U0NzQyMTU4ZDgwZjlkNTUzMGY4ZjNk">“What could I possibly get up to? I’m just going for my lesson with Grandpa Gu,” Amelia gestured with both arms to one side before switching to the other direction, “Then I’m coming back here. Easy.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZTBkZjY5NjRkNTQ2ZDQ5NGY4MjI5NmJlNTI1M2Zk">“Uh-huh,” Serena, Tomes, and Aiden said in unison.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjMwMzRmODc2MzQ0ZjNiYjg2ZGUzZWU3NDNiN2E0">Aiden had appeared at the inn during her morning lesson with Tomes. Apparently, his superiors wanted to question Serena about the Highguard incident and other matters. The timing meant those two would not be able to make that day’s swordsmanship training. Amelia had offered to go with them, but Serena immediately shot down that idea.</p>
<p class="cnNlOWQ0YTRlNmFiMDQ0YmJiMzhhMTU0M2E0YzZmZTI0">For some reason, the three of them seemed suspicious when she declared she would attend the academy training alone. Her girlfriend was initially against the idea but relented quickly. One thing Amelia liked about Serena was she was protective but not <em>over-protective</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTY0MmFmYjg2MTQ2MDhiMmZlY2FmZjAyN2IxMzM4">“Bye!” Amelia waved at them as she hopped on a tram. In less than a week she had become very adept at hopping on and off the steam-powered transportation. When the conductor approached her she fumbled about counting the required copper coins but managed to pay for a ticket. Serena had given her a rundown of the imperial currency and its denominations.</p>
<p class="cnM5OGMxOTZjNTFhMjQ1YWY4YmIwYTcyODBjOWY0NWIy">After clambering onto the second tram Amelia spent her time sounding out the stop names as well as trying to read any passing Imperial signage on shop fronts. Manwese was still impossible for her but Imperial was slowly falling into place. She figured she would know enough to get by in a month.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmZlNmMyN2Q2MjRlMGI4Y2YzOTk0OTU3ODBhMzZm">Arriving at the academy, she skipped past the gate guards with a greeting before heading into the main building. She had appeared at the time students and instructors were moving between lessons and she was lost in the river of bodies. No one spoke to her, but her blond hair stood out and more than a few utterances were heard by her sharp ears.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjBhYmJiYThiYjRhMTA4ZmU4ZjY1MjU1OWU0NDI1">“It’s that human again.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NDRkZDIxYzdjMzQ2MGZhNTNlZjg5YjkwZGI1YWI2">“What do you think she does every day?”</p>
<p class="cnMzYTI0MzcyMTFlZTQ2ODViOGViYzNjNGU1YjNmZGFj">“She’s alone this time.”</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2MxMDU5YWJlMDRhNGM5MTQ0NzVlODIwOWNkODdk">“Think she’s training? She has a wooden sword.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MmM4ZDgzNjBiNzRhOGRhNDQ4OTVkMWQ1MDQyOWZl">Amelia hummed to herself as she navigated the now-memorised corridors and stairs before arriving at the private training hall. Slipping inside, she bowed politely to the Grandmaster swinging a sword. Her bows had also improved greatly. It was something Serena had been making her practice every evening.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDNjZDE4NzMyZjRjMjM4MjUyNjE0YzAwY2IzZmVj">“Hello, grandpa!”</p>
<p class="cnM4MzgyNzJlZWI0MTQ0ZjY5ZjE3MTkzYWQ5NGQxNjJm">“Hmm…” grumbled the old man, “Just you?”</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2ZmNTAxMmFmZTQ2NjA4MTkxM2ViOGE2MTU0YTNm">“Serena and Aiden had a meeting they needed to go to. So it’s just me today!”</p>
<p class="cnM1NWQwN2YxNTVkYjQxZmZhMjhmM2Y4MmZiOGVkNGMx">“Very well. Let’s get started.” Together they went through her stances, strikes and katas. After warming up, they went back into sparring, where the grandmaster would push her to the limits of her body's movements. Now he would immediately invoke the first aura and begin attacking her. The aura-powered strikes were a magnitude more difficult than a normal attack and Amelia was soon sweating from exertion and focus.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTkzZWE5ZGY0MDRhNGY5M2MzNTJhNzk4YTFjMGE3">After a while, the attacks slowed down and she was instructed how to exploit openings. The grandmaster would intentionally hesitate between attacks and she would do her best to manoeuvre her sword into a strike. Unlike before, when they would both aim to stop their blades short, she was instructed to actually <em>hit</em> the grandmaster with a decent amount of force.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGU3NGFlYmYyZTQ3ZTU4NTliOWU3ZjljMWY2MDgz">“Are… are you sure?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmNjZmE3YWE3NDQwMzE5OTgzMjZhNTY4MWViMzRm">“I know you’re strong, but that sword will break before my aura does. Have no fear.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNGM3NTc4YmI1YzQ1MDk4N2E0ZjQxZTYwOGQwNWQ3">“O-okay!” Amelia parried an attack before swinging her sword around and colliding it with her opponent's shoulder. It was an attack that would surely break the bones of any normal person, but the grandmaster just grunted.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTM4NTVhNjI2MDRlNDJiZTAzNWQ1YmZiYTAwZGYw">“Good.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDE4Nzc0OGRkNDQ5MmZhOTY1ZmFmNDBjY2RmODFj">He spent some time explaining the aura of the warrior to her. Amelia was sure that if needed she could Speak the Words of the martial gods such as <em>Narean</em>. However when she had formed the Word as a test, it had felt <em>unnatural</em>. She was certain <em>Narean </em>would hold the communion true, especially after she had yelled at him so much, but there was definitely a feeling of <em>wrongness</em> with her aether which wasn’t there with her mage Words.</p>
<p class="cnMwZTFmZTI3M2YwOTRjMmY4N2UxYTM3ZGFkYjJlNzY5">“It is more difficult for a Speaker of magic to discover the first aura,” the grandmaster explained when they stopped for food, “The simplest way is to gain an understanding of your own body through exhausting it again and again. The problem is your constitution means there are very few training partners that could keep up with you. Perhaps only myself and my brother…”</p>
<p class="cnM2OWE5NmVlYmVmODQ4MWJhN2VjM2M2ZTBiNjZhMGRm">“So if I keep training with you, I could reach the first aura?”</p>
<p class="cnNkMDdmZTFlZGQ3YjRmNGI5MGFlNDQwZTRjODlmZDQ5">“Mmm… I believe so. Alternatively, you could wear heavy weights when training. Then you might be able to progress on your own.”</p><span class="cjllMjBhNmMwNDVjMzQ4YTI5MWE2YzZiYThjNTU5NmEx"><br/>Stolen from its rightful place, this narrative is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlZTU2M2RiMjRkMjQ3YjA5YTc3N2NjY2IxYjMxYmQx">“What does it feel like when you break the first boundary?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YWE0MjA5MTE1YjQ3ZmI5NzhjNmIxYTk4ZWNmNzlj">“It is almost unexplainable,” said the grandmaster, “There is a feeling of a tremendous rush as your aether <em>changes,</em> and suddenly you’re able to structure it in a way you previously couldn’t. Visualisation is important, especially for the first boundary. Many students find that simply imagining themselves with red aura helped them reach it.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNDMxZjg1YTk1OTRlMmU5ZjJjMDA2NmQ4OTM1ZDc1">“Is this visualisation stuff why you and Serena spend so much time meditating?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDgyNGFmOWI5YTQ0MWRhYjgwNWYxZWRiZTUyZTA0">“That’s correct. The higher auras are more and more difficult to break through and require a deeper understanding of their sword and the reasons why it is swung.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDgyNGVlMjEwZjQwMzlhZTY0ODdiY2E4ZWJkNjVj">“I’ll do my best!” She exclaimed. Amelia would start meditating when she found the time. She would imagine herself as a great warrior in shining steel - no, <em>red aether </em>- armour as she and Serena defended against a horde of monsters!</p>
<p class="cnMyNmM3YTdhZDRmYTRiNjg4MzViYzY1OGY3NzA1MTcy">“There is one other thing I would like to address now that we are alone,” the grandmaster said solemnly while meeting her eyes with a serious gaze. “As you know, communing with the Words grants a permanent boost in the constitution of the Speaker.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYWNmNjAzNzkxNzQ5NDA4ZGU1YmM5OWNiYTY4YmVm">“... Right,” Amelia said softly. It was that boost, along with the rewards of countless game achievements, that allowed her perception to follow the sword swings so easily.</p>
<p class="cnMwMzcxYjJiZjAxNzQ4ZDE5MDUxNmNiZWQzY2Q1OTNk">“A decent swordsman who spars with you, knowing that you cannot make the first aura, will be able to make an educated guess that you are a Speaker,” the old demon’s eyes narrowed and his gaze became sharp. “But an experienced master, like myself, can tell from how your eyes move and how you react that you, dear Speaker, have communed <em>far more</em> than just one First Word.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjY3ZjVjNzcyMTQwNGE5OWMyMjc1YzZmYjE1ZjJm">Grandmaster Gu held her eyes, and Amelia swallowed nervously. She broke eye contact and rubbed the back of her head awkwardly. “I have unusual circumstances…” She mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTFmY2Q1ZmUxYzRjMDhiYmNhNTQzOThhYjkyZTll">“I’m sure you do,” the grandmaster replied, his eyes softening and his posture relaxing. “Have you ever heard of Katalin of Driss?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNWNmZmZhYTc1MDRhNWU4NjkxNmRkZGFkN2ZiM2Y2">“Umm… no. Where’s Driss?”</p>
<p class="cnM4MWQ2ODViZTgxNzRkMGI4OWIxZDgzMGNkNWM3OTk3">“Driss is located in the snow-capped mountains in the North. Katalin is a swordswoman, and like you, she is far beyond her peers. She has communed two Words of the martial gods, and rumour has it that she is on the threshold of a third. Some say she might become the youngest Greatlord ever,” the grandmaster chuckled. “Only, she has no interest in politics and apparently does nothing but train behind closed doors day in and day out. She attends no balls and fights in no tournaments. She is reported as being beautiful, yet the letters of potential suitors are answered only by a polite refusal. The woman is married to the sword.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMjA2NGNkNmY1ZDRhZDRhOGU3NmM3ZDNmYmVmNGM1">The grandmaster coughed lightly, “Ahem! Anyway. The point I’m getting at is that despite her lonely lifestyle and her complete absence from the public - Katalin of Driss is a name that every wielder of the sword aspires to. She is constantly talked about in this academy. Her fame carries her name from the Ishaq in the south all the way to the city of Navathe in the corner of the Sabanis Dominance.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzBkMGY4MjgwYTQxMTY5YTI0MjE5ZTJlZjEyZjBj">“And that,” the grandmaster jabbed a finger into the ground, “Is how famous she is when she has done nothing to encourage the public. But <em>you</em>,” now the finger was pointing at Amelia, “Are an employee of a famous House, working under a famous captain boarding a famous ship. You’ll see a lot of the Empire, and where you go, everyone will not just hear the name of Amelia Thornheart but also see the person behind the name.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ODZjNWM2Y2ZjZTQzMjhhNjJmNWE3M2E4NGIxNzJk">The grandmaster sighed, “I just want you to understand you will eventually become famous. Rumours of your healing have already reached many of my circles. It is only because someone is blocking your photograph from appearing in the papers you’re not identified on the street by the general public. That will change, eventually.”</p>
<p class="cnNlM2FkNDIyOTVhMTRjMzI4NTkwNzY1YTVmYjQ3NGY5">“I… I understand,” Amelia nodded, thinking seriously about the advice. “I’ll be prepared, and besides, if it gets too much I’ll run away to this academy and train in secret!” She gave the old man a grin as his eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDcwMjQ3NGIxODQ4NDBhNWRiOTc0NGNjNjlmMTNj">“W-well,” he said, “You’ll always be welcome while I’m the director of this place… I don’t know what Speaker Halen would make of such a turn of events.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMmQ0YmY1NGE2YzRmYjU4YzYxOWI3MTljZDMzMmM5">“Nah,” Amelia shook her head, “I’ll drag her along with me! She’s really enjoying the training, you know? She told me she can feel the rust falling off every day!”</p>
<p class="cnNlOTlmOTI1ZDdhOTRmNTc5MjUyMzEyMjM0OGU5Nzc3">“Hrmph! She should quit the military. It’s done her no good,” mumbled the grandmaster.</p>
<p class="cnMwODI1ZjBkMDE0YTRkYTI5YWU1MmI0OTFjZTU3NzA1">They both finished their food in silence before training some more. After an hour, Amelia bid the grandmaster farewell and headed back through the academy’s corridors. She was so lost in thought about her impending fame that she took a wrong turn and ended up standing at one of the entrances of the academy’s main training ground.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjQxZjFjYzliMDRhNWNhOTg4NjQ3MjU2Y2FjZDkz">It was a massive open area of sand and packed dirt. The entire academy was built around it, and at any one time, you could be seen from hundreds of windows and balconies of the floors above. Dozens of students were using the space. Some were alone, and some were in groups. Some were paired up and sparring while others practiced katas. About half of the students had grey belts, and the other half had red. A small number had orange belts, although Amelia noted they seemed to be training alone.</p>
<p class="cnNjY2FmNzQ2YTYwMTRjZGNiM2RkMmRiMmRiM2I1YTYx">At the rhythmic sound of dozens of swords being swung, she felt a sudden urge to join them. How would it feel to swing her sword in unison with a group?</p>
<p class="cnM2MjcxZGYxYWVmNzQzZTY5MzdlMDBhZTg2YjRiODJh">Besides, the massive doors were open. That meant she was basically invited, right?</p>
<p class="cnNiMDlmNzc0NjM3NDQ5NGFhNjYxMTE2Y2M1MzQyMzI2">Telling herself this was definitely okay, Amelia walked a little into the training area. She was far too nervous to walk into the open space proper so she lingered around the edge. She resolved herself to just watch for a few minutes. She was interested in the differences in training of the grey, red, and orange students as well seeing if she could identify any mistakes the grey students were making.</p>
<p class="cnM4ODg5MTFlM2Y2YzQyNzM4MTBlNjViMDc3ZDgxMTAz">Slowly, her presence was noted by more and more of the demon students and more and more eyes were glancing in her direction. As she started to pick up on muttered words, she decided coming here was perhaps not the best idea. Before she could turn to leave, a voice called out to her.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTRjY2RjOTk3YjQ2ZGFhNDY4NjUxYjMzOTA2OTBl">“Hello there! Never thought we would see a <em>human</em> here!” Amelia turned to see a demon from a nearby group had approached her with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. The girl looked to be about twenty, and had two neat horns that extruded from her head. She approached Amelia, flanked by a half dozen students behind her.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDg4YWM1YjBmNzQwMjY5MmIzMTgyMjVkZjAyN2Ew">She wore a red belt.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjQ2ZDQ5OTFmYzQwNzNiOGJkNDgzYTQ2NjQxMzRl">The demon looked her up and down. “We’ve been seeing you come here every day. Many of us have been trying to figure out who you are and why you’re always here with the <em>war hero</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTViOGQzMmJhZjRhMmJhM2Y0NWNlYjAwOWZhNjNm">Right. Serena was a war hero. Unsurprisingly, many of the students here had a favourable opinion of her girlfriend. Amelia chose her <em>lets-be-friends</em> smile and tried to extrude an aura of friendliness.</p>
<p class="cnNkN2EzMTc4MDFjMDQ5MzhiYzJlZWQ5Mjg1YzI4NmQw">“I’m her maid!” Amelia chirped, “What’s your name?”</p>
<p class="cnM0NzIyZGQwMzM0OTRjMzk4Y2QwNTQ1NDMzMmVlOGZm">“You’re a maid?” The demon narrowed her eyes. “You don’t look like a maid. Why do you have that sword?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDY2OGNjZDI1MTQ1ZTdiYzY5ZWYzZDhjMTU2Y2Qw">“Uh… because I’m learning how to use it?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MDViY2FmYmY2ZjRjNDBiYzMzNTA4MWVhZGE5NzJi">“The <em>hellfire captain</em> has taken a human as a maid and is teaching her the sword?” The student's face expressed disbelief.</p>
<p class="cnNiZWM1YzAwNDI5YzRiNmViNjAwMjI5YTAyMWY2NjRh">“That’s right! And, uh… Grandmaster Gu is helping out!” That was apparently the wrong thing to say as the demon spat on the ground.</p>
<p class="cnM2M2RlZTgxMGY5MTQxOThiMTQ3NTFhYTMxOWU2ZTI1">“Could you not come up with a more believable lie?” She said, venom seeping into her voice. “You really going to stand there and pretend the <em>grandmaster</em> is teaching a <em>human maid</em> in person?” A series of chuckles swept through the group as more and more students appeared. “What do you really do? Carry the food? Massage her feet?”</p>
<p class="cnMxNDUwNjE2MjkxODQ4MDViNGJhZDViNmVhMzgzZmVh">“Maybe she keeps her bed warm!” Another student called out, prompting the students to break out in laughter again. The one who had spoken was male and had an orange belt and a similar set of horns to the other girl. Her brother, perhaps?</p>
<p class="cnNlOWM1NTVmM2NjMDQyMTBhYWY1ZjBkZTBjYzkxYmZj">“How long have you been training, then?” The first girl asked, crossing her arms and sneering. Amelia resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Weren’t these supposed to be officers in training? They were acting like teenagers!</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTg1ZmU5NTJhMDRkMDhhODUwMjZlMjgzM2M4OTBm">“About a week,” Amelia said, changing her <em>lets-be-friends</em> smile to a generic sly smile. She must have come across as confident or arrogant, as the student looked taken aback.</p>
<p class="cnNmMGVlNzk5YzIwYzRkMjM4MWViNjVlY2FhZDgzMzc5">“What aura have you reached?”</p>
<p class="cnM3YjJmNzg0MjI0OTQ3YmVhOTA1YjU2M2Y4MDVmMTkz">“None,” Amelia shook her head, “But I’m working really hard at it! I think I can hit red in a few months!” She gave a not-so-enthusiastic thumbs up. Why did their eyes look so hostile? Was this a part of the discrimination humans were facing?</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2FlZTUxYjkyOTQ3MGU5YmFlYjIwMTQzMzk5NDQ4">“None! Ha!" The girl turned in a circle with her arms raised. Where did she think she was, in a theatre? “So we’re supposed to believe that <em>you</em>,” the student finished her performance and glared at Amelia, “A <em>maid</em>, who has only been training a week, who hasn’t reached any aura, is somehow receiving the personal instruction of both the hellfire captain and the grandmaster? Is that what you’re expecting us to believe? Huh?”</p>
<p class="cnM5OTZiODNlMGU1MTQ1OTlhYzAzYjdlZTM1MmZhNTE4">“... Now you say it like that, I suppose it sounds a little strange but-”</p>
<p class="cnMxYzU4NmEwNjA3ZjQxNWM5NTkwZTNmODc0NTA2NmNh">“What are you, some kind of spy?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OWMxOWQxNGM5MzQzNjU4Y2JiOTMyNGEwZjAyNDQz">“A Republican spy!” A voice called.</p>
<p class="cnNlMDU1N2ExYzIxYTQzNTA4ZTBjMzU1MzdlMWQ0NDA3">“Maybe she’s from the Federation!” Another student yelled.</p>
<p class="cnM4NmZkMjBmYzJlYzQ3NWM5MmFmODQxYThkNjJjZmFh">“I’m not a spy!” Amelia protested.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzlkMzAzNTExNzRhN2Y4ZTA4NDIzYjlmYzRjN2Y4">“Come on then, pretty little <em>spy</em>,” The girl with the neat horns pulled out her training sword. "Let’s see what you’re capable of. Don’t worry, I won’t hit you <em>too hard,</em>” she smirked. The students backed away, making an impromptu arena for the pair.</p>
<p class="cnNjYmExNDRlNDZkMzQ5MDM5ZmVjNTEzNjQzYWIyMDQw">“I really would rather not, I have things to do, so if you'll excuse me…”</p>
<p class="cnM4MWNjNjRjYmNjYzQwYjNhMGUzOGY1NzIxZWRhZDcw">“Running back to keep your master's bed warm? I bet you massage more than just her feet, isn’t that right?” The girl teased to the laughter of the surrounding students. Amelia rolled her eyes again at the childish statement. Still, she felt a flame of anger begin to tickle her heart.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTA0MWFiOTgwMjQ1NjE4N2ExOGM1NmYxZDA3ODBi">“You seem to spend a lot of your time being concerned about Lady Halen and her bedtime activities. Are you sure you're not compensating for something?” Amelia pulled her sword, gripping it in both hands. “What kind of hidden fantasies are you having about the <em>hellfire captain</em> that you’re too embarrassed to admit to?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjY1OWIxZTg4NzRkNDRhNzJlNzEzZGU0NzY0YWY5">“Bah! You disgusting human,” the student spat on the ground again. “I don’t know how you tricked <em>Speaker Halen,</em> but I won’t let a spy like you shame her name any longer!”</p>
<p class="cnNmMThlOTc4ZWM1NTQ3ZGFiMTg3NDI1NmI3N2FjYTlh">“Sorry, I’m so confused, why-” Amelia didn’t finish her question as the woman swung her sword at her head which she blocked with ease. The students surrounding them erupted in cheers.</p>
<p class="cnNmNGM1MzBlY2QzZDQzZGJiNjNlOGU1Zjc0MDkyZmFk">“Get her, Mel!”</p>
<p class="cnM3MmY0NzdhZDUxNDRiNzY5MDQwZjkzYTFjYTZiNTM5">“Show her what it means to wield a sword!”</p>
<p class="cnMxODc4ZDM5NTIxYTRlNWM4NGFkOTMzMjY5MGEwOTJk">“Punish that liar!”</p>
<p class="cnNiZTYyNzFhNmI4YjRiZWM4NmRmODE2YzEzMDA2NTdj">“Make her bleed!”</p>
<p class="cnM1YWFiYmFhYmEyNDRlMzA4MDUyYTg3ZTI1NzdjMWYx">Amelia saw behind the crowd two instructors were whispering frantically to each other, glancing in their direction. One of them ran out of the training hall while the other just stayed there and watched.</p>
<p class="cnMwMTU2Yzc4NzQ1ODQxODY4ODE1ODEzY2JkMDQxMTAw">The student called Mel attacked her again and again. She threw out a flurry of strikes that Amelia could tell had been practised thousands of times. They were far more controlled than her own, executed with more confidence, and…</p>
<p class="cnM5YTEwOTk0ZmFjNDQzMzJiYTExYzk0OTg3ZGU4ZTQ3">They were so <em>slow</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTJkNmE2ZmUyZTQ5MDBiYWZhMzhhYzFjNTBmMzQ4">Amelia frowned as she internally recalculated her expectations. She moved her body to respond to strike after strike. Unlike the vicious assault by the grandmaster, she felt like she could have defended against this all day.</p>
<p class="cnM2YWNlMTAwMjJkYTRmMTE4ZDViOWE4MjkzMzBkNWNl">“Is this all you’ve got?” Amelia said between blocks. Ha! She bet she looked super cool saying that. If only Serena were there to see it! Her mocking had the intended effect, causing Mel’s face to contort with rage.</p>
<p class="cnNiMWE5OWY1OGMzOTQ1MDc4ZGFhM2M1ZWM3OTE4YzVi">She would make a terrible officer.</p>
<p class="cnNiMzNiNDExOGFkZjRhMDY5MmQyMjgxYzU5YjdkYWJk">“Let’s see how you handle this!” Amelia sensed the aether in Mel froth as her body took on a red hue. The attacks took on a speed that required Amelia to focus a little more.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzUzYWJjMmJiMzRiMmQ5OTYwMDM4NTEwNjM2NGEz">Still, it was nothing like when Serena or the Grandmaster attacked her. In fact, she was sure Serena’s attacks without aura had far more speed and aggression. When the grandmaster used red aura, he could strike more than a dozen times a second. This student was managing about four.</p>
<p class="cnM3ODBlNDRmNDNlODRiN2I5NTM0MTczN2YxZTY4ZWQy">Amelia waited until Mel tried another thrust before parrying it like she had been taught. She swung her sword around and struck Mel’s upper arm with about the same strength as she used against the grandmaster.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDIwMTZlOGZkZjQ2ZWViZmRiOTJiMTRhM2JmODQz">That was a mistake as Mel’s red aura <em>collapsed</em> under her strike, and Amelia felt the bones in the upper arm shatter as her wooden sword slammed into her opponent.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWQwMWIyNDUxMzQwMjA4NzI4MDc1OTkyNDE3OGI4">“Argh! Ahhh!” Mel dropped her sword and collapsed onto the floor, screaming in pain.</p>
<p class="cnNkZWU0ZjgyMTNmZTRhZTY4OWM3NWIxNDYzM2MxNjA1">“What did you do to my sister, you bitch!” A voice yelled from behind Amelia. She turned her head to see a blade - <em>a real blade</em> - covered in orange aura, carving a path towards her face.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDg1MzZlMzA3NDQ0YTdiNjM0NWRiZWRmNmU4Njk4">Amelia felt her vision darken as her anger exploded at the attempt at her life. She flared the triple-wards she was running as hard as she could, and as the blade approached her nose, she leaned upwards and…</p>
<p class="cnMyNzg5YWVhODkwMDQwNzk5ZTAzMzRlZDM1MzQxZmIy">Bit down on the steel, shattering the sword with her teeth.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjk2N2ZjYmZhZDRmNjA4NmVlNDkzM2QwZWI3NTE3">She swung her fist at Mel’s brother, whose eyes had widened with shock. Amelia used all the speed she could muster without Speaking, slamming a fist into his ribs. She knew she could probably punch <em>through</em> the man’s body if she wanted, so she simply aimed at the spot where his ribs were and then added another inch.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDhjOWRlNGQ1MTQ1NWJhN2E3YjBjNjU4NGIwYjc1">The effect was immediately felt as she could feel his ribs shatter under her blow. The man crumpled to the floor, gasping and trying to scream but not being able to produce anything more than a whimper.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmI5NzJiOGE5NTQ3MzNiZWJkMTg5MjA3ZDYzOTcy">For a moment, all was quiet apart from the noise of the defeated siblings. Amelia glanced at the instructor in the background and was surprised to see him take a step backwards. She must have had one hell of a look on her face because when she made eye contact with any of the students, their faces went pale and they cast their eyes down.</p>
<p class="cnM0MmNlMDgwYWE1ZDRlMDZhMjZhYjEzOTQwMjk2NTVl">“D-did you see what happened?”</p>
<p class="cnM5OTQzZGFhYzEwNTQ0MTE4NWRiNDBkMjU0N2M5MjI4">“I couldn’t see anything!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NjFiOWUwYmIzNTQ5MjI4ODI3YWMyYTExZmMzMWU0">“She bit the sword! Bit it!”</p>
<p class="cnMyZjJmMTU0NGEzNzRiYjI4OWZkNWU4MTdlNGE0ZDE5">“How did she move so fast!?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZmU1NTM1OWI4MjQ5OGI4NmZkNThlNWJkYTc5OTEy">Amelia turned to leave, and as the students parted, a familiar set of horns appeared. Grandmaster Gu had come, flanked by the instructor who had run off earlier.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjgwMWFkMmYwMzRhYTNhMmZjNDE2ODg5OGYyOTE3">“Speaker Thornheart, what happened here for your eyes to show such anger?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTE0OTI0ZmE3YjRlNzM5YzhhOWJiMDZiM2E0NjM4">At his voice, the surrounding students erupted into another flurry of hurried whispers.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDVhNDk3NjJkYzRiOTM4ODE0NmUwZjg1ODRkNDJj">“Speaker! He called her a Speaker!”</p>
<p class="cnNiOTgzYjhhMjAwODQxMmFiZGEzZGYxMWNhMDlhNzE4">“Was she pretending all along?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNTYzMTBiNzc1MTQwZDM5M2FlMGQ1YTY4NGJlMjBj">“But she didn’t use aura!”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDEyMWQ5NDc1OTRkMDdhZmJhMDgyNTQ2NDFiOTU2">“Who is she!?”</p>
<p class="cnM1N2E2OGU2ZGZhODRlZWY4Zjk3OTQwZTU1MDFmNzZi">Amelia looked at the old man's crimson eyes, which held an unreadable expression. She swallowed before explaining her version of events. “I got lost leaving the academy. I found myself here and thought I would watch the students train. I wanted to see if I could see any of the mistakes in their training that you corrected in mine.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMjAyYzYyYzQwOTRiOTE4YTVlYTk4OTY2YTAzNjY3">She gestured to Mel, who was looking at her with a mixture of pain and horror. “This one disrespected me and Lady Halen. She accused me of being a spy and more. She wanted me to spar, and I broke her arm when I struck her back.” Amelia waved an arm at the gasping man on the floor. “This one tried to kill me. He swung at me with a steel weapon coated in orange aura at my face. As you can see.” She met the grandmaster’s eyes. “The sword lost.”</p>
<p class="cnNlOTA4ODU5MGIxNzRhMzdhYWY0OTVlMGQwMDhkMmFj">The old man was silent for a while, and it felt like everyone was holding their breath.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjQ3YTMxNWZmZDRiYjVhYzY4YWI4OGUyZWUwYTFi">“What did you learn?” The grandmaster asked her.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTkyMzdmNjg2MjRjNWY5NGRjN2Q3YmExNjEyMmQ2">“I learned… that there is more variation in the quality of aura than I thought. I counter-attacked with the same strength I use against you. That was a mistake,” Amelia shrugged. “I also learned that just because someone is a good swordsman,” she glanced at the man on the floor, “That doesn’t mean they have the temperament to be a good officer.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMjkwMGY3OTUwMTRkYzlhNmMzYjc4MzBkZjJlZGI0">“And what punishments do you think they deserve?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDJlMDliNmJmMTQxOGNiMjFkNmIwNjFhMDBmYmMx">“Umm…” Amelia thought for a few moments. She looked at Mel who swallowed nervously. “I agreed to spar with that one. So if anything…” Amelia bowed to the quiet student, “I apologise for breaking your arm. I am not a Speaker of the martial gods and am unfamiliar with controlling my strength.” She raised her body and kept her eyes on Mel. “After the festival, if she is willing to apologise to Lady Halen and me for her words, I will heal her arm.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MTlhZDg0NzE4YjRiZTg4YjMyMGI1YTI4NmYxNGEx">“Oh? Hmm…” The grandmaster turned to Mel, “Is that acceptable to you?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NTExYTAxNGY1MzRkYmI5YTVjYmJiMDMxNzYzYjM5">Mel swallowed nervously before answering in a quiet voice. “Yes, Grandmaster.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNjBlOTZlZGJjNzQwOGNiNTFiNWIwMzFjZjA4ZGU1">“Don’t answer me, answer her!” He barked.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzViNDk5MWM0NTQxZDM4N2ZlZDBmZTc0MTUyYTgw">“Ah… Yes, Miss Thornheart…”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzNlZjcyOWRlNTRjNjRhNzI3NGZmYTVhNDI4YWM5">“<em>Speaker</em> Thornheart!” The grandmaster barked again.</p>
<p class="cnNhOWY5MDgxMDVmMzQ5Y2I4MzI5ZDAxN2QyZjE2YThm">“Yes! Yes, Speaker Thornheart! I will apologise…”</p>
<p class="cnM0YjAxZmNmNzFiMTQyN2I4NWRkMWZjMGEyN2IwZDg5">“As for her brother,” Amelia pointed at the quivering man who had caught his breath and was looking at her and the grandmaster with fear in his eyes. “My understanding of Cascadian law is that trying to murder a Speaker is punishable by death. I suppose he would normally be hung.” Amelia shrugged as the man’s eyes widened and his mouth opened, “Normally, that is. I’m not yet a citizen of the Empire, so those laws probably don’t apply. I don’t know what should happen, but I won’t heal him for what he did. Maybe make him clean toilets for a year or something.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmJmNjljYTIzOTQ1M2Q4Y2QzNGU4OTAyYjY0OTk0">The grandmaster rubbed his beard. “Damian, is it?” He asked the demon who was clutching his ribs.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGFlYjk4ZDk5ZjQxOWVhMTFhZGEzNDhjZDQ0NTI2">“Y-yes, Grandmaster.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNzYzN2JlODQ5MjQwYjRiYjUyZDg0YTNkZGYyYWU3">“You’re supposed to graduate at the end of this year?”</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2E4ODU5ZDA2NTQ1ZjZiYTYxMmExYjFiODE2MDNi">“Y-yes, Grandmaster.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTVmMjYyZTkwOTQ3YmM5Y2I3NTkwMTA1NTFlZmVi">“Not any more. I’ll delay your graduation by two years. You’ll spend the next year from now cleaning toilets, and then the year after, you will focus on tutoring first-years. Only then can you graduate. A small price to pay, to avoid the noose?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjY2M2UzZTM0ODQwNjA5NzM5ZDE3NzU0NmEzYTU2">“T-thank you! Thank you, Grandmaster!”</p>
<p class="cnNmYzczZjQ1MWQ0MzRkMDU4NDE5NTdmNTM4ZDE2YTA4">“Don’t thank me, thank Speaker Thornheart, whose mercy has prevented so much shame from falling upon your family.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNGE4MmIyMjdhZDRkYTBhMGJkNjZmYzQ3Njk0NzU3">“... Thank you, Speaker Thornheart.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NjgwZTUwMWQxYjRhMGI4ZDc4ZWRjMjNkYTJhMTg3">“Excellent!” The grandmaster clapped his hands. “Looks like everyone here has learned a few important lessons, and it didn’t cost any lives! Remember! When you’re on the battlefield, the cost of lessons becomes the lives of your soldiers and your friends! Make these mistakes now, in the safety of my halls, before you make them in war!”</p>
<p class="cnMxNWYyNDg5NzgyNjQxZTE5YzM1NzlmNjFlMjc4OTc1">The grandmaster turned to Amelia. “Speaker Thornheart, I trust you’ll return to training after tomorrow's festival?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNTZkMjdhYmVkYTQwODA5OTczZDIyNjZiNmY0ZjNh">“Y-yeah!” Amelia nodded, “I mean, yes, Grandmaster!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNGZhNGE5MTFhZjRlNDM4MDhmMjgzODRkNjZlMDMw">“Wonderful! Now run along,” He gave her a smile, “Try not to stumble into any other training halls on the way out.” He gave a deep bow, which she returned. With a last look at her defeated opponents, Amelia turned and walked out of the training ground.</p>
<p class="cnM1NmI0ZGQxZTFlYTRjZmFhM2IzNjNjMTRmMTFhODVk">The tram rides back were a blur as Amelia ran what happened repeatedly in her head. She kept second-guessing actions she had taken or things she had said. What would have happened if she had done things differently? The possibilities kept creeping into her mind and occupied her thoughts all the way until she stepped through the door to the room at the inn.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjI5ZTRhZTdlMjQxZDBhMzhlY2JhOWIwZmVkMTYw">“Welcome back,” Serena said idly, not looking up from her paperwork. “So, when should I expect the city guard to come knocking with your arrest warrant?”</p>
<p class="cnM0OWE2MjYxNzIzNDQzZTA4NmQyNWQ4ODdiMzQ0ZjEw">“You… you! How did you find out so quickly!?” Amelia blurted out as Serena looked at her in surprise.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWJkMTE5ZjVmNTQ2MTlhMWNkNjIyYzg0ZTQxMGRl">“Christ! Seven hells, I was only joking. You idiot! What have you done now!?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNmZlYjcyZDJmNDQwODBhN2I1NzBkYWFhYjMyNmI4">Oops.</p>

      <description>Chapter Twenty-Six: The Moonrain Festival</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNmMjhlZDQxNTlhZDRhMTg5ZTIxYTAzN2NkMTAyZTk5"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNjOWYyNWI4YmI5NTQ5YmNhZjY0NTc1MzYwNzE2NTVk">After having her hair ruffled and cheeks squeezed, Amelia was able to recount the tale of events to an annoyed-looking Serena. Her girlfriend’s glare softened when Amelia explained Grandmaster Gu’s reaction and the hair ruffling slowly changed into a gentle head massage.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjVkYTc4MTUyNjQ5YzliZDcyYWNkOWM4NGM4Yjc2">“Mmm…” Amelia murmured, “I don’t understand why they got so aggressive so fast. I would have thought trainee officers would be far more composed…”</p>
<p class="cnM1NWNlNzdkNDQ1YTQzNWNhZjNhYzZkNjFmYzk5OGEw">“Idiot,” Serena replied, running her hands through Amelia’s golden hair. She sat Amelia down and began to comb through the ruffled mess. “Some of it was probably anti-human bias. They’re trainee officers; you know the first thing that gets drilled into your head throughout your time at the academy?”</p>
<p class="cnNiMzYxOTk2YjY5MjQxOTY5MjZhZTdmYTRhZTc2Yzg4">“What?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZjAzMjdlNDI4ZTQ5NmZhOTIwMmJmYmMwZjUwZGNl">“To watch out for human spies. That’s the singular lesson that gets repeated constantly throughout the years. Then you turn up in their academy, poking your nose in their training. If you <em>were</em> a spy, think about the information you could get,” Serena explained, slowly teasing out the knots in Amelia’s hair, “Counts of how many students had reached red aura, counts and identities of those reaching orange.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOGFlODZmNTgwZTQyODNhOGY5ZjEyNDFkMGVmMjVi">“Oh, that makes sense… but surely they would have seen me enough to know both you and the grandmaster were okay with me?”</p>
<p class="cnM0NmQxZmM1ZTk2OTQ4NmVhZGIxMjI0MWFkOTQ5NTg5">“Right,” Serena said, “If they had looked at the situation calmly, things might not have escalated. It turned out like it did because you insulted their egos.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZWUxMDI5Y2UxOTRhYzFhNjM2MDZhMDI5ZGM0OGY5">“I did? How?”</p>
<p class="cnNiMTdiNWI2NmUyMTRjNmViOGU2ZDQyMDQxZjA2Yjc0">“Saying you were getting personal training from the grandmaster after only holding a sword for a few days,” Serena finished combing and began giving her a shoulder massage. “Getting instruction from a grandmaster is an incredible honour, and most students will never have the privilege. It would’ve angered them for you to speak about it so casually…” Serena paused as if in thought, and her hands became idle. “At least you didn’t call him grandpa in front of them, you idiot.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZGZhNWVmOTgwMDQ3MThiYjljNDk0NjcyYjQ0OTZj">“Don’t stop! It feels nice…” Once Serena’s hands had resumed massaging her shoulders, Amelia asked her if there was anything else that she had done to make the situation worse.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzRlOTgxNmNkYjRiZjA5Mzc2M2I2ZDQzNmMxMGQ5">“You implied you could learn red aura in such a short period of time. Even if it’s true, most of those students have been training for a decade just to build the foundation to get into that academy. Half of them won’t ever reach red. You would have come across as arrogant.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZjcwMGNmNzRhNTQyMzI4OTAxZThhY2MzZGQxODQ3">“There’s something else I don’t understand; They seemed to respect you as a war hero, but made jokes about me keeping your bed warm…” Amelia felt Serena’s hands grip her shoulders slightly harder. “It doesn’t add up. Why would they insult you if they respected you?”</p>
<p class="cnM1OTFhY2ViZWYxNTQ1YTU5YmZkZmRmMDJiODYxOWUy">Serena took a moment to answer. “It was an insult to you, really. Saying you serve me only as a… <em>paramour</em>. To say it to you - another female - is to imply you’ve accepted payment to engage in acts of homosexuality which most people consider… unnatural.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NDU2ZTE2NmUxYzQ3ODNiMTVkYWZlZjJjY2VhMGEw">“Nothing about how I feel about you feels unnatural!” Amelia gritted her teeth. “I hate that word. Our connection is as natural as anyone else’s!” Amelia tilted her head backwards to look at Serena. “Do you feel it, too?” she asked.</p>
<p class="cnMyMmRmMmVmMDg3NzRlYWVhNTUxZmM4NDMxYTdhMzBm">“Yes,” Serena bent down, giving her a kiss on the forehead and then on the lips, “I do.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YTJmYzE2YTU3OTQzMTliNzZkM2IzMzhiZDg4YWNl">The pair then went downstairs for some food. Amelia was getting rather good at using chopsticks now and could neatly construct her little mouthfuls with what she thought was elegance and grace. Serena still pointed out flaws here and there but declared that she was approaching a level of etiquette that she deemed <em>passable</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM1YWIwYzczNzYxMjQzZDg5MzJhOTYyNzk0MGEyY2Yz">Mister Weng appeared and handed Serena a small box. It came from the tailor and was Amelia’s red festival dress. She wanted to open it right there and then but Serena made her wait until their meal was done and they were back in their room.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjEyNmNjMTViNzQ5NWU4NmYzY2UwNjgzNjBkYzAw">“It feels so… expensive!” Amelia exclaimed, lifting the dress out of the box. “Help me put it on!” She stripped down to her undergarments and slipped into the dress. Serena had to help her with a dozen small ties, but it was soon done and Amelia gave a twirl to her girlfriend, who couldn’t take her crimson eyes off her spinning body.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTNkNjgyODA4ZTQ5MmU5NTg0NDE0MGU2ZGMzOWM3">“You like me in red, I take it?” She asked with a sly smile.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDc1MDIzY2ViOTQ4NzA5OWQ5Mjk0Njg4MTBjMmQy">“Obviously, idiot,” Serena approached her and pulled her into an embrace. “It’s so unfair…”</p>
<p class="cnNlNGI4YzI5NDJmMDRmMDRhYzlkZjgzOWQzMmJiMDhh">“What?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMzc0MDI0ZjA3MjQ2NjU5ZDU1NTBhNTMzNmRkN2Yz">“I spent all that time putting the dress on, and now I just want to rip it off you.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YTEzMGQ5Y2Q5ZDQ1OTA5NDVmZjRkZGIzOGEzMzg1">“Ha!” Amelia grinned. Every time Serena vocalised her desires like this, her heart would leap joyfully. “If you think about it, I’m your present… and you’ll be unwrapping me!” She gave her girlfriend a wink and got a blush in response.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTg3NWVkMzEyMTRkNzFiM2UxNzdjZTA5MWM3MzIx">Amelia glanced at the clock on the wall. “Are the markets still open?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNWU0YjBjNGRkZDRiY2ViOWVhY2U5ZTE4ODAzYjM1">“Should be, for another hour or so. Why?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMDQxMTAyZGEwODRmNzU5MzMzNzVlZTBmZWYzMDQx">“That’s not much time! Quick!” Amelia started removing the dress, and Serena happily helped her. “There’s something I want to get before the festival!” Once she was undressed, she put on a set of casual clothes and headed to the door.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmVmOTIyYTgyNzQwNDU5NTBkOTczYzA5NTI1M2Q5">“Don’t follow! It’s a present for the festival!” Amelia declared, pointing at Serena who made to follow her.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmRkMWQ3Y2E1ODQzMzVhY2Y3YzgxMGJjYjNhYTM4">“Every time you go somewhere alone, you get into trouble!” Serena huffed, crossing her arms. “If you’re going to buy something at the market, I can just get a coffee nearby or something.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYTg1MjVlNzAxYzRhZjE5Y2ZhYjUzMTQyNTZiOTcx">“Fine, but no looking! Promise?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ODI4NGU3MjVjYjRhNzY5Yzc5ZjY0Y2E3OThiMzBh">“Promise.”</p>
<p class="cnMyODBjMDM5YmJiOTQwMDFhN2JiYWIyN2EyOTBkYzg4">They donned their rainhats and raincoats and jumped the tram to Central. It was raining more often recently and the wind was stronger than usual.</p>
<p class="cnM3MjFmNTc3NDliMjQxODU5MWQ1YzU0M2ExODZkMjc0">“It’s the storm season,” Serena explained as her black hair was lifted by a gust of wind. “Soon, they’ll shut down civilian transport for about a month. The storms hitting the continent cause enough turbulence to rip apart a wooden transport.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMWZlOGIzYTExYjRjMzQ4ZGViMzk1YjcyNGZjODVh">“Will it stop us from sailing?”</p>
<p class="cnM5MDQxMDk2Y2M2ZTRkNWNiNWYyOWY5MmM1ZWM3MzA0">“No,” Serena said while shaking her head, “The <em>Vengeance</em> can handle all but the most serious storms. However, if the winds are strong enough, the light craft and sails attached to the hull could be ripped off and destroyed.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMjNiZWNmZDUyNzQyMjg5OWQwZTgyNzFiZTk3NDk5">As they neared their destination, Serena put an arm around Amelia’s waist and hopped off the tram. She couldn’t help but make a squeak of satisfaction. Being manhandled like that excited her in ways she didn’t quite understand. Besides, Serena seemed to enjoy manhandling her, so she would do anything she could to encourage the act.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTNlNmRiM2Q4NjRiMGU4YzU0OGI1MjNlNjkzMzIw">They arrived at the central market, and despite it being late, it was still extremely busy. Everyone seemed to want to buy their last-minute festival items, and Amelia was no different.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjc5ZmZhYWFlMDRlNGNhYjEwOWU3MDMxMjVjMzRl">“I’ll be sitting over there,” Serena gestured to a small cafe with outside seating at one edge of the marketplace. “Don’t get into any fights. Don’t Speak any Words. Don’t get yourself arrested. Don-”</p>
<p class="cnM1NDFhYWIxODA4YTQzM2NiNGYxNjhkYzBkNTc0NjQ5">“Yes, <em>Mother</em>,” Amelia rolled her eyes. “Stop worrying! I’ll be back soon. I just want to buy a few things!” She waved bye and vanished into the throng of shoppers. It didn’t take her long to find the kind of stall she wanted and despite the choice being a little less varied than she would have liked, she spent over a hundred denarii on various items.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjQ0YTJkN2RlYjQ2NzE5MGYyZmY2NTZlMjk1MjA0">She made sure they were wrapped up in a small bag so Serena wouldn’t see what they were before heading back and finding her girlfriend sipping coffee at a table. As she sat down Serena cast a questioning eye towards the bag.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTYxYWNkMzhiNzQyMzhhYzNhZmUyZDgzNTliZTE5">“You’ll find out tomorrow,” Amelia said, reaching over and taking a sip of Serena’s coffee. “Coffee this late?” She asked, enjoying the bitter aftertaste.</p>
<p class="cnM3OGY3MDI4NjQ2ZjRmOGE5NDIzMTcxYjRhNzhiYTNm">“I’m a captain,” Serena explained, “We run on coffee much like an airship runs on crystal and aether.” She took the drink back from Amelia and took a sip. “I think my tolerance is so high at this point it barely affects my sleep.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNjc2NTg4MWVmZjQwNzdiMGM4NmE5NmQ1NTFmY2Vk">“Of course,” Amelia said with a cheeky grin. “Now I’m the one keeping you awake, right?” She was delighted to see a tinge of redness appear on Serena’s face. It wasn’t as much as Serena would have blushed a few days ago. Like with the coffee, her girlfriend was becoming tolerant of her crass jokes.</p>
<p class="cnMxZmE5ZTU2ZWM5ZDRkMTI4MDNjNTQ1MzFlNWYxNGMy">Amelia would need to start stepping up her game.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTQ3NmM4YTc2NDQ1MzBiYTE0ODk4MjMyYjNjOTZi">“Tsk! We’ll have Aiden with us tomorrow, so we’ll need to keep our hands off each other while he’s with us.” Amelia puffed her cheeks out in response, prompting Serena to roll her eyes. Sure, they were <em>supposed</em> to keep their hands off each other in public, but once the pair of them had more than a few bottles of loqua how long would that rule last?</p>
<p class="cnMyNWExN2JhOThkNjQ0ZTY5NjQzOWFmZGUzMTlhYzc0">Besides, Aiden didn’t seem like the intolerant type.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzEyNWE3ZTBiNTQxMDVhYTZiYmM3NDkzZTkyOTg2">“How long is the festival?” Amelia asked.</p><span class="cjNiMmIyYTZjZjY3YTRmM2I4Njg2ZmUyOGMwZmI1ZGI0"><br/>If you encounter this tale on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlZmQ3MGNkNzAwMTQ1Nzc5NDBlZTBhZmJjZjQ2ZTFh">“The official start time is midday and it finishes at midnight. We’ll be joining the procession a little after lunch but won’t be following it for long. Aiden has a series of pubs he wants to visit as the day goes on. For many, the drinking will go on all night, but I’d rather retire a little after midnight. It wouldn’t do for a captain to get too drunk in public.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMWI1ZTg3ZmQ3NzQyNjE4YjEwYWVmMzg0NTkwYTU2">“What about Tomes and Dagon?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZmZkNjA5YjUxZjQzN2ZiMjNjNjRjNjczOGEwMTM5">“A captain doesn’t drink with their subordinates. I imagine most of the crew will be attending the festival, but it’s a big city. It’s unlikely we’ll bump into any of them.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTY2MTcyNjZiYTRkOGRhOGZkYmIzZDcwOGQ4MzYx">“Okay!” Amelia said cheerfully. She stole another sip of Serena’s coffee. The demon didn’t seem to mind, but Serena kept stealing glances at Amelia’s bag.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjA3ZDEwZjQzZTRmODViYjhlNDVmZGE5YWQ0NWI1">“I’m getting worried; what is it?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnNkOTJjMGYyMDQ0ZjQ1ODRhNGI3YjY2YzQwYjAyMzA1">“Wait until tomorrow!” Amelia hugged the bag close. “You won’t regret it, don’t worry. By the way, are you wearing a dress tomorrow? We ordered a pair of red dresses, but only one was delivered?”</p>
<p class="cnNlYjYxYzc1MTFhOTRjZDNhODJjZjY1NjBiNjc0ZjY0">“Right, they’re both for you,” Serena said, nodding. “A spare. I have a black dress for rare occasions. The last time I wore it was at my graduation party. I had it delivered from the ship to the inn a few days ago.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMGU3ZDgwZTA2ZDQxMzBhNGRkMDA2MWEyZGQxMDUz">“Oh…” Amelia played around with the image of Serena in a black dress in her mind. “We’re going to look amazing, aren’t we? Black and red? With a dash of blue…” Amelia thought about the blue and red masquerade masks. She couldn’t wait to see Serena wear hers.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDViODIxNTFlMDQ2NGFhYzNkNTYyNDlhYjgzMzQ2">The pair finished the coffee before heading back to the inn. It was evening now and the city was winding down. On the tram back Amelia could see city guards placing down signs which seemed to indicate no-drinking zones as well as directions for public toilets and lost pedestrians. The entire city was preparing for tomorrow.</p>
<p class="cnM3OWM3NWE3YWZhYzQwNDc4MTdhZDkwMzBhN2U3NDUz">Once they returned to the inn, Amelia lazed around waiting until bedtime while Serena meditated with her sword. Bored, she eventually shuffled up to the demon and began massaging her shoulders. Ignoring the complaints she moved to kissing Serena’s neck and as she felt the demon melt into her arms Amelia started groping her girlfriend and removing her clothes.</p>
<p class="cnMzYmEzNGVjZGJmNjQ5ZGU4ZmEzMTYxMjIwYzc4YjNi">“What are you doing now?” Serena said, her breath getting heavy.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTFiODRhNTJiODRjZjFiMjk4NmMyNTJiZWYzOWI5">“We won’t be able to touch each other much tomorrow? Half a day is far too long to expect me to resist.” Amelia turned Serena’s head towards her and gave her a deep kiss on the lips. “I think we should get as much of it out of our system as we can tonight, so tomorrow is bearable.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjU0MTQ4NDZmYzRkMGRiZmRlZTUyOGZmZWU4YWRi">“You idiot,” Serena mumbled before picking Amelia up and taking her to bed.</p>
<p class="cnNhMWFlODc0NTU1MzQ0YjY5ZWRlZjgzNzM3OTU3MzE4">That night, they didn’t get much sleep.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzQ4YTIyNDkyOTQ5Mjk5ZDE0ZWU4ZTQyOWY2YmVi"><br/><br/><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNmMDA2OWIzNjc4NzQ1NGE4YWEyNWY4MDI1ODljNDlh">The morning of the festival came and, like the previous mornings, Amelia started it by giving Serena and herself a generous blast of divine healing along with a touch of cleaning. Still, they both showered in the washroom as it felt weird not to.</p>
<p class="cnNiOTM1N2M0NTllMDRmNDZiZThjOTJkZTZjMTU3NDY2">Only, this time, Amelia followed Serena and despite her girlfriend raising an eye at her she didn’t say anything to stop her. The tub was an awkward size for two people so they took turns sitting on the ledge massaging the other’s shoulders while they sat under the falling water.</p>
<p class="cnM4MmVkMTkwOTc2NjRjMTE5ODU3OGM2MDRlNzExMTBl">They had slept in, only just catching breakfast before the kitchens closed. The inn was a flurry of activity as its inhabitants were all gearing up for the festival. A dozen guests had elaborate costumes, and some even seemed designed to be worn by multiple people. Serena explained that people would spend months making them not only to win competitions but also for the social aspect of doing an activity with friends and family.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTAzOGYxYjI4YTQ5NTg5MDAyZWI0MjFjNmU1M2Q5"><span style="font-weight: 400">That made sense to Amelia. In her world there was no end to easy entertainment. With a click of a button she could watch a show, listen to music, or play a game. Here that convenience didn’t exist, so she understood why a festival was such a big deal for the citizenry.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTQxOTA3NjgxYTQ2NmJhOTIxYjU5NGU5MzkxM2U1">They had both donned casual clothes. Serena told Amelia that the plan was to give Aiden their dresses to look after. When it got dark they would change and equip their masks. Until then, they had a pub crawl to survive. While they were waiting for Aiden in their room Amelia took her recently acquired marketplace acquisition and poured out the contents on the bed.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWFhYjIzMTdmODQwNjZhOGZkZDg1YTRiOGJlZDc3">“Really?” Serena asked, tilting her head with an amused smile.</p>
<p class="cnNkZWY2NzFiZTY3ZTRjNDk4YmRlZDc4YTY2NTQ0YjU4">“You have such <em>pretty</em> horns, it’ll be a shame for them to go unadorned,” Amelia explained pointedly, “Now let’s start with these….” She motioned for Serena to sit down and her girlfriend obliged with a sigh. Amelia placed the two horncaps on Serena’s horns. The tips were studded with glowing crystal and long tassels with gems woven into the fabric shone like little stars.</p>
<p class="cnMyMzg5MDdkNTA5YTRkYTdhZDI3ZGE2NGU5OWM2YjFm">Amelia started wrapping the tassels around the horns in a spiral pattern. Once she was done she used a hornband to secure it in place. “See!?” Amelia handed Serena a hand mirror so she could appreciate the handiwork.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDgwOGQ4NTI2YTQ2ZWFhNjIzMDVlMDY5OWU5OWQ4">“I look like one of those warning cones they put around heavy machinery,” Serena said, meeting Amelia’s gaze in the reflection.</p>
<p class="cnMzM2U2YzJkNDc0NTQxYzFiOTZkMjgyYzI1MzY4OWRh">“Shut up! You look amazing!” Amelia rolled her eyes and began attaching the remaining hornbands she had purchased. While she was doing that, Serena picked up the other items Amelia had purchased.</p>
<p class="cnMwMjNlMzdiZGUyOTQxMTJiZDkxMDMwNTZmMmFmMzlj">“Earrings?” She asked, holding up the gold jewellery encrusted with glowing blue moon crystals. “Two pairs? How much did this cost?”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTgzYzUxOGZmMTQ5M2Y4Y2EwMmNhOTQxNTYyOGI4">“Enough that you’ll disapprove,” Amelia murmured as she secured the final hornbands. “But not as much as I was willing to spend if I found nicer ones!”</p>
<p class="cnNmNTIzMjJmNTM5MjRlY2ZiZDkyMjUxMzIyYzg2MDIz">“Pfft!” Serena giggled, holding a hand to her mouth.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjBlMTRjZDY4YjRhOWViMDgwOWVjMjM2OGE3ZmFm">“What’s so funny?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OWYwNzRmOWE0MjRlZGY5MjczMTZkZDlmODNmYzRj">“One thing my father liked about me was how frugal I was with my allowance growing up. Unlike my youngest sister, who spends money as fast as she can be given it, I bought practical clothes and simple food.” Serena turned around to face Amelia. “Who knew to experience that lifestyle, all I needed to get was a girlfriend who’d spoil me?”</p>
<p class="cnNkN2QzNjZjYWJmZTQyNGI4ZWRhZGY0ZTg4YmJkOGE3">“Hmrph!” Amelia crossed her arms and moved her face closer to Serena’s. “Well, it’s basically your money anyway, right? You’re the one paying me! Besides,” she flicked her eyes to Serena’s lips, “You could pay me nothing, and I’ll stay by you. I don’t care about your money when I have your heart!” She felt her own cheeks flush at the last sentence but kept her composure. Her discipline was well rewarded as she got to once again enjoy an embarrassed Serena looking awkwardly away while trying not to smile too much.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTVmM2U1NTNiOTRmZDg5MjBhNzQxZDlmZGNkYThm">“Idiot, saying such unnecessary things…” Serena mumbled. Amelia darted in for a quick kiss before pulling back with a cheeky grin.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDY0OWFjNzBiNjQ4MDliOTM2ZDgxZmQ4YzIyM2I0">“It’s <em>very necessary</em> for me, I assure you. Here, let me put these on,” She took the earrings from Serena’s hands and clipped them onto the demon's ears and Serena did the same back to her. It felt weird having the weight of wealth hang from her ears. She shook her head a few times, enjoying the weird feeling pulling on her ears.</p>
<p class="cnNjNGFkMTM1YWI4MDQ3OWY5OTAwZTVkNDE1ZTZhODJm">A knock sounded at the door and the two glanced at each other before scrambling up. “Who is it?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjFlNWFjODllOTQ3Njg5ZThiNGVkYmJlMmRjODg3">“Your best friend, carrying his best friend in his hands!” Aiden’s cheerful voice was slightly muffled through the door. “Can I come in?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNzQ0MzdiNmU0YzRmOThhYjQ1ZjIyZGZhNDE1YWFh">Serena strode over, opening the door to reveal a smart-looking Aiden. He wore black trousers and a white shirt. His horns were painted with the colours of the moon. In one hand, he held a bag, and in the other, a bottle of beer.</p>
<p class="cnMxMWQ3ZGM4OTY3YTQ1ZDk5MTA5ZTc0MTY3ZGIyN2Q5">“Your best friend?” Serena asked, eyeing the bottle. “You need better friends, Aiden The Drunk.”</p>
<p class="cnMyZDI4MmE4NzhkOTRlNzQ5MjZkN2Y1MTBiYWJkMzYw">“I have two wonderful,” he gestured to the room with a flourish, “And beautiful friends right here. However! Since you so <em>strongly</em> insisted I could not make our trio any bigger I am left with making <em>this</em> my third friend…” Aiden lifted the bottle, frowning as he examined the label, “... <em>Demon’s Delight</em>. How fruity and crisp you taste today, dear friend!”</p>
<p class="cnM0YjFiZDliMTcyYzQ3YmU4MzFiYzhiY2U3M2NiYjky">Amelia giggled and Serena rolled her eyes. “Can I try it?” Amelia asked. She was able to smell the beer from here but couldn’t quite identify the familiar fragrance.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzgxMjdmMjUzYTQzMWE5NjliMWZiODMxYTE1YWU4">“Aha!” Aiden exclaimed. “I knew you wouldn’t be such a bore. Here,” he fished about in the bag and pulled out another bottle of <em>Demon’s Delight</em>, “I brought another with me. Try it while we go over the plans I’ve made for today!” Aiden handed Amelia a bottle and she fiddled around with the top before opening it with a satisfying pop. The bottles she had seen all used flip-top style caps instead of the usual crown cork she was familiar with in her world.</p>
<p class="cnM5Zjc3YzRhYzIwMTQ0MTBhMGIyNDlhODU0MjFlMjNh">“Where’s mine?” Serena said, crossing her arms in disapproval.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTU1N2U2ZjY1OTQ5N2Y4YzIyM2U5NjUyNmZlNDI1">“I drank it on the way,” Aiden said with a shrug, “You know how it is.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOGMyOGRmMWE2MTQzNjE4Y2Y1ZWQzYTFhZjUxNzYw">While Serena admonished Aiden, Amelia took a swig of her bottle. The beer was light and fruity, and there were hints of something similar to strawberry and banana. “Mmm!” She exclaimed, taking another sip. Aiden had picked something good to start the day off!</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmQyY2Y0OTA1NDQ5MGU4ZTdhOTczMDNiYzEyMmY0">“Hic!” Amelia covered her mouth in embarrassment. Her noise caused the other two to stop arguing and stare at her. “It’s good!” She exclaimed, taking another sip. “Hic!”</p>
<p class="cnMwMTAxYTQ0M2Q1NDRjOGE4MzQ4Mjc5NTJhZDdkMjVm">“Give me that,” Serena said, striding over and taking the bottle from her hands. The demon took a swig, then another, before fetching two cups and decanting the beer into them. The three of them gathered around the table while Aiden took them through the day's plans.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjQ3OGNhNjU2YjQzMjM5YjQ3OTc2ZTgwNjdhNGVm">“Right, we’re going to keep it simple,” Aiden explained, “We’ll follow one of the processions for an hour, then duck into Beer Lane until it gets dark-”</p>
<p class="cnM4N2Q5ZWM1ZGU1ODQ0YTQ5YzRmM2IxNzQyY2Y4NThl">“Beer Lane?” Amelia asked, suppressing another hiccup.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGUxNzcxOWMzZDQ0NDQ4OTIxZmZlYTc3ZjJlNjcy">“Literally a street full of pubs,” Serena said, “Aiden’s dream come true.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNjdkYzNmOTQwYTRlNjBiZDM4YmQ4ZWEyZDQ2MmRm">“We’ll work our way through that holy ground,” Aiden continued with a smile on his face, “And then we’ll get some food before heading to a pagoda viewing room I booked to witness the main ceremony.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YWZjN2ZkMjE5MDQyNDRhMGM4MDlkZDVhYzFkOWFl">“You booked a pagoda room?” Serena asked with a raised eyebrow, “How’d you afford that?”</p>
<p class="cnMxYmJjN2E0ZTgzYzQ0YmRhMDY0MjM3NjliNTY5MmI1">“Pulled some horns,” Aiden said with a grin, “Part of the expenses I can claim for this mission to profile our wonderful human friend,” Aiden tilted his head in her direction and tapped his horns. It was an action Amelia had seen a number of times now and she figured it was a similar mark of respect to tipping your hat.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjNhZmQ5NzExYzQ1MzJhMzc1YzExMmI5MTVmZmUy">Aiden stored their dress clothes in his bag and they finished the <em>Demon’s Delight</em> before leaving the inn. Aiden led them through the streets towards the main road. As they got closer, the sound of music and drums could be heard and when they turned the final corner Amelia was greeted by a kaleidoscope of colour and sound.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDI2YzEzYjUxMDRkMWNhZGI1ZDAxNGFlOTQ2YmVk">Hundreds of demons and humans walked, danced and skipped past them while laughing and drinking. Every other person wore an elaborate costume representing a kami, while the rest wore colourful jewelry on their horns and ears. Many wore facepaint and some had even gone topless with their bodies painted with colourful patterns.</p>
<p class="cnNmNGE1OWM2ZDlkZTRkMGNiOTlkNTFkMTA5Mjg5N2My">Most walked in small groups of friends but often there were those that were coordinated in their formation as they danced and twirled while waving flags and batons. People walked along playing trumpets and stringed instruments while others played large drums strapped to their bodies. The rythmic sounding of the drums lifted the spirits of everyone as the atmosphere of the festival soaked into their senses.</p>
<p class="cnM5NTViYjMyNDJhYzQ5NDI4NGI0Y2I2ODEwY2JlZGY1">“Let’s go, let’s go!” Amelia exclaimed, and before anyone responded, she skipped into the throng of festival goers and twirled about as she followed the hundreds of people progressing up the road. Her heart sang with joy as she felt her happiness grow as she saw how much fun everyone around her was having.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTFkNmE4YzE4NDQxMjU5MmQ0YWY4NGVjNjdlMmI3">It didn’t matter how she came to this world, whether she died or was brought by something against her will. <em>This</em> made it all worth it. <em>This</em> was an experience she would remember for the rest of her life. Right now, she was doing everything she had wished she could do when she spent years lying in that hospital bed. She was dancing, twirling and drinking without a care in the world.</p>
<p class="cnM4MmRiNjVlNjM5NzRkYmE5ZWIxNDVhNDU4YmZhNDJl">At least until her revelling was stopped by Serena grabbing her wrist.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTIxODRiNWYxMDQ5ZmNiMWQzMDcyMTk1ZTRmNGVl">“You’re making me dizzy,” Serena said with a gentle smile.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTBhNGQzNzQ1MTRlNGU4NTkyNTRmYmU5ZWQzODkw">“Do you want to dance?” Amelia asked, “I can see everyone’s doing the same kind of skipping dance thing - I’m trying to learn it!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NWMyYjczZTlkYTQwNGZhZjFkMDUyYmFmMGNmZTBm">“I’ll dance later,” Serena said, “I need to drink more before I can move like you do, and besides…” She trailed off, and Amelia tilted her head in confusion. “I’m enjoying just watching you for now…” The demon’s crimson eyes twinkled.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjc0MjIyNGE0NDQwZDlhY2IwMGQ3MjFkNzA1NzQ3">“Why’ve we stopped?” Aiden said, appearing from the side. “Look, there’s a stall over there doing face painting. Wanna get it done as a group? I might get a <em>shawa</em> face.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NGM0ZWQ5NTIyOTQ3M2Q4MGJhMWIyZDc2MDU5MmY5">“What’s that?” Amelia asked, “<em>Shawa?</em>”</p>
<p class="cnNmMGIzN2VhMDZlMDRlY2Q4MDY1NDE1NDA5MDY1YTYx">“A bigger <em>peeka</em>,” Serena explained, holding her palm flat at about Amelia’s shoulders. “Very big, and instead of licking you, they eat you.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MWFiNTkyNWRiOTRmYTVhMDVkMjI2NGE5MjZkZmQz">“<em>Peeka!</em> Can I get a <em>peeka</em> face done? Please!? You as well!” Amelia pointed to Serena and then herself, “We can match! Come on!” Not caring if Aiden saw or not, she grabbed Serena’s hand and dragged her to the stall.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTVjNTUzYzZiYTRjOGQ5NTc1ODkxNDM5MTg0OTU2">Tonight was all about <em>fun</em>.</p>

      <description>Chapter Twenty-Seven: A Good Show</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM0YTAxMzE0OWM5NzQ5Y2Y4MzIzZDMwOGUwMTFlYzVk"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNmOGQ2YzFiYTdjMDRhOGI5MDMwNzdmMWUyZDQ1MWU1">When Serena turned and showed Amelia her painted <em>peeka</em> face it was only the result of a titanic amount of self-control and the presence of Aiden that prevented her from blurting out something entirely inappropriate.</p>
<p class="cnMzNmVhMWIyYWIwZDQyNjk4MjhhZTY2MmFmNWE4NTVj">While she bit her tongue to stop giggling with enough force to crush a warrior wrapped in orange aura, Amelia was delighted to see that Serena seemed to be facing the same predicament.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTRjNGI3OTc0ZDRmMjdiNDU2OTRkYzgxNzk5YzYy">“Look at you two,” Aiden said, as the finishing touches were made to his painted <em>shawa</em> face, “I’m king of the forest! You can be members of my pack! Here,” Aiden offered them another beer from his bag, “You can share some of my kill!”</p>
<p class="cnNlODE4NjUyN2Q0ZjQ0NzQ5ZTFlZjI5ZDM2NzRiYzcz">“King of the drunks, more like,” Serena said, turning her mirth-filled gaze from Amelia’s face and towards Aiden before snatching the bottle.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzg4ZGIyN2I2ZTQ1NGNhMTM2ODI5NzBlNjI5MmE5">“Do <em>shawas</em> and <em>peekas </em>hunt in packs?” Amelia asked, not quite able to imagine the lion-like <em>shawa</em> with a pack of <em>peekas</em>. The latter seemed even more friendly than the domesticated housecats from her world.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzA5NWI4NDMxODRiMzI5NWEyMGU5ZmM2NzNmYTNl">“No, they’ll get eaten,” Serena said, crossing her arms while a sly smile appeared. “I’d like to see this idiot try anything like that with either of us!” The cheerful threat was slightly dampened coming from a face with an adorable <em>peeka</em> painted on it, but it was enough to make Aiden throw his hands up in mock surrender.</p>
<p class="cnNmM2M0OTk2MzMyYjQ3MzM5MDgyYzA2NDAxZjU4NGUw">They finished up and the three of them continued following the procession for a while. Amelia was getting the hang of the strange energetic dance that everyone was doing and even managed to get Serena to briefly join in on the part where you link elbows and spin. She suspected Serena was a little shy to dance in public. Perhaps it was the lack of alcohol or the presence of Aiden that held her back.</p>
<p class="cnMwN2JmNGFlZmE5MTRjODBiNzIxODcxOTBjNWEyNjUz">The rhythmic beating of drums and the symphony of celebration carried them through the streets. There were stalls set up on the sides from which Aiden would constantly restock his bag of alcohol and would make sure neither her or Serena were lacking refreshment.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWMzNGUzMTdkZTRkOTZiOGU4NDUzZmM1YjY1NmI3">The air was humid and despite the constant breeze of storm season it was rather warm. Whenever Aiden handed out a beer she would agitate her aether and cool it down with a bit of ice magic, something he and Serena very much appreciated.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjAxZTk0ZGIwMzQzY2U4NTVhNzgzNTk1M2I0Y2Fj">A few more minutes passed before Aiden pulled them out of the main procession and into a side street that seemed even more packed. “Welcome!” He announced, spinning and throwing his arms wide. “To the holy ground!”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTMyNjNjZTQ3ZDQxY2Q4NjljMjdiMTBmNTIwZDRi">The side street stretched into the distance as far as Amelia could see and on either side, waves of people - demon and human alike - flowed as they entered and exited the hundreds of establishments lining the street. Every few seconds, Amelia’s enhanced hearing could make out the shattering of glass or someone falling over.</p>
<p class="cnM4NWYxNTdiYzkyMzQyYjQ5YTBiOTI5NjE5NWEwZDk1">“Seven Hells,” Serena muttered, “It’s worse than I thought.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjJiOTU3MTkwNTQxZmZiZDI2ZDM5MzVhMWM2N2Y1">“Don’t worry, dear friend!” Aiden bent forward in a traditional Manwese bow, “I have selected a dozen of the finest establishments in our path! You won’t be disappointed; I can promise you that!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNGQyZjgwOTA5MDQ4OWY4MTEwMTAzMTM0MzJiYjdi">And so, the pub crawl truly began.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTllYjNjNTU2MTQ2YmQ5MzdlNjUyZTIzMjJhOTI5">Aiden led them from one pub to the next, spending no longer than half an hour in each one. To his credit, he had picked establishments where they often had their own cubicle or private drinking area. It seemed he had thoroughly planned the night to the extent of booking ahead.</p>
<p class="cnNiNThjYmE3M2FiZDRkM2Q4YWQ0NzEyYWFhMTJjOGQ2">He took Serena and Amelia through a range of drinks. Beers, ales, lagers and stouts which Amelia was told were a particular favourite of demonkind. She lifted up the glass of dark liquid with a layer of foam, examining it before giving it a sip.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTg5ZGFhMGU0MDRkNDFhY2Q4NTZkZTdlM2UwMGZh">“I’m not sure how,” she said before taking another sip of the stout, “But it somehow tastes <em>heavy</em>. Is that a thing? It’s good, though!” She enjoyed the feeling of the cool liquid flowing down her throat.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjYzZmE2YTVjZjQ2ODM5NzljYjg3NjgzMjg1NGNj">“Aha!” Aiden exclaimed while bending over and digging through his bag. While he was distracted, Serena leaned over and wiped Amelia’s upper lip with her thumb.</p>
<p class="cnNhYWRjODVmN2NjODRmYTA4MzU4YzRhOWVlM2U2ODk1">“Foam,” Serena whispered with a smile and a twinkle in her eye before licking it off her thumb. Her eyes told Amelia everything she needed to know, and as Aiden straightened up, Amelia innocently reached under the table and squeezed Serena’s thigh.</p>
<p class="cnNmOGI5ZDIxODRiOTQ5ZjA4NDQ1YWUxNTU2ODlmOTZk">“What’s that?” Amelia asked at the notebook Aiden had produced. Under the table Serena had placed her own hand on top of Amelia’s but made no attempt to remove it. Amelia kept her hand where it was, enjoying the contact. It wasn’t the first time they had gotten intimate while Aiden’s attention was elsewhere.</p>
<p class="cnNhNDNmYjRmYzM3NTQyMTA4YWMyMDlmODdmYTg3Yjgx">“This, my human friend, is the record of my life!” Aiden proudly declared while flicking through the notebook.</p>
<p class="cnMzZGIwNjg5YjdhMjRiNjU5ZTkyZDNiNGQ5ODg3YTFk">“You’re still writing that? Christ…” Serena rolled her eyes. “It’s his record of alcohol he’s tried,” She explained to Amelia, “Aiden wants to write a book about it one day. It was the goal he decided on when quitting the sword in the academy.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYmRiNTVmNjYyNDQxMTBhZDgyNjQxNGQ1YWYzNmEx">“Yes, yes,” Aiden chirped, waving his hand dismissively, “Now, what was this called…” He examined the stout that Amelia was drinking, “...<em>Ironwood Forest</em>. Perfect.” He scribbled a few lines of imperial in his notebook before turning his eyes to Amelia. “You described it as <em>heavy</em>, yes? Anything else? The more descriptive, the better!”</p>
<p class="cnM0ODY0ZDUyY2MyODRjZDQ5Nzk4YTg5ZjIwMWIxMzlm">“Umm…” Amelia took another sip of the stout. “It’s bitter, but not unpleasantly so. It has a strong aftertaste of iron that lingers for quite a while. It’s, uh… <em>rich</em> in flavour.” She struggled to be more colourful in her description. Mathematics was always her strong suit.</p>
<p class="cnM5NWIxODkwNjhhOTQzMmJiOTM0NzIyYmRmNDQyM2U1">“And how would you rate it?”</p>
<p class="cnNhOGRkY2Q1YjU0NzRkODE4YTJmZTQ5MmE0MDg0MzA1">“Four stars?” Amelia offered, thinking it over. “Maybe four-and-a-half stars? Out of five, that is. What?” She asked, noticing Aiden and Serena were looking at her in confusion.</p>
<p class="cnNmYWUzZGZjZjgyNTQ2ZmI5MTBjZTBhNWIyMDk2MTRh">“Stars?” Aiden asked.</p>
<p class="cnM3NGQwNjM5ODViODQ3YjJiYWI1ZWZiNzRmNzM4Mjgz">“Umm… yeah?”</p>
<p class="cnNhYTc3MjYxZjg2MjQxMWE4MzQwNWZmMWQ2YTk5N2Nj">“Why would you rate something based on stars?” He asked with a frown. Amelia felt Serena squeeze her hand under the table.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODk3OGE1ZDljMTQzZGI4YWVlZTg2ZGRkOTAxODA4">“It's just something that we did back in Karligard,” Amelia said nonchalantly. “I never thought about why. It's probably some tradition or something,” she shrugged dismissively. “What do you usually use to rate things?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MzFkMTE2NDcwYTQzZTNhMWE1OTkzMTA3OGM2OTA3">“Well, the <em>moons,</em> obviously,” Aiden said, pointing upwards. “Five moons sit above Cascadian land so typically we would rate something out of <em>five moons</em>. Hmm…” He scratched his chin with a thoughtful expression. “Four-and-a-half moons it is.” Aiden scribbled her commentary into his notebook.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDQwNjEzYTVjMjQ5YTBiNWI5NGU0OTBkMzc2ZDhj">They finished up and headed to the next establishment and then the next. Amelia got to try a wide range of flavours and alcohol. There was <em>The Gravedigger’s Horns</em> which had strong, earthy tones while a pale ale called <em>Six Heavens</em> tasted like peaches. It turned out cider was also popular in Cascadia although Amelia found that just like in her own world it wasn’t to her taste.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2UwNjc2OTc1YzRlZTNiZWQxNGYwOTBlZWMxMDJh">As the hours ticked by, the bottles of alcohol got stronger and stronger and as the night sky darkened they had moved on to fortified wine. Amelia felt pleasantly drunk and she was sure Serena was becoming just a little wobbly as well. As the alcohol took hold of the pair, Amelia had slowly ignored their pre-arranged boundaries and sat closer and closer to Serena. Now, as the empty-bottle of fortified wine was replaced with another Amelia let herself lean ever so slightly against her girlfriend.</p>
<p class="cnM0YjgxNDRiZWRhNTQ0OTZiMDdhODM0YzM5ZTEyN2Yy">“Keeping warm?” Aiden asked with a grin.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2M4NGYxY2NmMjQwYmU4ZjA2YTQ2MDJkY2UxMzQy">“Tsk! She’s just-” Serena began, a note of panic in her voice.</p>
<p class="cnNiYjhhZmVmMmUyZDQ1NGQ4YTRkNTVlMTI5NDY2ZDRm">“Right, I get you.” Aiden interrupted.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDk4NjgyMDhmYzQzODRhNTdiNjFiODg4MjUzN2Rk">“It’s just the-”</p>
<p class="cnM4NTEwZWU1ZGVjOTQ3ODBiYWU1ZThiZTgzZGMyMTg4">“Yes yes, very much so.” Aiden said with a twinkle in his eye. An awkward silence descended for a moment and Amelia heard Serena swallow.</p>
<p class="cnM5MWE2ZTc5MWQ0NzQ0ZjliYzZkOTczMGNkNmY4MmFh">“Guess it’s not exactly a secret anymore, right?” Serena asked, “When did you… you know…”</p>
<p class="cnM3MWJjMDE4YWJiZDRjYzM5OTA3ODY2ZjFlZWRlOWEx">“Figure it out? Hmm…” Aiden raised a finger, “Suspected it by the end of the first training session,” a second finger was raised, “Confirmed by the end of the third. Didn’t take amazing detective skills to watch you two undress each other with your eyes every time you looked at each other. And also…” Aiden lowered his voice until it was barely audible, “One of our agents saw you two groping each other on the tram. They said-” He was interrupted by Serena’s loud groan as she leaned forward and grabbed her horns in anguish.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzVhMGQwMDFmZTQ4N2ViZGY0MTU3OGMxMGY1ODlj">Amelia giggled and began rubbing her girlfriend’s back sympathetically. “We thought we were being so careful!” she said cheerfully, “You don’t mind, do you Aiden?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNTM3YzU0ZTgyMjQwYzg5OTgyNGVjMzQ4OWJiMmIw">The demon shrugged. “I don’t care too much either way. It’s a bit unusual to see a demon and a human but it’s not unheard of. Happens all the time in the Sabanis Dominance. Serena was always one to make her own path through life. The only downside is I’ve lost my evening entertainment…”</p>
<p class="cnM3N2Y1YWU2NGVlNjRmNTdiODU0MDJhMjljN2RhYjY1">“Evening entertainment? What do you mean?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjE1N2JkNDE1MzRhMGY5ZDU0NTM1NzdiMTUyYzQz">“Watching you two drunk fools think you’re being subtle, feeling each other up under the table,” Aiden said with a grin, prompting Serena to groan loudly again and squeeze her horns tighter. In response, Amelia increased the back rubs tremendously. “Yeah, don’t think I haven’t noticed. I’m not a member of Cascadian Intelligence for nothing!” He gestured to himself proudly with his thumb.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTk3MTI2ZWM2YTRhYmM4MWM3OGI3OTc3ZmRhOWVk">Amelia leaned over and embraced the crumpled heap of her girlfriend. She looked across the table at Aiden. “Doesn’t The Bible speak out against… you know?” She punctuated her statement by giving Serena a gentle squeeze.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2IzNjJiNDU1MDQzM2NiMDM5OWMwZmYzYzFlMTVl">“Sure,” Aiden said, looking amused. “But things were <em>very different</em> back then. The scripture the Empress constructed from the teachings of Christ himself - the greatest demon to ever walk the realms - was done when demonkind was facing an extinction event. How much do you know about how Cascadia was formed?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMTg4YTI3ZjRiODQ4OTY4YmJiYzExMTJhMTY4Mjgz">“Tomes gave me a brief overview.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjRmOTRmMTVmODRmMjc5MDUxNDM5MzQzYmQ4YjNj">“Who’s Tomes?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjRhOTVlZmI2MDQ4ZmM5NjA2ODM2OTdkYTIxZTkz">“The quartermaster on the <em>Vengeance</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM4YzEyZDA3ODdiODQ5YTNiM2U4OTM2YTM0MDJkYjAz">“Right. At the height of the long discordance, when human and demonkind were scrambling to survive on the plateaus and mountaintops, it was bad, <em>really bad</em>,” Aiden jabbed a finger into the table, “Historians argue about the exact number, but most settle on around two-hundred thousand.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMzY5NmYwNTY4NTQzM2U4YmVmZWU4YjkzMjc2OTQ3">“Two-hundred thousand what?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnM3ODllYzljNTUyMTRhZDliNWNhNTFiNGY4OTlmNmIy">“Two-hundred thousand demons remaining. Of our entire species. That’s how close we came to extinction in this realm. That’s why in most religious scripture, whether it’s the Quinto scrolls here in Kenhoro, the diaries of Sangoism, or the etchings made by the stone-worshippers in Honkanai, they <em>all</em> emphasise the need for demonkind to procreate.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2M4NTQzODhmNzRjYzBiMTI4MDgwODQ5NTMzNzY2">“Of course, such things matter less now. The Centralis Basin is home to some eighty million demons, and the rest of the territories have millions more. Still, the scriptures that prohibit or discourage same-sex relationships had good reason to do so,” Aiden shrugged as he opened the bottle of fortified wine, “Just many others like myself understand that reason no longer exists. Like I said, I don’t care either way. I think-”</p><span class="cjY3NGZiMjQ5Yjk3ODQ3N2ZhNTY2ZDc2ZDJmMGMxMGVm"><br/>If you stumble upon this tale on Amazon, it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1YzcxYmMyMDUyYTQ5NTA5MzkwMmVlMzM1MDVkN2Yx">“Can we keep drinking, please?” Serena mumbled from within Amelia’s arms.</p>
<p class="cnM4NGZjMzU4Y2JkZDQ4ZDVhMmMyNmRkMDIyNTRiMGM0">“Ah! She’s resurrected!” Aiden said with a triumphant smile. “Look, Amelia! Her cheeks are as red as the red moon! Ah, young love!” Amelia gave her girlfriend a soft smile and she swore she could feel the heat radiating from those burning cheeks. “Look what I got!” Aiden pointed to the set of three strangely-shaped glasses on the table.</p>
<p class="cnNkOTdjOWIxZGJiMzQxODRhNzBlYzcwMmEwMTJjYmM4">“Oh dear,” Serena said.</p>
<p class="cnNiYmEyYzEzYmRmZjRiMDA5MTU0Zjc4N2NjZjJjNWJl">“What are these?” Amelia asked, picking one up. The glass had no stem and only two small glass protrusions to balance itself on. At the bottom, a long hollow stem curved upwards from which the contents could easily spill out.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2Q2NGQ0ODEzMTRhNTA4MTZiZGUyNjczYTkzZjFl">“These are <em>sipper</em> glasses,” Serena explained. “They’re designed to be easy to tip over, so the drinker is inclined to constantly hold them, and the long stem encourages spillage.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NGUwOTQwNzBlMzRkNWE5ZjJhN2MzZjY1YTg3Njky">“Okay… why?” Amelia asked, happy to see Serena functioning again.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTdkZTg2MDkwOTRjZGE5ODUyMjg0ZWIyNmVmMzZi">“Because it encourages the holder to <em>keep drinking,</em>” Serena said, putting an arm around Amelia and pulling her close. “And I suddenly feel <em>very </em>determined to get <em>very</em> drunk. So come on then, <em>Aiden The Drunk.</em> Live up to your name!”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTI0ZTIwNzc1MDQ3Yzc4YjAzMmYwMzZlOTBiMjZl">“It’s <em>Aiden The Drinker</em>…” Aiden mumbled before decanting the fortified wine into the sipper glasses. The three of them sat in silence for a minute, enjoying their alcohol. Amelia turned slightly and leaned against Serena. No longer needing to try and pretend that they weren’t in a relationship, Amelia felt like she could truly relax.</p>
<p class="cnM2NzkwY2NlODE0MTRiYTY4MGIzNjg5OTVmZDY1Zjdj">“Tell me a story,” Amelia asked the pair of demons.</p>
<p class="cnNiMGU2MWUwNzQ5MTQ5ZTBhODE0ZDFhM2YzYWRjNDkx">“About what?” Aiden replied.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDY1N2I1N2I1ZjQ2NTQ5MTFlNWQ4NDk1YjI2Mzc2">“About Serena at the academy! Was she always, you know…” Amelia made slashing and stabbing motions with her hand. She didn’t need to turn around to know Serena was rolling her eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjYxNWVjMDRiMTRmNzk5YWM3OTFlMTQ0ZjlkNGMx">“You bet your pretty horns she was!” Aiden declared with a grin before frowning, “Uh, you don’t have horns… you know what I mean, though! There was that time she attacked an instructor…”</p>
<p class="cnM4MWMzZDFkZWQwZDRhOWY5YzEwZGQ4OWRmOTBmNjJm">“I <em>did not</em> attack an instructor. It was a <em>mutual </em>duel!” Serena protested while Amelia giggled.</p>
<p class="cnNiODliNGM5NTE5ZDQ1Yzg5Nzc3YWIyNjAxOWMyNGVl">“And then there was that time she broke the nose of a poor boy who just wanted to dance with her…”</p>
<p class="cnNkMDJiZGJlMGI5MzQ3ZDE4Njc4MGQ3MjZhYzIzMTcy">“Tsk! That idiot thought just because his father was a lord, I would fall head over heels with him. It was his fault for pushing it so much!”</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2ZmMTQ1ZThkZDQyMmY5YmIxZDI2Mjk1NjMyNzNl">“Well,” Amelia said, “I can see her etiquette lessons have been <em>consistent</em> in their nature throughout the years.” She tilted her head backwards to make out a red-faced Serena. Whether she was blushing from the alcohol or the stories, Amelia didn’t know.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmM2MjFlNDg5MjQyOTg4NmY1NDNiYzcwM2ZkNjE3">“Remember what we did with Jorge of Jark?” Aiden piped up.</p>
<p class="cnNlNGY4OTM0N2QxYTQ3MWFhOWM2ODBlMGQ5MzNlN2Mx">“Ha!” Amelia felt her body shift as Serena laughed, “That was a good one! He even thanked us at the end, didn’t he?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMmQ5YTEwM2FlZDRjODM4MGMzZjk3YjdkYzBjYmVl">“Who’s Jorge of Jark?” Amelia asked, “And what did you do to him? Oops,” A sudden feeling of wetness on her chest as she spilt some fortified wine from her sipper glass. A quick invocation of a cleaning spell and the stain was gone.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWExY2EzZDQyODQ5ZDA5OGZkN2MyNzY0YzkxNTcz">Amelia had been abusing the spell throughout the night to avoid the need for either her or Serena to visit the washroom. She hadn’t been casting it on Aiden to create as many situations as possible where they would have a few minutes alone.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDg2Yjc1YTY4MDRiNjQ5ZjZiN2IxMzE3NGVjYjFl">“Jorge was a swordsman from the North,” Aiden explained, “He had talent but would paralyse himself with self-criticism, you see. The man came from humble beginnings and was hoping to graduate and earn enough to send some money back to his family.”</p>
<p class="cnM0YzAxNDgwZmM5MDQzYThiOWU1N2Q5YWEzYzI0NDFm">“That’s right,” Serena said, “Other than his lack of self-confidence, he was a decent demon. Seemed to treat everyone the same, which some of the sons and daughters of lords took exception to.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNjIxZWFiNjVlODRlY2M4OGNmZGJmNWNhNmQzYWU5">“And not you?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDE4NTM1MGU4NTQ1YzI4NTE5N2Q2NmQ0MWIwNzUz">“I didn’t care where anyone came from in the academy. Our group consisted of demons from all levels of society.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NTMwN2Y1OTJhMjQ2Yzc5MGZhMTFmMzNiNDNmMzhm">“You had a friendship group?”</p>
<p class="cnNmZTI4NzE1N2FiYjRkYzA5MGI5ZTc0MGQ4ZGMwNTU5">“It was more… a training group,” Serena said with a shrug, “It was only idiots like this,” she gestured to Aiden, spilling some of her fortified wine on the table, “Who were persistent enough to maybe be considered a friend…”</p>
<p class="cnMyMDI3OTBlMzdmNDQwNmVhNWE3ZDk1OGZiNDFkM2Jj">“I knew behind those crimson eyes and the trail of broken bones and bloodied noses that there was a caring demon!” Aiden exclaimed, “And look! Here we are!” He motioned to Amelia as she leaned against her girlfriend.</p>
<p class="cnM4MzJlMzNlMGNiNzQ0ZTJiZGY4Y2I0ZDQzNDQ4Zjg3">“I know, right!?” Amelia nodded enthusiastically, “She’s a big softy, isn’t she?”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjc1YjVkNGEzNjQ3N2Y4ZTZhNDhiMTcxYTcyYWJi">“I’ll show you soft…” Serena mumbled quietly as she took another sip.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmQ2NWJkOWE0YjQxOGY5MDZhZGY3NjUwYjBjNmVh">“So what did you do with Jorge, then?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTk2N2MwODlmNjRhNmM5ODE1NTNkMzQwODEwOGZl">“So he didn’t have much self-confidence but would hang around and train with us. Jorge seemed to struggle with pushing himself, despite wanting to. It was like a mental barrier was blocking him,” Aiden leaned in with a mischievous glint in his eye, “We noticed he was using a variable training sword, you see.”</p>
<p class="cnMwOWE3YTlhZGIxMzQyOGNiYTY1ZTJiYTRhMTIxMzQ5">“What’s a variable training sword?”</p>
<p class="cnM0OGJiNjRjY2EyOTQ2MjY5YTIwYjViOGI5ZGY4NDQ0">“It’s just like the one you used with Grandmaster Gu, only the handle is hollow and removable,” with his hands Aiden made the shape of a small circular disc, “You can clip in weights about this size into the handle and reattach it.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MTMyMTY2YzgyYjRmOWE4OWJjNWVhMzYyZWVhMTIy">“Which is exactly what we did,” Serena continued, “Every week or so, when he wasn’t looking we’d open his sword up and make it <em>ever so slightly</em> heavier.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGEyMDc0NzA1MDQwMWFhYzlmMGI5YWMzNmQ4ZGFj">“Did he notice?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjc2N2Q2ZWE5ODQ2ZmNhMzNhZTIzMTJhMTEwYjdm">“No! We were certain he would! Jorge was always too afraid to move up a weight by picking a heavier training sword, so we did it for him. Every week for two months! And then…”</p>
<p class="cnMwOWZlMjMwNTc3YTRjYzM5NDUyNDU0ZDhlYjcxMTZl">“...Then it was the end-of-semester tournament,” Aiden said with a grin. “Guess what we did right before it was his turn?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YjJmOTJmMWU2ODQwOGY5YTg3YTE1Nzg0MmE4YThi">“What?”</p>
<p class="cnMxNGRjMTg4N2ZiMzRjMjdiMmM4ZjFhZDUzOTZkMDNk">“Distracted him and removed all the weights!” Aiden burst out laughing before catching himself, “I can still remember his face as he unsheathed his sword on the arena floor!”</p>
<p class="cnM5ODk1OTAyZjZhODQ5ZTJhNGZjZWQ5NDQxYjQ4MTVh">“Ha! I remember the referee asking him if everything was alright! Pfft!” Serena giggled, and Amelia once again enjoyed the sensation of Serena’s chest moving as she laughed. “And when he swung it against his first opponent, his strike smashed right through the defence and knocked him out!”</p>
<p class="cnM4N2NjNDFkNWM2NDRlN2RhZTE1MmVlNWMxODc1M2Iy">Aiden laughed mid-drink and choked on his fortified alcohol. “Remember how he looked at his sword afterwards? Like he couldn’t understand what just happened? Good times!”</p>
<p class="cnM5MGEzNzI3MTYwYTQxZDA5M2VmNGQ2YjgxM2MyZmQ2">“Ah… I wonder what he’s doing now…” Serena mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnMyZTM2OGQ0ODAyMTRjMTBiZTk2NWU1OGY1MWQzZGU2">“Last I heard, he was working as a convoy guard for some Sabanis company running spices.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWI5ZWFkZmE5YjQzZGI5MGQ2OGEyYjQ5NDg1ODZk">“Hmm. Good money,” Serena said.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjM1MjRjMjRjZDRiYmFiYzJmNWNhOGExMDQ3OGM0">The conversation naturally lulled, and the trio finished the bottle of fortified wine without any more spillage. By the time they got up to leave, Amelia was well and truly wobbling on her feet. Serena wasn’t far behind, although she still managed to walk with her usual dignity. Aiden seemed to be handling the alcohol the best, although his words were starting to slur ever so slightly.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTUyMmZlZDVhOTRlYzE5NDExY2VlN2YzN2JlZDhk">“Right!” He declared, “It’s time for the final stop.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMWJmZDYwYjM4YTRjNzdhYjZkODc3MDdiYWEwNjYw">“Another pub?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTU4ZTE5NGZiMDRlN2E4N2E0YjYxZjJhOTRmZTg4">“No, no…” Aiden gestured down the street. “Food! I paid for meals and rooms at one of the pagoda eateries overlooking the square. They should be expecting us around about now…”</p>
<p class="cnM0YzFlNDZmNGI2YzRmNzI5NzRkM2QyNTBjZWQyYmU0">They exited the street, and Aiden guided them back into the main procession which was now stuffed with thousands of demons and humans. As they pushed their way through the crowd Amelia was just starting to feel like she was going to become lost when Serena grabbed hold of her hand with a firm and warm grip.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDIwOTdhMDdmOTRhZjBhZjQwNjIwZjIwM2JhZGIx">“So you don’t get lost,” she said with a smile.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDFlMDA1ZmIwNDQ0NTg5YWU2MWM5ODRhNTQ1MGUz">“Sure, I- hic!” Amelia covered her mouth as a bout of hiccups took over her. Fighting to contain them by sheer willpower alone, they arrived at the entrance of a pagoda. The religious building was covered in bunting and colourful statues of kami burning incense out of their mouths.</p>
<p class="cnNiMzk4MTgzNmRhYTQwNzhiNDlhZWE2NDRmMDBiMmQz">“It’s technically not a shrine,” Serena whispered as they walked in. “Business isn’t allowed to be conducted on the premises of religious buildings, so this is more of a… temple-themed restaurant.”</p>
<p class="cnM1OWU2OWFlYjIyNzRhNzY5MTZmOTE3NDI1NGJlMTk0">Aiden led them up a central flight of stairs until they reached one of the upper floors. The space was split up into half a dozen sections, each with their own tables and couches. The sliding walls had been opened to reveal a sparkling and festive Kenhoro spread out as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p class="cnM5N2JmOTcwNGFlNjQ5ZjZiMDZlODYyNjE3YzZiNTJl">Once they found their reserved section, Amelia all but collapsed on the couch. She announced she was going to close her eyes for a bit and to wake her up when the food was here.</p>
<p class="cnM1YmIxZDg3ZGNmMzQxYTA4MGFlZjhhODQwYjM2ZGE2">“Make sure to get some chicken,” she mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzBmZTljNjUxZTQxZWU4ZTIwZjkwMjY3NTMzNThl">“Chicken?” She heard Aiden ask.</p>
<p class="cnM3NWZlNmQ2YzFlNzQ1MTBhN2JjNWViZGU5YjllZDk4">“She means choco,” Serena explained.</p>
<p class="cnNhNDE5MzkwYzZhMjQ3YzM5ZmM5ZTcxZjNkNzZhZDgw">“And some loqua!” She blurted out, suddenly remembering the delicious drink from the inn. Aiden had been generous enough to organise this entire night so she thought it would be fair to treat the group to a bottle of the stuff.</p>
<p class="cnNjMThmNWU5ZGZkNDQ5N2E5ZTZjNjljZTg0YjFiNGY0">Or a few bottles, depending on how it went.</p>
<p class="cnNhNWJlYTgwM2ZiYjRjMjk4MjA4YzMwNjgxM2U1YTFk">After assuring the others she would pay for it, Amelia heard Aiden walk off to find someone to order from. A few moments passed, and she felt a soft pair of lips press against her cheek.</p>
<p class="cnMwZGM2MGViZjVjNjQ0YTQ5MmFjMmVlYmI5ZGU1YzI0">“I’m heading down for a few minutes. There are some things I want to add to the order,” Serena whispered, “You feeling okay?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZDg3N2U3M2NiYjRlYzU4NTViOTZlNjJjNjUyZDY5">“Yeah, just sleepy. I’ll stay here.” Amelia mumbled, burying her face into a cushion. The alcohol had hit her harder than she expected and all she wanted to do was have a nap. She could easily wipe all traces of alcohol from her body with a spell but she was rather enjoying the feeling of being drunk and wanted to avoid using magic for now.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODE2Y2EwNzg0MTQyMzY4NmMxYzg5ODQxMGZlOGNk">She heard Serena’s footsteps fade and soon she could only hear the light chattering of other groups on the same floor backed by the deep drumming of the festival. She was just about to drift off into a satisfying sleep when a nasal voice pierced her foggy mind.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDBhMmEyNDQ0ZTQ2YzA5ZDU3ZmNhOGQzMGNkYWEx">“I <em>cannot</em> accept that this establishment does not have a room for someone of <em>my stature</em>! They should be bending over backwards to give me the entire floor!”</p>
<p class="cnMxZmFjZjI4ZWI3MDQ2YTFhYzk1ODc3MzA1NzYwYTBh">Amelia heard the arrogant and selfish tone in the boyish voice and felt herself frown. Well, she was sure this person and the group he was with would soon move onto another floor. Surely she wouldn’t be so unlucky as to deal with this drama alone, right?</p>
<p class="cnNhMzJjNzBlNTg3ZTQ0YzFiNWNjOGY0OGM0NmIxZjM3">“Look here, Lord-Prospect! There’s an empty room here!”</p>
<p class="cnM0MWViNDk2ZWU0YzQxZjdiM2FkZTg4ZjEyMWZmNjk1">“Ah, finally! It has a good view too! Now, go and get some drinks, will you?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YzlmYTg2NjRmMDQzMTM5NjY0MzllNzA2ZDMwZGU3">“Y-yes, Lord-Prospect!”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmJlZDQyM2RkZTQ0NDBiYjU5NTJiMTU2NDE1NjBj">Amelia’s frown deepened when she heard the group's footsteps come closer and she had to refrain from sighing when she heard the door to her area slide open. With her eyes closed her senses counted six men stumbling into the room.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTBhM2UzNTQ1MTRmYmFiYjk0YmVjZDMyODJhZGY1">“There’s someone in here!” One of the men cried out in surprise, his words slightly slurred.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjM0NjVmZjA5NzQxODdhZTRhZjllNjk4NmEwMTI2">Amelia groaned and turned around, burrowing her head into the side of the sofa. She would just wait until Serena came back, then she could watch her girlfriend kick ass and protect her.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTllZDMxNGE3YjRlMzVhNGYxOWZhODQ2ZWNmNDNi">Not that she <em>needed </em>protection, of course.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTYxZmM0ZDlmMDQyN2Q5NWFhNjJiYTZlM2RiZTFl">“Wha- what’s <em>this!?</em>” The nasal voice piped up again, “What is a <em>human</em> doing <em>here!?</em>”</p>
<p class="cnM5NGI2YTAwZjY0OTQ0YTViYTFiNGUwNDI0MDk2MTc5">“Maybe she’s a kitchen wench, Lord-Prospect?”</p>
<p class="cnMwYjExMGRlZDVlNjRkODQ4NWI0OGZhZjM1MGI5YmQx">“Don’t be a fool, her clothes are too fine for that.”</p>
<p class="cnMwOWRiNjBjMmM5MTQ0NTViNjRlNzhlNzU5OGViOTFk">“A working girl, then?”</p>
<p class="cnM5MDU4ZDRkNjUyNTQ4OTk4NTFmNzE5NWUxMTdhMjFj">“She can be our evening entertainment! Come here, you!”</p>
<p class="cnM2Yzg1YmFlODcxNTRiYmVhMTg2MTQ2NDJiMDU0OWUz">Amelia scrunched up her face as she felt her anger flare. She could sense the approaching hand, threatening to grab her shoulders and turn her around.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjZkMjNiZmFlNTQ3Y2RhYmU2ZWI5OTJmNTBhYjVi">“Piss off,” she said and the hand paused. Amelia rolled her eyes and with an awful lot of effort re-orientated herself so she was facing the room. She lifted and rested her jaw on one hand and opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzkwYmQxMmMxOTQ2OTQ4NzVjYmJhYmMxNjk5OWJi">Six shocked demons stared at her. At first glance, she thought they looked like clones of each other. Each wore traditional robes with the same black hair braided into a ponytail. Their cheeks were flushed red with drunkenness and their eyes wide with surprise. On closer inspection she found they varied by their horns. Some had only one pair, while others had two and the one in the most expensive-looking clothing sported three pairs of black horns sprouting from his head.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzZhODY3ZGQwMDQ4ZDE5Yjk5ZTQyODM2Nzg0ZDAy">Of course, they didn’t come close to the magnificence of Serena’s horns.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzdmMjgxOWYwNDQ3NDI4NDE2MmJhYWQ2NmU4NWQ4">“Y-you!” One of the men pointed at her, “What did you say to Lord Jin!?”</p>
<p class="cnMwOThiYmQzNTgzNjQyNzZhZWI1OGNlYjdhNmY2MDkx">“What are you doing?” Amelia glared at the group. “My friends and I paid for this room. It’s not yours, so <em>piss off!</em>” Her repeated expletives seemed to send another wave of shock throughout the rabble.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODQ5NGExNTBhNDQ3YjA5Y2M3ZDNjZmMxNWU1NGZk">“Human girl,” said the demon with three pairs of horns. “Before I decide upon your punishment, what is your name?”</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2FlNzRmODZjNDRhMWFiYzE1YTM2MDQ4YjI0YTQz">Amelia yawned loudly, not bothering to cover her mouth. She could almost hear Serena nagging her about the breach of etiquette in her mind. “Amelia. What’s yours? Jin, right?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMWE1NjgwMzc4ZTQwNzM4ZTA4MWViMDM2ZWVlNjlh">“It’s <em>Lord</em> Jin, human!” The drunk lord’s eyes flashed with anger, “Who do you work for!?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NmIyYzQwNDVjNTQyYzk4MTVmM2MwMmEwYWZmYjg2">“Mmm… my master. I’m her maid.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZmZlZGE5ZTZhMDRkYTg5OGY4MGY2MDQ0ZmFjYTQ5">“You’re <em>a maid</em>!?” One of the men behind lord Jin exclaimed. “How dare you address our Lord with such impunity! Lord Jin, allow us to teach her a lesson! We’ll have her kissing your feet in no time!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NzViMzdjMGU4YzQ3OTg5ZGI3OTlhN2JjMTJlM2Uz">“Oh?” Amelia stifled another yawn, her intuition telling her these men were no threat to her whatsoever. “Is that the only way you can get close to a woman?” She formed the best snarky smile she could muster. “I guess you probably pay them. Although there’s not enough denarii in all of Cascadia to make me willingly come within six feet of you. Pfft!” Amelia giggled as the man went as red as a tomato. She could actually see his veins bulge as his blood pressure skyrocketed.</p>
<p class="cnNjYmRjNmMwN2I0ODQ3MDE4N2MyNTZhNmU1MDBlYmE0">Well, if he actually had a heart attack she might step in, but until then…</p>
<p class="cnNiNjU1Y2U2YzZmMzQ2NDliMDdjNWFiZGJkOTBhZGVi">“You… you have a death wish!” Lord Jin shouted, drawing a gleaming sword and pointing it at her, his drunken face contorting with rage. When did they have swords? Well, she was so drunk that she probably didn’t notice.</p>
<p class="cnNiNGUzMmEyMTkwODQwYmNiMGI0MmIzYTI1N2UzYzE5">“That’s an awfully weak grip for such an impressive-looking sword,” Amelia continued. She knew she ought to stop, but the words kept flowing. “I suppose you’re compensating for something? What a tragic experience it must be for a woman to be bed by you!”</p>
<p class="cnNiMDEwYWFiZTExYjRjOTRhM2E2NzEyYWFlMmQ3YjBi">Lord Jin spat on the floor. “You’re pretty for a human; let’s see how smug you look once I’ve carved your face,” he pressed the sword’s tip into her cheek with enough force that would cut someone who hadn’t warded themselves. “You all saw it, right?” Lord Jin said to the room as a cruel smile formed on his face. “She attacked me in a drunken rage, right!? What a crazy woman…”</p>
<p class="cnNkZWYyNmQ5N2FiZDQxMTFhNDE5NDIxNTljMTQ1ZTdi">Just as her assailant's eyes took on a deadly glint that Amelia felt no threat from, the sliding door to the room opened and a familiar set of footsteps could be heard.</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2MzOWJjNDFlYjQ0NDliNTk5ODdmZGU2M2RkODc5">“Hello!” Amelia said cheerfully as Serena appeared in view. “I see you got the loqua!” Her girlfriend was carrying a bottle of blue loqua and just seeing the liquid made Amelia lick her lips in anticipation, although the action was somewhat inhibited by the sword pressing into her cheek.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTQyYWE0MjEzNzQxYjliYzNiNjAxZjNjNDVjOTAw">“Aiden’s bringing the food up now,” Serena said with a yawn. She sat down on a chair at the side of the room and rested her chin on her hand. “You going to do anything about that?” Serena asked, gesturing to the rabble that was souring the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="cnNjYjJhMTU3ZGJhZjQ0YmY5YjFlYzhhMzM4YzZkNjE0">“I’m <em>awfully</em> tired,” Amelia said, punctuating her statement with a yawn. “I was stalling for time until you got back. I thought it was only fair, you know?”</p>
<p class="cnNjYmU5NGE4NDk0MTRiYjA4MDYwNjZlYmU4NjIyYTQ2">“Fair?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNjI2ZGI4OTgwODQ0OGZhNmRjNzcwOTAyMTY4NGM0">“You got to watch me dancing earlier. I was hoping you’d put on a show for me!” She grinned at Serena, who sighed before slowly standing up.</p>
<p class="cnM4NjYyYzZhOTI0NjQxZDI5M2I3OTNiNmQ5MDc5MzQ5">“You! Are you the master of this <em>maid</em>!?” Lord Jin spat, “I demand compensation! I’m fining you both!”</p>
<p class="cnM3NTc2YTRlOGVkZTQxZGVhNjAwNzQzMzA4NTQ2NDg3">“Can he do that?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnMxOGMzM2UzMDAxNTQ2MDVhN2I1YmU4ZmFkYjg4MWU4">“No, only Speakers can fine the public,” Serena sighed again before putting down the bottle of loqua and rolling her shoulders. “What do I get if I put on a good show?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMjVhMTZkOGNmYTQwZDZhMDdlM2ZkZWUzNGM4M2E2">“Mmm…” Amelia grinned as the idea formed in her head. “If you can get them all on the floor <em>unconscious</em> in five seconds, I’ll do whatever you request <em>back at the inn</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM2YTk0YWE1ODhjMzQ1NWViN2M5MjdkM2FlNWFmMDFh">Her voice had barely faded before Serena started moving, and as the violence erupted against the helpless group, Amelia couldn’t help but feel impressed.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzgwYmFhYjdkYTQyMTJiNmU0ZTRkZGI1ZWE4MjIw">After all, she had never seen Serena move so fast with so much determination!</p>

      <description>Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Merchant Girl From Tanhae</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNhYTM2NjljNzBmOTQ3NTM5ZmE3ODQyOTQ4MjgwOTBm"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNlNDg5YmZlNjA1NDQwM2U4YTNiYWUyYjAyNDdiZjg1">“And <em>how </em>did all this happen?” Aiden asked as he stepped into the room carrying a tray of food. The restaurant workers he was assisting let out little gasps of shock as they took in the scene of devastation and lust-driven violence.</p>
<p class="cnMzYTg0NmU5NDhjYzQ5NjNiZTdiZWZkMjk1ZjFjYjhi">“<em>She</em> happened,” Amelia said with a grin, gesturing to Serena standing proudly over a pile of unconscious demons. “The one with three pairs of horns put his blade against my throat so <em>Speaker</em> Halen protected me,” Amelia emphasised Serena’s title as a Speaker, which had the intended effect; the restaurant employees suddenly became very docile, and their eyes took on a mixture of fear and respect as they fixed their gaze upon Serena.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODczN2U3N2I1YjQwNmJiZGU5ZmJjMWFlY2RiODBj">She figured that considering Serena’s status as a lord-prospect, war hero, and Speaker, the establishment might be willing to avoid the hassle of kicking them out. Her prediction turned out to be correct as the owner soon appeared and after a quiet conversation with Serena and Aiden the unconscious rabble was taken away.</p>
<p class="cnM0YWQ5OWJiMjEwNzQwZGJiNzExMWFkMTgxNmQxNDJh">They even gave them another bottle of blue loqua on the house!</p>
<p class="cnMxNzYxOWI0NzczNjQ1YWZiYzEwNTk3ZTBhZTUxZDBh">“When I become a citizen, will I be able to go around giving such <em>firm</em> etiquette lessons myself?” Amelia asked Serena after the employees had left.</p>
<p class="cnMyY2Y3YzA2ZDU3ODRmYzI4NjA4MWNmYjgxNjM5ODY3">“Stop calling them etiquette lessons, idiot,” Serena said while rolling her eyes. “You were <em>assaulted</em>. This was self-defence. Here,” She sat down and poured the three of them a glass of blue loqua. Now awake, Amelia licked her lips in anticipation.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjdlYTQzZDcxMjRjZWM4ZTU4N2I0MDcxZWUzZDk2">“A toast,” Serena said, raising her glass. Amelia and Aiden copied.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTA3YThmYWM3YTQ1MjVhNjc2NjNmOGVhNzVjYjlh">“To what?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzY0NGI4OGVjZjQxMzRiOWUxZmJmOGRkMjczMGU4">“To…” Serena hesitated momentarily, “To the end of the war!”</p>
<p class="cnNlODZhZDE5NjcxMjQzNjliN2RkY2U0MDQ5YmVhNzFl">“To the end of the war!” Amelia and Aiden echoed. They clinked their glasses and took a sip. Although the taste was every bit as delicious as she remembered, Amelia couldn’t help but catch the sombre look in Serena’s eyes. Her girlfriend had been at war for a long time and it had slowly taken its toll.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTQ4NWNkMjQ5NzRkYzk5OTlhYjA3MTVkMmZkNDcy">As long as the conflict went on, Amelia silently vowed to be Serena's unyielding support. She would shower her girlfriend with as much love and affection as she could during and after the war ended.</p>
<p class="cnNiNTIyYjZiZmMxNzQ3YjE5MjIwMTI2MTY0MDIyMDM0">“Oh, sweet hells,” Aiden mumbled. “My sweet, delicious, <em>blue</em> friend! How I’ve missed your taste! Oh, and what’s this!” The demon’s eyes widened as he saw the extra bottle of blue and green Serena had bought. “You’ve brought your family along! Praise the fell gods!” While it looked like he was about to weep from happiness, Amelia asked Serena something that had been bothering her.</p>
<p class="cnM1NmE2NWY1ZGUwYjRhZGI5ODEyMTc4YzgxYzQxYTgz">“I heard Lord Jin refer to himself as a lord-prospect, but everyone called him <em>lord</em>. Are both titles correct?”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDVhMjcwMWYxZTQ4ZTRiY2I3ZGEyMDk0MzFjOWE1">“It depends. <em>Lord-prospect</em> is the correct title, but his lackeys were likely trying to appease him for their own benefit.” Serena shrugged, sipping her glass. “Employees of the house will refer to me as <em>lady</em>, a Cascadian Lord would refer to me as <em>lord-prospect</em>, while to anyone else, I would be <em>Speaker</em> or <em>Captain</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNmI2YWEwNTc1NzRjZGJhNjQxM2I5MzJkNGZjNTZi">“So many titles! Will I become a lord?” Amelia asked. Instead of replying Serena gestured towards Aiden, who appeared to have recovered from his ecstasy enough to join in the conversation.</p>
<p class="cnM1OGViM2I4MTg3NjQ0MGY5MGM5MjQwY2E3ZDkwNDRl">“With Lord Yulan and Grandmaster Gu’s recommendations, they’ll make you a citizen and a lord, I’m sure…” Aiden said, trying not to slur his words.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTI5MDI3ZTI0MDRkOTE5ZjIyYmViNDA3OThlYTQ1">“So fast?” Serena asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p class="cnNmNmI3NjQ3N2M1ODRkMGRhNDNiODZkYmFmNGE5YjQz">“They’ll want to lock her down. Remember, she’s a friendly Speaker of a <em>healing</em> branch.” Aiden leaned back, swirling the loqua in his glass, “Demonkind has no gods of healing. Sure, aura helps recovery, and some of the support wards from the mages can do their part, but nothing like the human <em>Aseco</em> branch.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZTJhODYyOGNjMDQwN2Y5YjNlOTcyM2I2YzA5NDRi">“Still… a human lord…” Serena murmured.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjVhZTIwNjYxNDQyYThhOWNhNTc1OGI1NzkzOGQ5">“There are <em>some</em> human lords in the Centralis,” Aiden said with a thoughtful expression, “And the North. It’s only the eastern and southern overlords who prohibit it.”</p>
<p class="cnM1Nzc5ZDUzYzNiZTQ4MDA5YmU2MDliMjAxZWRmMjdi">“What about the West?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmVmYzkwMWEwZjRjZmY5NDYxZThlMDJmYzUwZTQz">“Eh…” Aiden wobbled his hand in the air, “The West has their own way of doing things.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MGYzNzQxYzhhZDRmNjI5YTBmODg5ODRkNDQ4OTkw">“What’s their overlord like?” Amelia had long noticed the West was the least talked about Empire territory.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDhkYzFlOTkyZTQ3M2Y5YjM1YTE0MWU0YjNjNWY4">“Who knows?” Aiden shrugged, “No one has ever seen him. Or her, for that matter. Well, I suppose the Empress knows who they are. Even their name is unknown. But get this,” Aiden leaned in with a mysterious glint in his eye, “The one singular fact that is public knowledge about the western overlord is that they are the strongest of the four. Quite the mystery, right?”</p>
<p class="cnNkZTBjMzFlMDQ0YjRiZWNiZDg3ZDk3YTcxYjljZmE3">It <em>was </em>quite the mystery! Amelia suddenly felt an urge to explore the West. “Can we go there?” She asked Serena, who shook her head.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTg5OTk5MDA1MjQ4NzdhMWRjNWNkMzJmZGE4MGM5">“The borders have been closed for centuries,” she explained, “You need a good reason and a visa to go there, whether by air or ground. It’s not like the rest of the Empire. Things work differently there.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMjBkM2MyMWU2NTRlNTY4NmI4NDUzNDQ5YWU3ZDQ1">“Look!” Aiden interjected as he pointed out the window, “The main procession is here!” Amelia followed his finger and saw the main square filling up with the festival goers. A large stage had been erected upon which important-looking people were taking seats.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTk3MjhkODU1ZDQ0NTY4ODQzYTJkNTBjZjBmNGFh">“Those are the Highlords,” Serena explained as she peered below. “Looks like Highlord Ru is absent, but that’s expected. Guess what Lord Yulan said is true; the seat for the greatlord is empty.”</p>
<p class="cnNmOGU0ZTVjMGNhODQwMzk4Y2I3YWY4Y2Q1OTNlMmRm">“What did Lord Yulan say?” Asked Aiden.</p>
<p class="cnM4N2UzNTg1OTU4MDRhZWRhM2NlODA0MTNkNWJhMjg4">“That something important was being transferred to Centralis and the greatlord was personally guarding it,” Serena eyed Aiden with a suspicious eye, “You wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDZkNDZiNjFkMDRlYTE4Yjk1NThmNWRmYjJjOTFh">Aiden threw one hand up. “I’m not so high up on the ladder I get told what the <em>greatlords</em> get up to. It’s news to me.” Serena held his gaze for a moment before turning back to the square.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2JhZTQ2NmY1NTRkYTQ5YTBkOGUxNzMzMTlmZThm">“The dancing will start soon,” Serena said, a hint of eagerness creeping into her voice, “We should change into our dresses, Amelia?”</p>
<p class="cnMwOWM3MDFjYzUxOTQ0NmZhMzY3NzRiN2ViNzY1NmFh">“S-sure!” Amelia sprang up and fetched Aiden's bag with their dresses. Serena adjusted a paper screen to block the view from Aiden or anyone else coming in and the pair of them set about undressing and dressing each other. They fumbled about, the alcohol taking its toll on their dexterity. Serena didn’t need any help with her black dress, but Amelia needed the extra pair of hands to assist her.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWU0ZjU3Y2EzYzQxZTFiMTExNDRmMmYzMGM4NWZl">An extra pair of hands that didn’t miss the opportunity to grope her breasts.</p>
<p class="cnNiNmMwMTA3ZTEyMzQ5MjZiOTU4NGU2NjY1NzhmNjM2">“I can hear you giggling!” Aiden called out. “Don’t think I can’t guess what you’re getting up to!” Having been caught, the pair of them finished up and exited.</p>
<p class="cnNhNWE4YTIxZDJmYzRjYzJhMzlhNjUyMzEzNDYyNWJk">“Seven hells,” Aiden exclaimed as they appeared. “Don’t you look like quite the pair! This is the first time I’ve seen you in a dress since graduation,” Aiden said, tilting his head towards Serena, “And of course, you look lovely in red, Speaker Thornheart.”</p>
<p class="cnNjM2Y1YTVhOGM4YzQ5OTNiNTViOWYzZTY4Y2JlOWMx">Amelia giggled at the compliment. “I wish we had dress shoes!” Both she and Serena were still wearing the practical work shoes they used on their day-to-day adventures.</p>
<p class="cnMyOWRkNWFiOTNjNDQwZDlhZWFiYzM3YzllMzFjODlh">“I’d rather have our feet in something we can move in if a fight breaks out,” Serena explained pointedly, tapping her shoes against the wooden floor.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTk5M2YyZTY0MzRiODA4OTg4ZDk2MDA3ZGIxNTBl">“Who’s going to start a fight down there in front of all those Highlords?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnMyZGNmYzIzNzQ3NDQxMjliMGU2NzVlYjFjZTMwN2M2">“Who’s going to start a fight in a <em>cafe</em>?” Serena answered with a blank expression. “Who’s going to <em>Speak</em> in public? Who’s going to start a fight in here?” Serena reached out and slightly ruffled Amelia’s hair, “You’re a magnet for trouble, you know?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjBkNDI5OGE4MjQ0YWZiMWNhMjg5ZGE0ODE0Yjdh">“Hey! Don’t mess up my hair!” Amelia protested and began adjusting her braids. Serena rolled her eyes and dug out two rainhats for them.</p>
<p class="cnNhZmFlYzkyMGI0NzRlZjJhZjU4ODU2YWEyYTk3NmRk">“It’s drizzling, so wear this.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMmU5MDVmYjA1MjQ1YjU5ZmZkNzQ0N2VmMDI4NjA0">Donning their hats and receiving the very strongest promise that Aiden wouldn’t drink all the loqua while they were gone, they proceeded downstairs and out into the main square. The space was packed with people who were dancing to the festival drums. Serena pulled her into the throng, and the pair of them began giggling as they tried to copy everyone else's energetic movements.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDUyZmJhOTg2YTQyOGNhMjI1ZjllZDM5NTQ5M2Nm">Turned out, with enough alcohol in her, Serena was every bit as much of an enthusiastic dancer as she was.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjIyZmIxNzUwYTRjM2ViODczODEwMGIzOTg0ODdi">Luckily, the tailor did an exceptional job, and the dresses were tailored to allow vigorous dancing. As the night stretched on and the tempo of the drums increased, Amelia felt herself fall into a trance-like state, much like she did while training. She wasn’t sure, but for a few moments she felt like the connection she had with her girlfriend actually manifested into something tangible. Something in the aetherfield that she could sense.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjk5Yjc2YjhiZjRkMjBhZjg3NTBkN2VmNDRhNTdi">Or maybe she was just terribly drunk.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDE2MTAwZGM1MjRjYjVhOTY5ZDBmYTVkNGVlNDdj">“So, I did it, didn’t I?” Serena asked when the tempo slowed down and they could simply hold each other in an embrace while swaying from side to side.</p>
<p class="cnM4Zjg3Mjc2NjRlYTRmMDliYWVlYWYyM2Y3Y2UwYzYw">“Did what?” Amelia asked, enjoying the close contact. Their hats had protected them from much of the rain, but enough had gotten through to cause parts of their dresses to stick to their skin, leaving little to the imagination.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjQ3MDdhZTI0ZTRlYTk4OTgxZmZhYjA2YTczODFm">“I knocked them all out within five seconds.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNTY3ZDk1NmIxMTRhZDRiY2U4OGI2OTA1NzhjNzM0">“Oh... Oh!” Amelia grinned as she saw Serena begin to blush. She tried to meet Serena’s gaze but everytime their eyes would meet Serena would look away with a nervous smile.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTdjNGQ3NDE3ZjQyNzNiM2Y2MmQ0YTMxYTliZmY2">“Stop grinning like an idiot, idiot.”</p>
<p class="cnNlZDlkYmJiNzcxODRlY2U5M2MyZmYwZDNlZDZlMjdm">“I can’t help it!” Amelia felt her grin grow even wider. She removed her rainhat so she could nuzzle against Serena’s neck. “So what did you want me to do?” She whispered. “You’re so warm…” Amelia mumbled to herself.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmQzNDgzYmQwYTQ2MmQ5YjIxOWI5YTg4Mzk0NjBm">“I…” Serena began before becoming quiet. As the silence stretched on, Amelia could imagine the inner battle that was taking place within her girlfriend's mind. She would never tire of how adorable Serena became at times like this. It was the <em>real</em> Serena, unlike the stern captain act she put on for the crew.</p><span class="cjRiYTUxODA2YzM5MDRkMTY5ZjY2ZDMwNjVmYjMxOWFl"><br/>Help support creative writers by finding and reading their stories on the original site.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4YmEzMWQ5NjBmMTQ1ZjFiNzBjODM1Mjk1N2U5NmUw">“Can I take a guess?” Amelia whispered. “If I’m right, you only need to say yes, and I’ll do it tonight.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOTY5NWUzNzU2MzRhNmM4OTFiMGFiOTczMGE2ZTEw">“... Fine,” came the quiet reply.</p>
<p class="cnM4MzE4YjMxMDJhZTRmMzBiZmQwMWNiOGEyOWM1ZTJj">“Well,” Amelia began, giving Serena a soft kiss on the neck. “What you did the other night with your tongue… you know, <em>between my legs?</em>” She felt Serena freeze a little at her words.</p>
<p class="cnM3NmNlYzU4MDg4MzQ3NTA4YjUzOTBkYWM3ZGU3MjAw">Bullseye!</p>
<p class="cnM2NzE1YTBkYWEyMTQxY2JhOGRhNzMxZTA5MjM1Mzgw">“I think it would only be fair if I could return the favour…” She whispered, giving Serena another kiss. “I don’t have any horns for you to hold, but I’d like it if you ran your hands through my hair. Would you like that?” For a moment, Serena didn’t reply. Eventually, she seemed to gather her courage.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDllMDkzOTJmMDRmM2Q4NGE4MjNmYjY0YjAxN2U3">“Yes…” Serena whispered, “I’d like that.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMzA1ZmY1ZTc4NzRhODdiNzhjMjQ1N2RmMWVlYTNl">“Wonderful!” Amelia pulled back and lifted Serena’s rainhat to give her a kiss on the lips before her girlfriend could protest. “You know what they say! You get what you ask for!”</p>
<p class="cnM1YTkyM2MwOWJmOTRmMjA4MDRjZjhjNmU3YmExZjIx">“Shut up…” came the small reply. Still, Serena pulled her into an embrace and Amelia took the opportunity.</p>
<p class="cnNjNmIxOGYyNjU1MjRlMmFhOTM0NTQwZjcxYjU3NDY5">“You’re not going to <em>believe</em> how fast I can move my tongue,” she whispered.</p>
<p class="cnM1NTc0MDUzZjJjYzRmNjM5NGEzMjYwOTc4NWQ2NjQx">“Damn you… let’s go,” Serena said quietly, pulling Amelia by the hand.</p>
<p class="cnM1YjllZTAzNjQ4MzRjYzZiY2MwMWVlYzc2NWJmZTA1">“Where?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDE4OTVjNTQ2ZjQ0MGI5MzQ3ZTA5Mjk5MTZlZjdk">“To get whatever loqua Aiden hasn’t drunk and then…” Serena paused, not turning back as she guided Amelia through the crowd. “... and then we go back to the inn.”</p>
<p class="cnNjOGEzZDBmMGM3ZjRlMDc4NmFhNjIxYjQzNjEzMDg1">Amelia felt her face blossom with happiness as an atmosphere of anticipation fell upon them.</p>
<p class="cnM4MmY0NDVhMTg2MzQ0ODE5ZGNjZTRmMGQ2YWZhMWE5">It would be another night with little sleep.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWI1NTZlNWU2MzQwYzRhMTM4Mzc2MWNkNGM5ODkz"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MGIxZmRmYWQ4MTRhM2FhNDhiYzY4NzNiZjgxYTNm"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWU3NzIwNWVjYTQ4MDlhZjZkYjY0ODFjZjI4ZjIy">The following day, Amelia yawned as she exited the inn. She rolled her sore tongue around her mouth. Who knew tongues could get muscle soreness? Not only that but her jaw ached some, too. Serena wasn’t with her. Her girlfriend was still passed out from the activities of the previous night. Amelia giggled at the memory and set about finding a cafe where she could get some morning coffee.</p>
<p class="cnMwOWJiODYwNzQ4NjQ2NTViYTNkZjE1OWMzMTk3ZGMy">Serena’s favourite coffee was made from beans from Jimar, a plateau city somewhere in the Southern Terra Firma. The delivery for the inn still hadn’t come in yet, so Amelia thought she would go hunting before Serena woke up.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTgzZjFmYzk2MDRkNWM5ODgzOWQwODBmMDdmZTU0">Navigating through the streets, Amelia found luck in her third cafe. Take-out cups didn’t seem to be common in Cascadia so she was forced to purchase a large flask as well. After paying she exited the cafe to see a city guard arguing with a human woman dressed in simple work clothes.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2QyZjNkMTUzOTQwYTFhOGE0ZDdiNjA1ZWU1Nzdh">“Look! I’m <em>just trying-</em>” The woman protested against the city guard who had grabbed her by the arm. She had an unusual accent that Amelia had never heard before.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTJiMWEwZDgxYjQ0ZDU4MTgzZjdhZTRmOTFlMDg2">“I saw you skulking about!” The guard barked, “What’re you doing around here? Do you have a work permit?”</p>
<p class="cnNmZTVjMzhiYTZiMjQ0YTM4MmFhY2E1MzFiODkwMTBl">“I docked just the other day! I’m part of the convoy from Tanhae!”</p>
<p class="cnNhYzFkOTgxMWVmNjQ3ZTdiY2NhOGRhYjZiMzRhODQ5">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZWRiMTUyNWYwOTRjZWU4MGIxNmViNTJhMzNlODIz">“Yes! Yes, it is! Look I have my documents here!” The woman pulled out some papers and shoved them into the guard's face. “See! I have a visa!” The guard let go of the woman’s arm while glaring at her. After a moment he began sifting through the papers one by one, glancing up at the annoyed-looking woman every few seconds.</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2Q3OGM3ZTU3YzRlZjNhZTEwNDlhM2VmOThjZTRk">“The Mehta Group?” The guard asked, “That who you work for?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZTY3NjYzNzhiODQyNWRhOWVkODY5MDE2MmNiMzUy">“Yes! I help run the books!”</p>
<p class="cnMxMWFmYWFhMTA0OTQ2Y2I4MzUxZTA1ZDIwZjEzMzk5">“And you are…” The guard flipped through the papers, “Tatiana Lebedev? What’s a Federation girl like you doing working this far south?”</p>
<p class="cnM4MTZjM2M4YzkzZTQ2NjZiMzc2NDk0MTI2ZDlhYmJk">“I go where there’s money to hire me,” Tatiana said bluntly.</p>
<p class="cnM4NGEzMDAzZTk3MzQ4NGE4YjZiZDYzNGZiZTMwZTAz">“Is that so…” The guard looked like he wanted to interrogate the poor woman further, but then he noticed Amelia spectating awkwardly to the side. He frowned at her momentarily before his eyes widened slightly in recognition. “Hrmph!” he said, handing back the papers to Tatiana. “Stay out of trouble. Don’t wander out of the human districts, or you’ll cause problems.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NGRkMjBjOWE5ZDQwN2E4ZDM2Yzc2NzkyZDY4MzA4">“... Yes. I’m sorry,” Tatiana said with a defeated expression. The guard glanced between them before clicking his tongue and walking away. Tatiana walked over to a nearby table and collapsed with a weak groan.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjU5NTA3ZTJjZDRkYmU5MDA0YmI3YmE2YWFlOGRj">“They don’t seem bothered by you,” Tatiana said with her face in her hands.</p>
<p class="cnNjNGQ2NDdmZTQxNTQzNDI5YzE5ZmRhOGJkNDA2ZDA0">“Me?” Amelia pointed at herself.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDE2MGJiZmY0ODQzM2Y4YmQ2MmYzMjY0ODk2NjM0">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNGIyNDM4M2RiYjQ4ZGFhOTBhNGIwYWM3NTAyMjFh">“Well, I guess they’ll get to know you eventually.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYTUxNWZlYmJmMzQ4YmFiZmY0ZGU3Nzg0YzJhOTAz">“I was only sent to buy everyone some morning coffee… The human districts don’t have the good stuff…” Tatiana mumbled, rubbing her face before slamming her hands on the table. “Alright! Just a little setback. You can do it, Tatiana!”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWY1MTViMmVkYzQzNjhiMDBmMmMzN2U1YjNkNmI5">Amelia couldn’t resist a soft chuckle at the woman’s determination. She reminded her a little of herself! “They do Jimari coffee here,” she said, shaking her newly-acquired flask. “It’s a favourite of demons if you have any in your group.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjcxZDU3NDA1NDQ3YmViM2E0YTZhYWFiYzBkZTFm">“Just humans…” Tatiana said, “You don’t seem worried about being stopped. Why is that?”</p>
<p class="cnNkYjA1MGFiOTdmYTRkM2Y5M2U3NmFkYTI5NWJjMjM2">“Well…” Amelia sat down opposite Tatiana, “I’m a maid for one of the noble houses, so if I get stopped, I can just wave this around!” She pulled out the House Halen insignia and wiggled it before Tatiana’s face.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjBhOTJmMDdkYTQ4NTBiYjllMGJkOWQ1ZDhiZDgz">“House Halen…” the woman mumbled before her eyes suddenly went wide. “Sorry! We merchants need to know the important houses. House Halen employs you, then?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNDUxZmMzOWIzMjRjMGJiNDc0NzgwNWFhN2U1MDA1">“That’s right! Well…” Amelia tilted her head to the side, looking up in thought, “I’m employed directly by Ser- I mean, Lady Halen.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMWVjNDdkZTEzMTRjNjE5N2RmYTI5ZWQ0Y2JlNmYw">“So lucky…” Tatiana said, her face filled with amazement. “I wish I could find employment at a proper house like that! No one wants to hire a<em> Federation girl</em> down here, so I’m stuck bookkeeping for Sabanis merchants!”</p>
<p class="cnNiOTcyNGJkNGI1MTQ4ZGZhYzRmNzAwN2M0YmQyYTNh">“I suppose it must be difficult…” Amelia said, unsure of what to say to ease Tatiana’s frustration. “Not all demons are bad, though! Many are really nice once they get to know you!”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzNkNzZkODQ3MTQ2Yzg5ZDNjYzE2OTY2ZGQwY2Jh">“And the rest just harass and mock us for fun, I suppose… Sorry, I’ve had a rough week. I get airsick easily. Not a great trait for a merchant, is it?”</p>
<p class="cnNkYjY5Y2VkNDc4OTQ5ZGI5NjEzZTkxMzAzNTdlYzRl">“That’s okay! Here, have some coffee!” Amelia offered Tatiana some. There would be plenty left for both her and Serena, so she didn’t mind being generous.</p>
<p class="cnNjZmExMTQzYzQyZTRlOTg5MjJlNTYzZDZhNmNhZTFm">“Thanks… Uh, I’m Tatiana, by the way,” Tatiana said as she poured some of the coffee into a small cup she had produced from her person. “What’s your name?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNzBiNDEwNWJkMzQ3ZGVhMTE1ZDRiMjM5Y2MwOGY5">“I’m Amelia! Nice to meet you! Want to be friends?” She gave her best lets-be-friends smile. It hadn’t worked on Mel at the academy, but it might work here!</p>
<p class="cnM0NjhjYzgwMThiYzRjODliYWE4M2UyMzJiNDExZTI4">“Umm... sure. We’re not docked for long… but it’s better if we humans stick together, right? Being around so many demons…” Tatiana rubbed her arms awkwardly, “Makes me uncomfortable. Having another human to walk around with would make me feel safer.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMjA0NzI0NGNmNTQ4MmZhZTMxYTZjZmQ3MTZjY2U4">“Mmm! Sure! There’s so many amazing buildings to see! Oh, and there’s all kinds of tasty food at the marketplace! We can go there if you want?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMTI3MzM3NTZlNjRkN2ZhNmUzM2IzZjFkOGVhNWRm">“Ha… You’re so kind,” Tatiana mumbled. “Where are you from, anyway? With that golden hair… are you from Christdom?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMjFlOWU0ZTMwYzQwYThhYWRhM2U2YTU4Njc0NTI4">“I’m from Karligard!” Amelia answered cheerfully.</p>
<p class="cnM1N2EwMThlZTcxZjQzMmI5YWZhNmQ3OTU4YjM3MTFm">“Hmm,” Tatiana sipped the coffee as the satisfying fragrance tickled Amelia’s senses. “You’re a long way from Karligard.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZWRiMzVlMDdmOTQwOTM5MTQ0NzVkYTdkYzg1NGU3">“Well… I go where there’s money to hire me!” Amelia was happy to see a smile appear on Tatiana’s sullen face. It felt good to cheer someone up!</p>
<p class="cnNmMWVjZjliMDg2OTQ0ZmFhZjk0OGRjOGMzYjM5MmUy">“What kind of services are you hired for?”</p>
<p class="cnMzOTdiOWQ0MDdhNTQ2OTFhZjMzM2MyNWQwZDI5ZmJi">“I’m a healer of sorts!” Amelia briefly considered keeping it a secret, but she was already aware that the knowledge of her healing was spreading in all kinds of circles, so she didn’t see much point in hiding it. “I provide healing services under Lady Halen’s direction.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYTEwODE2N2M4ZjRlYTA5NTY3YzhhNDVjNzdhM2Ix">“Amazing!” Tatiana’s eyes went wide in shock. “Are you a member of the Church!?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YWE2MzRkZTRlMjRjN2E5ZTM3ZTBiYjhkNTcyOTkx">“Uh… no. I kind of avoided them. Took a different path, I guess…” Amelia rubbed her nose awkwardly.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjBkMmFlYWU3OTRmNGI5ZTEzZDQyNjFkMzExMmIy">“It’s no problem. We all take our own journeys in life,” Tatiana said, her eyes taking on a far-away look. “Would you like to meet up later in the week and walk around the market? I need to buy stationary and ink, and I would feel better if someone local was with me. The rest of my group doesn’t want to leave the human district.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MGQzNGQyNTQ3YjRhMzc4YjMzZTZmOGY2NmE2ZDM0">“Sure! We could do it today, if you like?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDM1Njg5Zjc3NjQyMDU4NGVkZTVjYTliM2QxYzQ4">“Sorry,” Tatiana shook her head, “I have so much work to do. Can we do it in three days? On the twenty-fourth?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDBlNzdmY2U2MTRjODM5MWM2ZDMxMTYyZGY2MjI4">“Mmm! Can do!”</p>
<p class="cnMyY2VjMDgyNGU2OTQ1ZmQ5NjhkYjQ1ZWNmMmE1MDFm">“Would it be okay to meet here? At midday?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjE1OTBlYzEzNjRhN2FhN2EwZDdlODZmOTYxZTQ5">“Could we do two o’clock? I have training midday.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMzU5Zjg4MzIzNjRlZWM5YTIyN2RmNmY5N2E5NzMx">“Training?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDdhOWIxZmVhMDRhODU4MmZiMzZlMzcxODUzZjM5">“I’m learning the sword at the academy. I train there every day at lunch!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NDFjZDRkMTgyZDQ3ZGI4MmViMjFmY2ZkZDFjZjJl">“A healer learning the sword? How strange…” There was a brief flash of confusion on Tatiana's face before it settled back into a smile. “Are you a student?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDVhMTk1NjIyNDQ0MDE5NjdmNWZjMjY4MTQ1N2Mw">“No, but the Grandmaster took an interest in teaching me 'cause I’m a-” Amelia caught herself. She shouldn’t go around telling everyone she’s a Speaker. It might make her new friend treat her differently! “Because I’m a mage,” She finished.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDUyYmRkOWFlZjQwYTFiYjBlZTk1MTllMDY1MjNm">“So, two o’clock here in three days?”</p>
<p class="cnNlOGI3MTNhODNjMTQyYzhhZmJkZDgwMzkzYWM5N2Uz">“Sounds good! Do you want me to come in while you buy your coffee?” Amelia noticed Tatiana had brought a large flask with her, a level of preparation that Amelia hadn’t thought of. Tatiana nodded, so the pair of them went inside and Amelia waited while Tatiana got her flask filled.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDJhZGQ4ZTdkNzQ2NjVhZTE0ZDA2NDJhZjUzOGE2">“This is the good stuff,” Tatiana said. She had cheered up a lot now. “Jimar coffee is hard to come by outside Cascadia. No better way to start your morning.” Amelia found herself nodding. She had grown to like the bitterness and lasting aftertaste of the Jimari beans.</p>
<p class="cnM0NDFjYTYzNDAwZTQwZTFhZjg0ZTE1OWYzNDdhYTA2">“So, what kind of stuff does your merchant group… merchant?” She asked once they had exited the cafe.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzQzNTVhNDcxZDQ3MWNhZTFlNGNkOTQ1YmI1ZWY5">“The group I’m with brings down spices from Vinay, stopping at Tanhae and then here. We take back silk and cloth. Although, there are other merchant ships taking part in the convoy. It’s safer to travel as a larger group. It’s also cheaper to pay for protection.”</p>
<p class="cnNmY2Q0OTRkZGIzNjQxODc4ODg1Zjg1MjBhNTc5Njgx">“Have you visited much of the Empire?” Amelia asked. Unfortunately, her hopes of stories of adventure and pirates were dashed when Tatiana informed her she had only ran the routes from the Sabanis Dominance down to the Eastern Terra Firma and back.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2QwOWYyMTU4YzQyNTNhMWQ1NTU4NzllNzRmMzYy">“Well, thanks for everything,” Tatiana said, “It’s really nice for you to stick yourself out for me… with the war and everything, I just don’t feel comfortable around demons…”</p>
<p class="cnNjYTBkN2YwNzg0NTQ2ZWZhZDI3Y2MzNjMzNzA2MmVj">“Don’t worry! It’ll be just us! You can tell me about the Federation! I’ve never visited!”</p>
<p class="cnNmNzlmN2E0MGNhNTRkZTk4OGJlNzdkZWFjZjYyNDll">“Ha… sure!” Tatiana gave her a friendly smile, her brown hair waving in the wind. “See you in a few days, Amelia!”</p>
<p class="cnMxZDg2OTZmNGRiMDRhZDRiODhlYTg2NWZkNTJkODVm">“See you in a few days!”</p>
<p class="cnM5OGFlN2Y5MzMyZTQ4NTg4ZmYwMmEyNGFiMDAyNTA3">Amelia waved bye before skipping away, whistling cheerfully to herself. A new friend! How exciting! She would let Serena know, of course. Maybe they could eventually meet! Maybe… Serena <em>did</em> glare a lot at humans she didn’t know.</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2Q5MzBiNmY1ZTQwZmRiNDI5YmE5ZDI1MDk2Zjg1">Ah, well. It’ll work out eventually!</p>
<p class="cnM1ZGNlMzgwMGExMzRiNjNhYjIxMjA1OTI5MzRmMzcz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkOWRmZTlmODQ1ZTQxYWRhMWUwMzA2ZDU1MDY1YTI5"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Polina POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/polina.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2I1Y2ViZDk1NTQ3MGZiOWMyMmFlZTU4ZjczNDk5">Polina Volkova’s heart had only begun to settle down by the time she returned to the merchant ship. Boarding the deck, she navigated into its depths before stopping at a heavy wooden door. She gave the pre-arranged knock to indicate she wasn’t under duress and a moment passed before the sound of an iron bolt moving could be heard and the heavy door swung open.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDE2MGYxNDlkYTQwY2Q5YTJlZTI5MjhkZWNlYWUx">“Coffee?” She offered the room, holding the flask. “It’s Jimari, the good stuff.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNzA1Zjc5Y2VlNTQyMTJhZjkwNWJmZWU4MGQ5MDFi">“You’re back,” Natalia Marakova coolly intoned. “Close the door.” Polina shut the door behind her and approached the group of five; three men and two women. There were more embedded in roles in the city itself but Polina didn’t know anything about them.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTIwYTMxZWMyMDRkMDJhZThjNjM4NWQxNjVjMmEz">Things like that were on a need-to-know basis.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDhmNDFjNDg5ZTQyZWZhZTdmYzNhMjM0MDEwNmIy">“Well?” Marakova asked as Polina sat down.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDc5ZjYxZGQ3ZDQ1ZmM4YmU1MjIxOGQ2MmIyNWRj">“It went well,” Polina answered, placing the flask on the table. No one seemed to move to have some, so she busied herself by pouring some in her cup. “A guard started harassing me outside the cafe Ame- I mean, Target One visited. But that turned into an opening to start a conversation.”</p>
<p class="cnNhOTRmMmI4OGU0MTQxZmZiMDU4OTg1ZjUxYmE2NDAy">“Give us the rundown,” Marakova commanded.</p>
<p class="cnM5MzE0OWQ2ZTEzYjQyODlhNGVhNmZlNGZhMDQ5NmNm">“She’s really a maid employed by Target Two, or at the very least she believes she’s a maid. My blessing cannot distinguish between the truth and an honestly believed falsehood. Her name really is Amelia,” Polina took a sip of the coffee, finding it challenging to relax under the intense gaze of four experienced field agents.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDRmN2ZiY2I4MjRlNTM4NjRiNjZlOWFhNWVlNTdj">“She claimed to be from Karligard, but that was a lie. She said she had never visited the Federation. That was the truth. She claims not to be part of the Church. That was also the truth.”</p>
<p class="cnNiODIzYTA1ZGI5YjQ3ZDA4Mzk5NWNhNTM3ZDMyZDRj">“Where in the six heavens did she come from…” one of the field agents muttered.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzgzOWVjMWNmMzQzZWI5MzhlOTRiZmE2YmQ4YmMy">“What else?” Marakova questioned.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjk4YzM1MDU2MjQxNDM4MmY3NWQyNjRkM2E0M2Iw">“She was telling the truth about providing healing services for Target Two. She admitted to being a mage, although we knew that already.” Polina took a moment to gather her thoughts, “She’s training at the academy under the grandmaster every day at lunchtime.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzUzN2M2ZjVlNjRkMTFhNGIwMDMxNDhhZjhlNmU0">“What!? Why?” Marakova’s eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzllYWJlZWEwODRkNTRhMGE5YWM5YTczMjYzZWYx">“She’s learning the sword. I know, I found it weird too. Apparently, the grandmaster’s interested in teaching a mage.” Polina took another sip as the surrounding agents murmured for a moment amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDNhODhkYWZhMDRjMjA4ZDFkZmYwZDM1ZGM1Mzdk">“What academy is that?” Someone asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmMGEwMjFjZTZmZTQ3ODJhNmU3NDVjZTBjNjM4NDM1">“It‘ll be the Kenhoro Officer Academy. It’s the only one here with a grandmaster directing it,” Marakova explained. “Senior Polina. Recount the entire conversation from start to finish. Don’t miss anything out, no matter how trivial it seems.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNGI5Yjg2NTc5ZDQxMThhNTIwNWE4YWVjODE2N2Zh">Polina swallowed her coffee and recounted the events of that morning in as much detail as she could remember. She was surprised to find Marakova wasn’t annoyed at Polina arranging to meet Amelia in a few days and actually congratulated her on the initiative.</p>
<p class="cnM3MjM0NjNjMjUwYjRiYTU4NDc1ZjAzYmNiNzdhYzlm">“We’ll have agents tailing you for your little <em>date</em>,” Marakova said with a sly smile, “If Target Two appears, then you are to make your excuses and leave as quickly as possible. Once Target One reports that she’s made a friend with a <em>Federation accent</em> then Target Two will likely investigate.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MDU5MDQyMTkwYTRkNWM5YTU3ODRiMTBlZDkzMjRj">“Our cover should hold, right?” Polina asked. The merchant company they were sailing under was an honest company registered in Vinay. Polina wasn’t sure, but she suspected most of the employees and perhaps even the company owner himself didn’t know it was a front for Federation Intelligence.</p>
<p class="cnMwNGUzYzBiMmI3YTRlNzZiOWMyYzc4NTc5NzVmNmU3">“It’ll hold… Unless someone gets captured,” Marakova said with a grim expression. Capture meant interrogation, and interrogation likely meant torture. “Keep the pill close at all times. Hold it under your tongue during the next meeting.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMDQ0ZWE0MTNmMjQxOTJiODlmOGU5ZmY4NDAyYjUx">“Yes, team leader,” Polina couldn’t help but swallow nervously. She would have to gather intelligence while holding a pill in her mouth that would kill her if she swallowed it accidentally. It was nerve-racking yet, on a weird level, exhilarating.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjI5YTI3N2Q5YTQyM2Y4MGVlYzgxZjQxM2FhMzli">“We’ll spend the next few days going over what questions we need answered. We’ll run you through example conversations so you’ll know what to say in any circumstance. You’ll be alright, Polina Volkova.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MTVjNDE5MWM4OTQ0NmI4NjE0MzJmOTcyMjE0NDg0">“Thank you, team leader,” Polina gave a smile and felt the determination in her heart solidify.</p>
<p class="cnM1MmFlNDQ0YjY2OTQ1NGVhNDdjYzQzMGZkZDI5ZjI4">She was so <em>close</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmYyZDEyNjAwYTQ4MTc5YjRkN2RjNjExNjZhMjgx">So <em>close </em>to getting revenge.</p>
<p class="cnMwYmEwMGE0M2JlYzRhYTlhYThhNTNlOTk0MzY3MjY1">So <em>close </em>to Serena Halen.</p>

      <description>Chapter Twenty-Nine: Polina’s Confusion</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM4OTBlNGI4N2I3MjQxMTA5MWQ3OTMwNjI2ZmMxZGMw"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Mel POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/mel.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWY0ZTU2NDUzZDRhNzBiNmJmOTAyNTBkOGU0M2Ri">Mel paced in front of the door to the training room. Back and forth she went, too distracted in her thoughts to stop. Her throat was constricted and she felt like she wanted to be sick. A pit of anxiety had formed in her stomach that gnawed at her mental state. She wanted desperately just to run away.</p>
<p class="cnNlMDA1NDY2YmY2YjRiNDI4MTdiYjE0N2ZjNjY1OGI1">Unfortunately, running away was tricky while her broken arm was wrapped in a sling.</p>
<p class="cnM1M2UyODVhMDkyNjRiMmQ5NWU2OGEwN2M0MDU1MTE4">For the third time, she raised her fist to knock and for the third time, she hesitated. Beyond that door were not one, not two, but <em>three</em> Speakers! How was she supposed to be able to handle that!</p>
<p class="cnNjM2IwM2ZmMDhiMDQ1NmQ5M2E1ZTY3YWM2NDA2M2U3">“You can do it, you can do it…” she muttered to herself like a mantra. She squeezed every bit of mental strength she could muster and knocked on the door.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTJhYmUxODc4MTQwNTVhMTYxMDQ0MjJmMDZmMmM1">There was no answer.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDNiOTQ2M2JiYTRjOWFiZjFhMmIyZTFkNTk1OWE5">Of course there was no answer. This training room was a private area for instructors and Speakers. She knew about the famous sound-blocking enhancements covering its thick wooden walls. She reached down and before her instincts could stop her, she opened the door and stepped through.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjQyMmJlYWJhOTQxZTk4OGFkMDAxYTUzNjI1Njkx">Unexpectedly the training room looked like nothing special. It was also questionably quiet. Too quiet. For a moment, Mel considered she might be in the wrong place but then she caught sight of a man eating training buns to the side. He spotted her and waved, then gesturing for her to come over.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDZkNGZhOGI4MzRiMmRhMzFjZWMyODU1NGE2OGQ5">Further into the room, Mel saw three people - two demons and a human - sitting silently on the sand in a meditative pose. It was the grandmaster, Speaker Halen, and the individual who broke her arm.</p>
<p class="cnNiMWI4ODkxYjRiYjQwNjlhZjkyNGNlNWI5YWQwZGU3">Speaker Thornheart.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjZiMzE0N2YyMDQ4NTM4ZDZlNTdhMDMzMjFkNGUw">Mel approached the man who had waved at her, glad to have some instruction to follow as opposed to standing around awkwardly. She recognised him as part of the trio that had been coming in most days to train. As she walked over, she couldn’t help but note that he didn’t feel like a swordsman. Was he a mage? Another Speaker?</p>
<p class="cnNmN2Q2YzJjYzFiNDQ1ZDJiNWE0YTNhMmE0ZDUzMTEz">“Hello,” she whispered.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWI2M2M5Y2Y2MTQxMDc5MjFiZmZiM2YwMjllMDUw">“Hello, sit down,” the man gestured to the floor, “They should stop for lunch soon. Are you hungry?” He offered her a bun as she settled into a respectful <em>seiza</em> position. Mel took the food with her good arm, not knowing how to refuse. She couldn’t bring herself to take a bite, feeling like she would throw anything she ate back up.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2FkYWU3NDM1ZTRkNjc4YmZjYjRkNDViOWI3N2Vh">“Thank you,” she said, her voice slightly breaking. “Ahem! My instructor told me to come here at this time to, um… apologise.” She looked at the floor, feeling small and naive. She shouldn’t even be in this room! It was a room for monsters. For true masters!</p>
<p class="cnNiM2RhMDdhN2ViMjRhZDFiN2UxNGRlYmE3M2YwNDVl">“Ah… you’ll be the trainee Serena told me about. Well, Amelia sure gave you a beating, didn’t she? How’s the arm?” He flashed Mel a friendly smile.</p>
<p class="cnM0MzJmMGU5NTYwMTQ4ZDQ4MDE5YTk5OWIzMGY4ZjRl">Mel blinked a few times at the man’s straightforwardness. “It’s, uh, well…” How was she supposed to answer this? “... Broken,” she finished before giving herself a mental slap for the lacklustre response. Thankfully, the man seemed to be in a somewhat cheerful mood. He didn’t seem to be training. What was he here for?</p>
<p class="cnMwMTRiMTg2ZTA5ZTRiY2U4YTdiNzJiOGZiMGNlYTQ5">Questions she couldn’t and wouldn’t ask.</p>
<p class="cnM0MWE5ZDlmYTJkNjQwMmE5MjQxZTkxY2Y3NzY2NDYw">“You needn’t worry much,” the man said, popping the last bit of a bun in his mouth and swallowing. “Amelia has a kind heart. She feels terrible about what she did. I’m sure she’ll heal you in a- ah, here they are!”</p>
<p class="cnNmNzEwMGVkZTBlMzRhYzc4YjZkZWJjYWE0NjAyYTVm">Mel scrambled to her feet and offered a deep bow to the approaching trio. With only one arm she couldn’t manage traditional Manwese etiquette so she placed her good hand on her hip and bowed in the Samino style.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjVkMGI2ZTM1MzQ1YzFiY2VmMjlkY2MzNTBjNTg1">“Trainee Mel, welcome,” came the gruff voice of the grandmaster.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDg4ZDllNzE1MTRjMTg5Mjc2MjE3ZDY3MmIxMGU4">“Hello again!” came the chirpy voice of Speaker Thornheart.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjZiZmU5MzRiMTRhYjZiNmE2MjM3Y2VhNGUwOWE2">She heard nothing from Speaker Halen and when she straightened her posture, she was greeted with a pair of terrifying crimson eyes that stripped away her ego and left her naked and hollow. What a fool she had been to provoke the ire of such a <em>noble</em> demon.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTJhOTFjMjk3ZDRlNTdiMGVmZjEyMzNjMmY2MTU3">“Tsk! So this is the one that insulted House Halen with such impudent arrogance?” Speaker Halen snapped at her, putting one hand on her hips and another on the hilt of her training sword. For a moment, Mel thought she would pass out from the sheer <em>presence</em> of Speaker Halen.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjI5YjA1YzU5MTQ3ZTM5ZDFhZGQ2MDMxNDljMmZk">“I- I’ve heard of your great achievements,” Mel rambled, “I think- think you’re a huge inspiration to others. And me, of course. I-I wanted to apol- apolo-” Mel swallowed the lump in her throat and forced the words out. “Apologize for my thoughtless words the other day. I’m very sorry!”</p>
<p class="cnM5MTM3ZDIxNmJlYTQ2M2I4ZjljZjUyYWVhNmVkNTAy">“Bah! What an awful apology,” Speaker Halen clicked her tongue, turning her head slightly away as she looked down on Mel. “And what do you have to say to Speaker Thornheart?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDhiYmU3YzMwNzQ0NGJiMjhjZDEwZDI0OWEwNTM5">Mel glanced at the human Speaker who gave her a silent wave and a friendly smile, entirely contrasting Speaker Halen’s presence. “I’m very sorry!” She blurted out, bowing quickly again. “I failed to conduct myself properly as a trainee officer!”</p>
<p class="cnNlMTdiMmRjZmI5NzRjMTJhNDJlMmExZDNlYjllMmJj">“You should make her grovel,” Speaker Halen said coldly. “I would have broken both her arms if I were in your position. And a few ribs. Tsk! To speak to a Speaker like that…”</p>
<p class="cnNjMWRjOTQ1ZTcyODRhODk4MDE0MGQzM2IxMGFjZDhj">“Oh, stop it!” Speaker Thornheart suddenly piped up, turning away from Mel and addressing Speaker Halen. “She’s gone white as a ghost! You’re-”</p>
<p class="cnM1NjQwNGNiNjBmZDQwYTk4M2RhMWU5ZjczNzEzYmY3">“Why are ghosts white?” Asked the man sitting down. He was staring at Speaker Thornheart with a confused expression. Despite her confusion at being defended by the one she offended, Mel couldn’t help but also wonder where that expression came from. Was it a human culture thing?</p>
<p class="cnM2MDkyMmNkMmNjOTRkNGZiZTk3N2U3YTgxMWFhNTkz">“Wha-” The human Speaker also looked confused. “What colour are they supposed to be? Wait, never mind! The point is that Mel feels bad about what she said! No need to torture the poor girl!”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjQ2NjIxZDdiMTQwMjhiNmE1ODYxNjQxZTU1ZTkz">Mel couldn’t help but wonder at Speaker Thornheart calling her a <em>girl</em>. She was twenty-one herself, and if she wasn’t mistaken the human looked even younger than her. If she had to guess she would say Speaker Thornheart was as young as eighteen!</p>
<p class="cnNmYjRlOTU2NGQxODQxNWJhYmIxZGUxNTQ2MjU5MjBm">No, that wasn’t possible. The human was a <em>Speaker</em>. No one could become a Speaker so young. She must have used her human healing powers to make herself youthful. How old was she really? Forty? Fifty? She didn’t act like she was older.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWExMmQyYmEyODQ2YTg4NzI1YzBiOTdiNjU3MWNm">“Whatever,” Speaker Halen rolled her eyes. “Hurry up and heal her, then. I’m hungry, and seeing her here pisses me off.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNWI4MTdmYmQ2YTRlNDViNDViZjFiNzQ2MzgyYTE1">“O-okay!” Speaker Thornheart stuttered before turning to Mel with a smile.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2Q2YjMyOGJhMjQ2YzE5ZTliYmVlM2IwNzUwNmZl">Mel was about to ask if she needed to do anything but before she could get the words out Speaker Thornheart started to <em>glow</em>. It wasn’t the warm glow of a gas lamp or the white glare of an aetherlight. It was the glow of <em>magic</em>. Speaker Thornheart’s golden hair shone with aether, and her blue eyes intensified to a shade that Mel could only describe as beautiful.</p>
<p class="cnMwZWE5ZDE3ZjhkZDRhMTdiMzYzZGFlOGZlYzlkODli">She had never been this close to a mage casting a spell and for the first time she understood what it meant to detect the formation of magic that took place within the body. As Speaker Thronheart twisted and moulded her aether Mel could sense it folding into the spell structure. Mel might not be a mage herself, but there was no doubt about the unbelievable amount of <em>skill</em> that Speaker Thornheart was demonstrating.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjA3M2ZjODZlZTQ3OTJhMTRiY2Q2NGRiOTM4YWNi">A moment passed and golden light with - if Mel wasn’t seeing things - blue flecks flew from Speaker Thornheart and entered Mel’s body. She braced herself for pain, but instead experienced a feeling of <em>warmth</em> and <em>love</em> that caused her mouth to drop open. She wasn’t being struck by the human’s magic, she was being <em>embraced</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDQzMGNkY2RhZjRmNjQ4N2FiOTgzYzIxOWNhMTRj">As the <em>kindness</em> rippled through her body, one thought came to mind.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2Q5MTc1ZjkwMDRjOWI5MGQxNzVhNDQzNDI3Zjgz"><em>Seven hells, I’ve become such a bitch,</em> Mel thought.</p>
<p class="cnM1Nzc3ZDM0YmU5NDRjNTBhMzg0NzE4OGVmM2Y1MWMy">She always snapped and argued with her brother. Where was the caring and supportive younger sister who would cheer him on while he trained? She mocked and bullied those weaker than her to impress her friends. Where was the girl who used to gossip and giggle about boys she and her friends fancied? When had she let such darkness into her heart?</p>
<p class="cnM0MWI2ZjkxMzFhZjQ5MDRiMjAyNzdkOTExY2U0MDUy">As the magic dissipated and her feeling of self returned, Mel looked at the human in open wonder. How unfair it was that demonkind had no gods of healing! She glanced down and tentatively moved her arm. She slowly pulled it out of its sling and straightened it. Still feeling fine, she began to flex her arm.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDk5YTU1MzUwYzRlZGE4N2E5MDUyYzczOWRkNmJi">It was completely healed.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGMwMDkzZDIwZDQ2OWZhZmI5MDI1ZjgxM2NiNDdi">No, it was stronger than ever before!</p>
<p class="cnNiNmM2YmYxMzg3NTRkMThiZDk4MmJlMDEwMmE4MTA1">“That’s amazing…” she mumbled. “I don’t know how to-”</p>
<p class="cnM4NDNhNjA0MTgzYjQ5OTE4OGI3NmNiODNkODA2OGVh">“Don’t worry about it!” Speaker Thornheart chirped before giving Mel a thumbs-up. “Just be a lot nicer to people from now on, okay?”</p>
<p class="cnM4Mzk0M2NhMjVhMjQ4NDNhM2M5NTJiNDdhNDFhMmJh">“I… Yes. Thank you, Speaker,” Mel bowed deeply to Speaker Thornheart. She felt a profound sense of gratitude towards the benevolent human. The person she was a week ago would have scoffed if someone had told her she would be thanking a <em>human</em> so sincerely, but here she was.</p>
<p class="cnNiMGJhZjg1OWZhMTQ2NzRiOGFlNGQyYTg2MWEwMTg4">“Trainee Mel,” the grandmaster intoned softly, “Not many demons alive can say they have experienced human healing magic. You’re extremely fortunate to be granted her kindness, aren’t you?”</p><span class="cjIwYmEyNGViZDNkNzRiY2ZhOGM4ODdlMjcyZTM5OTU5"><br/>This novel is published on a different platform. Support the original author by finding the official source.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkMDRhMzA0ZWIyZDRjNTQ5OWU5MTU3NTM3ODUyNTk3">“Yes, Grandmaster,” Mel replied as she straightened up.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjk5M2JmZWNiODQwZWQ4Mjk4MjM4YTRjMzFhNTJk">“That said…” the grandmaster rubbed his beard, “It would be best if you <em>minimised</em> Speaker Thornheart's healing, should you ever talk about it. I’m sure your arm feels perfect right now, but keep it in a sling for another week. Do you understand, Trainee Mel?”</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2RlZTRmMWMwZjQwZjNhYTJlMTFjYTEyZGZlOTJk">“... Yes, Grandmaster,” Mel replied, “I understand.”</p>
<p class="cnNjN2VkNjFkYzRiNDQzOGZiZDcyZGE5NDkxMjJlYTUx">“Return to your lessons now,” the grandmaster said. “Work hard, and your talent will take you to new heights.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NmRiZjJkNDEzNzQ4NDE4OTU2YWJmOTQzNGJlNWUz">“Bye!” Amelia waved.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzAxNDUwODQ1MDQ5MWQ4ZGZjOGM4YTFlNmU2ZGZj">“See you,” said the man.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDhiYzNkZjdmZTQ2MmM5MWZkOTUwOGVlY2NkZjk0">“Tsk!” Speaker Halen glared at her.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmZkMjBjZWViNjRhYWFhMWE0NzM0ODk1NzlhMGYx">Thanking them again, Mel exited the training hall. As she walked back through the corridors to her lessons, a new-found vigour formed in her mind. She <em>would </em>work hard. She <em>would</em> break through to orange, and then yellow, and then after all that she would challenge Speaker Thornheart again after she communed the First Word! She would fight her as equals!</p>
<p class="cnMxMzAzM2IxMWViZDRkOTI5OGIwZmI2YmQ0YjA1NDZh">She would show her what it meant to be a true swordsman!</p>
<p class="cnMxNDRlN2YyOWU1YjRlYTY5MTY1NjM4MDM3ZDNhMzI5"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNzk2MzQ0MzZlMjQ4NzJhMmNlMTZjMDFkMWNlMmI5"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Polina POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/polina.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGExN2IwMDY4NzRjYjhhZTA1ZDAxNzdmMjk4MjVj">Polina paced outside the cafe. Three days had passed since she last met Amelia, and now it was time for their second meeting. Under her tongue, the hard wax capsule was a constant reminder of the danger she was in. She took a few deep breaths and double-checked the green flag hoisted in a doorway at the end of the street.</p>
<p class="cnM4NWM0MzUzYjZlYTQ0MDc5ZjliOGJmN2VkNTgzMWY5">Green meant the meeting was going ahead. Green meant Serena Halen hadn’t followed Amelia. Green meant she could be calm. She forced herself to stop pacing and leaned against a wall. She didn’t have to wait long.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjQxYjAxMTI3YTQ0OTQ4MzY5NDdjNzBhMjI5ZGQx">“Hello!”</p>
<p class="cnM1NTM2YmU5ZDJkMDQ1NjI4ZGU2NmIwMzA5NzkyNzFh">Polina turned to see Amelia bouncing up to her with a smile. In Amelia’s eyes, Polina saw no deception or hostility. This was great, as it meant whatever investigations they had done on her in the last three days had come up clean. Or, they hadn’t, and Amelia hadn’t been told. The latter was one of the worst-case scenarios, and the thought of it prompted Polina to wiggle her tongue to assure herself the poison was still there.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDAwZjgyMTU3YTQ0Mjc4ZTZhNWU4YjJmM2IyYjlk">She had questioned Natalia Marakova over the effectiveness of the poison in the situation where Amelia was there to heal her. She had been assured that what was in the capsule was specifically formulated to resist magical interference. Apparently, it would take a titanic amount of healing energy to overcome. If Amelia did try to heal her it would be meaningless.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWI1OTAyZjIxYTQxNTI5NjNjNTYzN2E0YTQ5NzA2">“Hi there,” Polina said, with a smile that wasn’t completely fake. Regardless of whether Amelia was a traitor to humankind or not, she <em>was</em> rather friendly, and it was difficult not to respond in kind to the woman’s cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="cnNlY2NiNWY0ZWM0MzQwZmVhNzE5NmNjYWI1NDk0MWI3">“Shall we get going? I only have a few hours before I have to be somewhere,” Amelia said. “Or, do you want to get a coffee first? My treat?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDgyNWFlYzE2YjQzYWViMGQ3ZjQ0Y2Q4ZGRlZTQ4">“Uh, no, that’s all right, thank you,” Polina had been told to avoid eating and drinking lest she accidentally swallow the capsule. “If we could head to the market immediately, that’d be ideal. Do you need to get anything?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ODFjOGYzNDFmMzRkNmZhNWYxMzk4NWE5ZWIxOTRl">“Yeah!” Amelia gave her a thumbs up as they began walking to the tramlines. “I’m going to buy a huge bag of Jimari coffee beans! For the ship!”</p>
<p class="cnMwNTBkOTA5NTE4YzRhZDZiOWM4MDc5NTdlMzBmNzA2">Ship? She must be talking about <em>The Vengeance</em>. “What kind of ship?” Polina asked.</p>
<p class="cnMyY2Q1ZGZjMzVmYTRlNmU4NDNiOWM5ZmNhODYwNTBl">“Ah, it’s a military ship. Called <em>The Vengeance</em>. I’m helping Lady Halen with her duties! Lots of need for a healer on a military ship, you see…”</p>
<p class="cnMzNzMyN2FlMzgyZjRkZjliNDUzYTY3NzU5ZWYzYjEy">Polina’s blessing reassured her there was no lie in Amelia’s words. “That’s amazing. <em>The Vengeance</em> is famous! Even us merchants have heard about it. Are the stories true, what they say?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNjM1OGY2ZGUzMjQ2OWJhMjVmMjJkOTgxY2E4ODlj">“Oh?” Amelia hopped on a passing tram and held out her hand to help Polina up. “What kind of stories do they tell?” Polina clambered onto the tram, and the pair of them settled in some seats.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTg3MTA0NGFlMzQ5ZGY4NjBhMDY0OWI0M2I2NWM1">“Stories like... the ship can sail through the lumina to the fabled <em>undersky</em>! Is that true?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzNhY2UyYmRhYjRkYzc4Y2IxZWUwNGRlMDA0Yjcx">“Hmm… I don’t think it can do that much…” Amelia looked thoughtful. Her answer wasn’t definite either way. What level of trust did she have with Serena Halen? Polina needed to figure out how embedded Amelia was in the Cascadian military structure.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzRmNTc2OWFjMzRkZDU5ZjFjMjgxMGZhMDBmYmM3">“I heard merchants saying there’s a creature living in the ship's walls. They say it eats crew members that don’t work hard enough!”</p>
<p class="cnNiZWY3MDcyZDAwMjQ5ZTk4YTViYjVlMDI4NzJhZjg2">“Pfft!” Amelia giggled, “That’s not true! Anathor is <em>lovely</em>. I don’t think he even needs to eat.” That wasn’t a lie. At the very least, Amelia did appear to have a benevolent opinion of the Formless’s nature.</p>
<p class="cnMzY2ZhMDVlNjRlMzQ4YTk4ODc4NzA1MTIzNzMwYWM2">“My ship is so boring and cramped! It must be so <em>amazing</em> to be on such a big ship. How did you end up being employed by Lady Halen?”</p>
<p class="cnNiOGMxYmU4MzQxYTRjYmE5ZDkzMjFjOWFlYTQwNDBh">“It’s a story you wouldn’t believe!” Amelia grinned, and Polina let her eyes show desperation as her blessing told her Amelia believed that to be true. “I guess you can say it was by pure chance! I didn’t even have a say in the matter!”</p>
<p class="cnM4YWViZTZhYTU5MjQ5Y2Y4Mjk2N2FmODIyZjM1ZjYz">“You didn’t have a say? Were you captured!?” Polina knew captives could develop attachments to their kidnappers. Is that what happened here?</p>
<p class="cnNlZDYwMDA0NjJhYTRlZTM4NjI5ODhjZWVhMjVlOTRl">“Heh… we had a rocky start, me and Lady Halen,” Amelia rubbed her nose, “But we’re all good now. I get paid a fair wage and get to experience a lot of new things!”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjA4MjMyYTczOTRjMjE4ODRiZGJiZjZmM2EzOThm">“You want to travel?” Polina asked, and seeing Amelia nod further asked if she had any places she wanted to visit if she had the chance. By asking this, she could indirectly verify places Amelia had never been.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzA1MmRiYjA1YzQ1Njg4ZmE4NjNiYjBmNmM0MDI0">“Loads of places! I want to go east to the Three Sisters! That’s where Lady Halen’s family is based!” Amelia started, her face becoming very excited and her body animated. “There’s also a gigantic creature underneath the Cascadian Basin I want to visit!” Polina nodded. She’d seen photographs of the Cascadian Titan’s skull.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDlkMDZlZmZmOTQwNzViZTkwYjUyYzg5ZTY1ZjAz">“There’s the desert in the south! Apparently they ride these animals called <em>sandskimmers</em>,” Amelia spread her arms wide, “That glide over the desert sands! Oh, oh! I also want to visit the Far West! See how they grow loqua berries under the green moon! Apparently, it’s hard to get permission…”</p>
<p class="cnNmM2IxMzdmOTc0OTQ2M2Q5ZjQxMzA4YzlhYzM2Mjk1">“There’s <em>sandskimmers</em> in the Endless Sands,” Polina said, “I rode one when I was a child. They’re amazing animals,” seeing Amelia’s eyes grow wide, Polina recounted the story of when she’d had the opportunity to ride one of the creatures.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzY0ZWU4YTMzOTRkNGNhYTk0MzI0M2QyMzEzODhl">“Ah, you’re so lucky…” Amelia sighed, “I’ve only ever seen Kenhoro!” That was the truth, so Polina took the opportunity to chase down some information.</p>
<p class="cnNkNGY1YmY1YTZjOTQ1Nzg4NzU5ODI0ZTQ0NmEzMjNi">“You were born here?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MDM2NWVhY2UwODQ2YTVhMjIwOGI4OGRhMzQ4NGE2">“No, I just meant Kenhoro is the only place in the Empire I’ve ever visited!”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDIxOWE1NWE5NDQ3ZTdhY2NlMDA0Njc2NDUzYjU0">“So, were you born on the human continent then?”</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2IwYzg5OTc0ZDQwZDRhODNiZTcwY2FlOTdlMjVi">“Yup!” Amelia chirped.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTZhMjBlOWFmMDRiZGI5ZGMwN2EwOTZlY2UzMGUw">It was a lie.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGQwMTk4MGEyNDRlNWQ5NGMxMWY2ZDc3NTkxOWRj">“I was born in Karligard! After I understood my healing abilities, I sort of just… wandered around alone until I chanced upon Lady Halen!”</p>
<p class="cnM1OWU5MTMwMDViZDQ1YjA5YTI4YjE5MzZhNGM1MjFh">More lies. Polina resisted a frown. If she wasn’t born on the human continent and she had only visited Kenhoro, then where was she born? She didn’t have the look of a native of the Sabanis Dominance. Was she from one of the floating islands? Maybe she was from Mur?</p>
<p class="cnMwOWQyYjlhNDM2ZTRmMjk4NDVlNjhkYjU0OTM0ZTRk">Most puzzling of all. Why would she lie? Was she protecting someone, or was someone instructing her to lie for another reason?</p>
<p class="cnM4OTc1MjdmNDQ0MDRjMmI4ZWNkN2ZlZTNjNGI2MDlm">“It must have been hard,” Polina answered, trying to sound sympathetic. “To be alone for so long. What kind of places did you visit while travelling from Karligard?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MzJjYTQyMTkzMDRjMTJhYTZjMDU1ODZmZThkZTg4">“Ah… I sort of wandered through Christdom a lot. I never really visited any cities as I wanted to avoid the Church. Then I kept going south, and the rest is history…” Amelia shrugged. Her words were lies and knowing that Polina could tell they were practiced lies that were spoken a little too mechanically.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDg4YjQ2MDY4MTQ5MjA5OTA2YWE4YmUwMDVkYjUw">“Why did you want to avoid the Church?” Polina asked, “They would have given you a life of luxury! They still would!” Her voice raised slightly at the end, and she had to quickly bottle her rising emotions. “Sorry,” she whispered.</p>
<p class="cnM3Njg4NTA1MTBjZDQwZDBiZWJmNWM2NjZkNzFkZTIz">“It’s okay,” Amelia said. “I suppose it must seem strange. But there’s not much difference whether I’m up there healing humans or down here healing demons and humans, right?”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDljODA0NzZhZjRkM2ZhMDQ2ZTFjNzMyNjJmMTk0"><em>Of course there’s a difference!</em> Polina wanted to shout but resisted the urge. “Do you really think there’s no difference? Despite the… conflict?”</p>
<p class="cnNlYTEzYTgzZjVkOTQzN2M5Y2NlMzQ1NzhiMTVlNTBl">Amelia shook her head. “Not really. Did you attend the moonrain festival the other day?”</p>
<p class="cnNmYmFlNTUxZGVjYzQxYTA4OWQ5Y2QyODQ3MTNkY2Y3">“No,” Polina said. She was forbidden from partaking in anything like that unless it was a part of the mission.</p>
<p class="cnM4NjMyYjU3OTRlZDQwNDFiOGE5YTUxOTA0M2Q5ZWJm">“Well, I did. We followed the procession for the first bit. It was amazing, there were colourful costumes and dancing and drinking and…” Amelia trailed off, “Anyway, the point is, guess what I saw?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMTkyMDY1NTZmZTQwNTNhNDhlYjcyODU1ZGJlNmY5">“What?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMzk0NGUxYmQ4NDQ2YWFiMGYwOTgyY2JjYjFhZWFj">“Demon and human children playing and dancing in the streets! They looked adorable and they were throwing coloured chalk at each other. They were laughing and playing! You know what that means?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMzhiYTQ0NzI5OTQ2ZDM5MWRhMGZjNGZkYjliY2Zl">“... What does it mean?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMjE5N2EyOTgwZjQyNzdiY2IwN2JlODVkNDZiOGVh">“It means any distrust or conflict between demon and humankind is <em>learned</em>. Those children playing with each other will only grow up to hate each other if other adults <em>teach</em> them that! Who cares if one person has a pair of horns and the other doesn’t? We all feel the same emotions for the same reasons…” Amelia was quiet for a moment. “And that’s why I’ll heal whoever I want when I want,” She turned and looked Polina directly in the eyes, “So it’s not a problem, right?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNDM0NzAzZGU3ZDQzNzRiMzc4MWM5YTNjMjNiZGM2">Polina knew she was being asked if <em>she</em> thought it was a problem. The honesty of Amelia’s candid take on human-demon relations had thrown Polina into a pit of confusion. Just who was this fellow human?</p>
<p class="cnNhMGEyOGQwNGNiYjQyNjM4OWJiMmUzZTE0MDcyZWUw">“I suppose not… it’s just… not a lot of people share the same views as you do…”</p>
<p class="cnMwMzFiZDVjZWJjZjRjMTJhYmFjYjAzZjIxOGI4NWMx">“Well then!” Amelia exclaimed, sounding a lot more cheerful, “It’ll be down to me to start changing people's minds then, won’t it? Come on, this is our stop!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNzRiZGJkZGM5MDRiMmNiMzUzMjViYjdmNmY4Yzgx">They hopped off the tram and headed to the central market. During which Polina tried to get answers from Amelia but the signals her blessing gave her were causing even more confusion. She asked Amelia who had taught her healing spells, and her truthful answer was <em>no one</em> did. This was supposed to be impossible. Training even a talented human into a healer was extremely skill, resource, and time-intensive. It wasn’t something that you could just do by yourself.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGI0ZWMzZWMzNDQyMjFiNjk1MTllMDZmOWY1OTMw">Was her blessing broken?</p>
<p class="cnMyZjk2YTUxOWJmZjQ2Y2NiYjk5NGVmYzhhYjE0ZmYz">As she slipped in questions here and there, Polina grew more and more confused. Amelia, who came from nowhere and had never visited anywhere apart from Kenhoro for a week, had somehow developed a comprehensive understanding of healing magic. To make matters worse, Amelia told her she was only <em>twenty-five</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzMxNzM1MmZhNTQ2YjNhYmY5MjA3MmIxYjI5Y2Q0">Had she just fallen out of the sky?</p>
<p class="cnMxNTkzNzJhYjczNDRhMTU4ZDM4YzY3OTA4ZTNiNDgx">One thing was sure, Amelia’s accent was definitely Centralis Imperial. She spoke like a native, yet every answer she gave around the subject indicated she had never been in or near Centralis.</p>
<p class="cnNlMGMzNTJmNThlMTQ3ODM4MzhjOWRiNDU2MWM1ODE2">It made no sense.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjk3Mzc4YWQ2NzQ3YzdhNWVmOTM1NDJkODBlMWYy">One thing she could confirm is Amelia was <em>not</em> in the military, nor was she a citizen. Apparently, she was planning to become a citizen of Cascadia as soon as possible. Not only a citizen, Polina was sure they would make her a Cascadian Lord.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDMyYTczZWQ3NTQyY2Y5ZDI0ZDFjNzFjNDk0ZDk0">Amelia asked plenty of her own questions and Polina politely answered. Amelia seemed to love stories and adventure so she would mix in a few tales of her real experiences adjusted on the fly to fit with her fake identity.</p>
<p class="cnNiMGNlYjAwMjc5YjRmYzViYWYyNDI3NTIxNWFiOGIy">“Oh, Tatiana! This was what you wanted, right?” Amelia guided her to a paper and ink stall, where Polina bought a hundred sheets of paper and a few bottles of ink. This action wasn’t just part of her cover story; she’d been told the entire team would be spending much of the time they had on the way back writing reports.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTZkZTViMzNmNTQ3NDA4NGE0YjMxMGJjOWRiMWIx">She sighed. Polina didn’t want to leave. She couldn’t leave. How could she head back now after coming so close to Serena Halen? Although she didn’t think Amelia was necessarily a <em>bad</em> person, it made her sick when she heard the woman speak of Serena Halen with such kindness. Did she not know the actions that monster had taken? The people she had killed?</p>
<p class="cnM2M2MyOGQ3OGYxOTQ4M2Q5ZmY4YzlkNDY4ZjJkNGE3">“What’s up?” Amelia asked, “You looked sad suddenly?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDAxZGZkNzRhYjQ5YWI4OTg3NDRjN2E5Zjc1ZjNi">“Ah, I was just thinking I have so much work to do I’m not sure if we’ll be able to meet again…” Polina mumbled the prepared and practised line.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2JiZGRjMTIxNDQ1YmQ5M2ZkOWE3MjZhYjE5ZGU1">“Oh no! Are you heading back north?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNmVlMjQ3NDAyNDQyYWViMzA3NTNlNmM0ODEwMjY0">“That’s right. Merchant traffic shuts down in two weeks, so we’re leaving before then.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MTE5YjJiMzgzMTQ0MmI4NzQ4NGMwNTQyOGY0YmVl">“It must be tough, being a merchant,” Amelia said, “You travel to all these places but never really settle down anywhere!”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjdiMzg2MDgyYjQ2YTE5MmEwNTljOTY0ODdlN2Ix">“Yes… it’s difficult…” Polina answered.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzY3YTVlM2ZhZTQ3OTE4ZTIxYzI0NTUxNTRkMjMx">“Well, if you ever have free time, come find me!” Amelia chirped and told Polina what inn she and Serena were staying in. Polina knew the inn already, although the field team hadn’t assigned anyone to watch it directly. It was too dangerous to tail or observe a Speaker like Serena Halen. They would be detected almost immediately.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTM4NTQ1ZWQ3NDQ5NjNiZGIzN2VmM2QyY2Y3ZDk0">Amelia found a stall selling sacks of coffee beans and she bought a huge bag of Jimari beans. Polina couldn’t help her eyes going wide at the amount of money Amelia carried. It made sense as she must have been paid a tremendous amount for her healing capabilities.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDQyYWRjZmExZjQxNzRiZmVjMDlhMGFlYTBiN2E3">After all, demonkind didn’t have any gods of healing.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzlhZjU5ZTkzZTQwZjBhOGE3MTM3OTBmMGViZjJh">They took the tram back to the cafe, and Polina bought a coffee which Amelia insisted on paying for. She avoided drinking it, instead standing and holding it in her right hand. A signal to the team that everything had gone okay. She didn’t know who, but someone sitting inside or outside the cafe would be someone under Natalia Marakova’s instruction.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzY5N2NmMDNhYjRhYWQ4Zjk0NmUyYTQ0YmNiOGQ0">Bidding farwell to Amelia, Polina returned to the merchant ship where she was thoroughly interrogated for hours until every tiny detail had been repeated a dozen times. At the end of it, she was exhausted and simply collapsed onto her assigned bunkbed.</p>
<p class="cnM0OWVhM2Y0NjJjOTQ2YjRhMjExODJiMGQ1Yjg5MTcw">Getting revenge was tiring.</p>

      <description>Chapter Thirty: The Second Word of Divinity</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNkMzFlZWE5ODRiYjRhYmU5NWY3ZWRlMjM0Nzg3MmU1"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM0MDU2OGQ3ZDE3ZTQ4OGE4MjY3YTMxNWI1YzA5OWVm">For the next week and a half Amelia followed a simple schedule. First, she would wake up in Serena’s arms and give her a blast of healing magic. Serena had remarked that she suspected her body might be getting younger as a side-effect, although she wasn’t sure. The pair of them decided to keep an eye on things.</p>
<p class="cnMyMTRiNGY2NzYwOTQxZDY4NDJkYWU0ZWE4NTBjYTYy">The next daily task was washing, followed by breakfast and a morning coffee. Serena had raised an eyebrow when Amelia returned with a twenty-pound sack of Jimari coffee beans but otherwise didn’t say anything.</p>
<p class="cnM0N2Y0YzBjY2Q0MjQ5ZWFiOTNkMDc0YjAxMjZmYTE2">Tomes continued to turn up in the morning and help teach Amelia writing and reading. She was getting good now and could understand more and more complex sentences. She also enjoyed the mathematics books he had brought her and was delighted to find that demons had discovered calculus! Although they used different symbols that felt strange at first, she got used to them. On seeing how proficient she was with numbers, Serena mentioned that her oldest sister, Nina, would get along with her.</p>
<p class="cnM5NmNjNjdhMDIzMTQ3NGI5OTVhYmE2YWZiN2E3N2My">They would then proceed to the academy to train. Amelia never saw Mel again, but she caught sight of her brother once, who only glared at her but otherwise said nothing. As she continued to spar and practice her swings, Amelia was feeling more and more confident by the day. The wooden sword now felt natural in her hands and the grandmaster and Serena were pointing out fewer and fewer mistakes.</p>
<p class="cnMwMmMzOWU4YjM4ODQ4OTc4YTAzMjljOTRmNWQwNDA1">Still, the first aura lay beyond her reach. It was a frustrating experience. Her experience as a mage only made it more challenging to get her aether moving in the unfamiliar ways required for the warrior’s aura. She was making some progress, although Amelia felt like it was happening far too slowly despite both Serena and the grandmaster telling her she was doing great considering the amount of time she had put in.</p>
<p class="cnM5N2VhNjAwZDRiMDQxYmQ4MTM3NDRhMWU4OGFjODk1">“Try imagining a convection current,” Serena said one time.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzI3NDVjNzAyMjRhZTI4MGFhZGFlOWI1N2JmODUw">“A convection current?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjJlZDliYjU5OTQ3YWU4MDQ0Nzc4Y2Y5ODJmYWMx">“Right. When you heat a cup of water from the bottom, the heat travels like this.” Serena scratched a diagram into the ground. “Imagine something similar but instead of heat it’s your aether moving throughout your entire body.”</p>
<p class="cnNhY2Y0NDg3MGNhZjRhZDQ5ZTU2M2ZhYmEzMDgxNTYx">“I tried that! Look!” Amelia focused inwards and flowed her aether around her body.</p>
<p class="cnMwN2RhNTE2NTU5NjQ4MzM4MDY1YTMxY2Y5OGViZTU0">“That’s not the same,” Serena said, “You’re <em>flaring</em> your aether like a mage and relying on your exceptional aether control to move it while it’s agitated. Aura needs a more delicate touch. You need to inject <em>intention</em> into your aether and <em>let </em>it react instead of <em>forcing </em>the expected reaction.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZDViMzhjNTk5ZjRhYjM5NmZjMDdjNjk5NDMwZWEw">That instruction had helped Amelia greatly, and she soon felt she was on the right track. She was given a few more meditative exercises, which she practised as often as possible.</p>
<p class="cnMxMmVlMjE5NjI1ODQ0ZTk4YjQyZDE3NTg5Mzg4NDkz">After training, Amelia would wander around the city with Serena. Sometimes Aiden would join them, although he had a growing list of other tasks that would keep him busy. Now that he had sent off the report about Amelia it was mostly a waiting game for whatever the Cascadian government decided.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzhhN2I1ZGE2YTQ5ZWI5ZjRkODM2ZjdkZjM0MDMz">Serena had been spending more time around the ship as they finished the repairs and installed a new gun turret. The shipment from Ponan had the last vital supplies they needed, and, with the help of the greatlord’s men, they were ahead of schedule.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDRhNTFmYjAyYzQ4NDNiODc5ZjE0OGFlMTM5YzVm">Serena’s weird dreams had stopped, although Anathor had warned them they might return when they left Kenhoro to sail south. Amelia had questioned Serena about the nature of <em>The Vengeance</em>. Was it alive? Did it have a soul? Her questions only received half answers and an apology. Apparently, the answers she wanted were locked behind doors and protected by Serena’s superiors on a need-to-know basis.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjY3MjVkNGZmZDRjOGY5M2JlZWU3MWVhZTcwZDRk">It was a shame Tatiana was too busy to meet up again. Even so, Amelia was happy to make a human friend. Surprisingly, Serena didn’t seem bothered, stating she wasn’t the kind of person to stop her from having friends. She had been suspicious at first, but after her investigation into the merchant came back clean, she didn’t mention Tatiana again other than after their final meeting where Serena made sure Amelia recounted everything she had said ‘just in case you let something slip’.</p>
<p class="cnNmNWZkYTYwNWFiNTQwYjVhNDhjMWFlNjc3YTQwMWY0">They would spend their evenings at the inn, training and chatting. On occasion, they went out for food and drinks. Thankfully, there was no more drama or drunken lords to cause problems.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODFjOWM3MDU4ODQ0NmE5ZGJlNTJiNGE3NWU3NDc0">Then the night would come, and without fail, lips would meet lips, and the fingers and tongues of one of them would have the other giggling and moaning. As the days ticked by, they grew ever more comfortable around each other and Amelia would often not even bother to get dressed anymore when she woke up. Instead, she would lounge around naked while drinking her morning coffee, enjoying both the bitter taste and Serena’s eyes on her.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjAzNWRiZmYwNjQ4YjliZjY0YWEyMzdjZGY5Yjg5">When they finally went to sleep, Amelia would kiss her girlfriend and whisper ‘Goodnight, Ren’ and Serena would whisper ‘Goodnight, Lia’. Their little nicknames became a small ritual that only they would witness every night. A sign of their growing relationship and trust.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDZjMjYyZWI2YjQxZjA4ZDc2MGIxNmVkMzA1Y2Fh">All seemed to be going well until one morning, ten days after she had met Tatiana for the last time, Serena stomped into their room, frustration and worry visible on her face.</p>
<p class="cnMyZTJjZmExODZhMzQzZDE5ZTRlYzA1ZjU1MTJmNDkx">“What’s up?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnMzM2I2NjFmMzMxOTQwNmQ5YmU3M2Y5MjZiOGU2YmE2">“Just overseeing the loading of the new cargo down in the docks, and guess who I bumped into? Or rather, who bumped into me?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MzZlNjA4OTJkMjQxZTA5YWU3ZDIyNzVlMmRlMTIx">“The greatlord?”</p>
<p class="cnMyM2VkNjY0ZjIxNTQxYjA5ZGIyOWU2MDU4MTdkOWY3">“Worse. The <em>Dragon</em> is in Kenhoro.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZDBjZjk1YTgzODQwNzFiODMyOTAxNzVmNzdiMzAw">“So?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMTA1ZTU4ODExYjRhOGViMWQwYjA1ZjU2YzIwZjk4">“So? The man has direct command over the Eastern Admiralty! I’m used to taking my orders from Greatlord Oshiro! That was who swore me into my commission! Bastard…” Serena poured herself a coffee and sat down, mumbling a few curse words.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTE1NDFjOTQ2ZTRlYzdhOTc2N2E0ODEwNDc4YzI0">“I guess he gave you an order?” Amelia asked, sitting up.</p>
<p class="cnM1MmJiNWFkZDQ2OTRjN2I4YzBhYmYxMzZiOWMxMTcw">“Intelligence has detected movements of Christdom Church agents in Kenhoro and Tanhae. The Federation are up to something as well. Kenhoro’s getting hot.” Serena took a sip of the coffee. “The <em>Dragon</em> wants us to take a civilian cutter down to Shimashina, while Dagon will sail <em>The Vengeance</em> towards Ponan before turning south and meeting us.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MmM0ODM1M2MyMDRmYWFhNzJhYjhlNzEwNTEwMDY0">“Why?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YmFmY2M1MzhlMzQ4NzdiZDBmNzNkZGFjN2NhZDYz">“Because, with so many foreign agents poking their noses around, the likelihood that you’ll be attacked or someone will try and kidnap you is too high. There will be Speakers hidden among the enemy agents, and we’ve already had one fight in the city where Words have been Spoken,” Serena said with a thoughtful expression, tapping her horns. “I suspect it’s some kind of counter-intelligence move. I bet they’ll leak where we go through certain channels to identify leaks and see who moves to follow us or <em>The Vengeance</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjA4OGFlMTViMTQ0MDBhNTI0OWU4OTY2MmMzMjI4">“<em>We</em>? I can come with you?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnMxMWJkODc0YmY1NjQ4YTg5YTgyMDgzODA0MDZmNjA3">“Of course,” Serena said. “He all but stated he expected both of us. I think it’s fair to assume the <em>Dragon</em> is aware of our relationship now. Which means…” Serena gave a soft sigh. “My family also knows.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNjAwNmRmNTA4MDQ2ODE5YzVmMDk0YzM4OWRjNjE1">“I can’t wait to meet your family! It’s going to be fun!” Amelia said with a grin.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2I4MDIwNGIyYTQzMzM5MGExNjk2ZmRlODgyNTRm">“<em>Fun</em> is not the word I would use…” Serena muttered.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTVhMzk3ZmNhNzQzZTk5ZGJlODBjNWEyOGMzNTBj">“When do we have to move?”</p>
<p class="cnM0NTUyN2VlY2RlODRkNDU4MmMxMzFiNzUxY2ExM2Y4">“Now.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNWRkODU4NTIyZDRlOWJiOTQ2ZjMyNzI4YzljOWIx">“<em>Now!?</em>” Amelia blurted out. It was so short notice!</p>
<p class="cnMwZTk3ZWU2MmUxYTQyYWI4ZWU0N2U4MTQ5OTg0MjY0">“The cutter waiting for us at the eastern docks is called <em>The Sakamoto</em>. It’s one of the last lines out before travel shuts down tomorrow or the day after. Storms will start hitting the city any day now.”</p>
<p class="cnMzOTkxZmEwNDBmNDQzODZhZjE2ZTNiZDdkMDEyM2I5">“But, but…” Amelia cast her eyes around the room that had begun to feel like a home. “What about our stuff? The masks? My coffee!” She went over and hugged the enormous sack of Jimari beans.</p>
<p class="cnMxZmQzNDA0ZTY2YzQ2NDY4MDYzMThlNjU2MzQ1Y2Nj">“Ha!” Serena scoffed at her actions. “There’s people waiting for us outside. I’ll have them get whatever we miss and put it on <em>The Vengeance</em>. As for us, pack your clothes in a bag.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYzc5NjRlMjZlMTRkODBhYjA3NDUyMjExMTY4ODU0">“This is happening so fast!” Amelia cried, “Do we have rooms on this other ship?”</p>
<p class="cnNmOTU3Nzk3NzJjYzQ3NDJhNGE5Njg5ZDc2ZDkyOTBh">“I don’t know. But it’ll be packed. They probably picked it <em>because</em> it’ll be packed. I bet you whoever’s working behind the ticket office today is an agent in disguise taking notes on whoever has a sudden pressing need to board <em>The Sakamoto</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OTk3MjM2MjRjMzQ0ZDNiN2RjNjcxN2JlZmJkZGZl">“Right, right,” Amelia said as she hurried around the inn room collecting her worldly possessions. She made sure to fill the pockets of some of her clothes with what coffee beans she could, which made Serena shake her head.</p>
<p class="cnM4NmE2MGUzYzc2NzQ2NjlhNGQ0MjEwZGUyMDA0Yjgz">Her girlfriend joined her packing, and within a few minutes the pair of them were downstairs saying goodbye to Mister Weng. After exiting the inn, Serena talked to a mysterious man smoking a cigar.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2ZkNGExNzAwZjRiZTg5MDhkZjQ1NjJmNWIyZWEx">“Can you get the rest of our possessions and get them on <em>The Vengeance</em>?” Serena asked the man.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjU3ZGE3MzIyMTQxZmQ5ZTc0MmE0ODgwYTEwNmY5">“Boys!” he called, and a pair of demons appeared from around the corner. “Go upstairs with Weng and get everything that doesn’t belong to the inn. Get it on the ship!” The pair of demons headed inside, and the man produced two tickets which he handed to Serena.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzJhZjFlNzdmODQzNzJiNTNhNWQ0Mzk3MDEyYTEy">“These are your tickets for <em>The Sakamoto</em>,” he said. “It leaves in an hour, so you’ll need to hurry.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMTZiOTM4ODYzZTQxOWY4MThmYjRkY2MxOTc5MDc3">“Will the ship have an escort?”</p>
<p class="cnMyM2M1NTkwOGQzMTQ1YzE5NzlkN2I0NTBjN2ZjYTU2">“No, not until it gets closer to Shimashina. This is all short notice.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYmVlOTg3M2E0ZjRhZGZiZGRkNmZjYmUzYzE3OWI0">“Right, we’ll be off then.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMDBmYmE3YTI1NzQ2OTY4OTBhZjYxYjkwZDUyYjVj">“Good luck.”</p>
<p class="cnMxN2ZmN2Y3YTY2OTRlNGQ4MWJhMjIzYWViZGJjYjZi">With that, they hurried to catch a tram to the eastern docks. When they arrived, Serena handed over the tickets to the demon sitting inside a windowed office who glanced at the pair of them before stamping them. Amelia wondered if that demon was really an agent in disguise. He looked exactly like any bored minimum-wage worker you could find anywhere.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjJhYjg0YTFiNTRhNzFiNjI5NmZkYTU5NDhiZjM5">Finding the bay <em>The Sakamoto</em> was docked in gave Amelia a shock. It was very different from <em>The Vengeance</em>. The cutter was made entirely of wood and didn’t appear to have a walkable deck. Instead, a gangway led into an opening on the ship's side. It was about half the size of <em>The Vengeance</em> but looked far sleeker.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTY5ODc4NTI4NzRkMDFhZGZmZTdkMDU1ODk2ZjRl">“Cutters are built for speed,” Serena explained, “Lightweight and powerful engines. No armour. We’ll reach Shimashina by tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZWE1MWJiOWYyYzQxZjdiMmUxMDhjNGFlZmE1ZGFh">They boarded the ship, pushing through the other passengers and their luggage. They found their rooms near the engines in the rear of the ship. They knew they were near the engines because they could feel the rhythmic beating of the lift engine sounding from somewhere close by.</p>
<p class="cnNkM2JkNmRmOGNhYTRkNzZhYzk5YjBhYTdlMGM2NDM0">“Guess first class was sold out,” Serena said as she opened the door and peered in. The room was small, with a single tiny bed and a thin table. Amelia’s room was opposite and it was equally compact.</p>
<p class="cnNiOThjZDE0ZGFkNzRlMjRhZmYwMDRlZDAzNmNiNDNi">“Like sardines in a can…” Amelia mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnMzMjY2NzhiNDg2NzQxYmU5ZDI0MDFkYjZjOWM2NTlk">“What are sardines?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNGFiNmI5M2I3NDQ3OGNiYmU5NGIyNmU3MGRmMTQz">“Small fish. Packed tightly together in a can for transport.”</p>
<p class="cnM0OWRlY2E1ZWZhZDQ0OWRhODczNjYxYzJkYzMwOTQ1">“Do they taste good?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OGU3ZDRlOGIxZTRiZmNhZDUwYjViODE0Y2QzYWI0">“... Nah.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTlkYzA1NjYxNjQxYTRiNDgyNWU2NTI2YTZmYmY2"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YTJlY2NiOTI3ZjQ3MjA5NjEzMTNiZTc0NTcwNTI2"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Polina POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/polina.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGE1ZGUzMGYyZDQzZjViMThmZGEzMTRiYTUxYzRj">“<em>The Vengeance</em> is prepping to move. Something spooked them.”</p>
<p class="cnMyM2MyNTFkNjM1NjRjZGZiYjQ0Y2EwNmEyNDY4NTgz">Natalia Marakova snubbed her cigarette into the desk. Polina swallowed nervously. “Do we follow them?” Polina asked.</p>
<p class="cnMyMzAwMjFlZDUwNDQ4NjM4MTkwZDZiZmJmMDM5MjRi">“No,” Marakova waved a dismissive hand. “We do not deviate from the ship’s itinerary. If we do, it’ll blow our cover. We return to Vinay as planned. We have other agents in other cities. They’ll report to us when they see it make land.” She narrowed her eyes at Polina. “Do you have any problems with that, Polina Volkova?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YTQzZGM5YjE2ODRhZTI4NTdmMjJkMmY3YjllMzhh">“No, Team Leader,” Polina said. She knew Marakova was well aware of her personal history with Serena Halen. It was the core reason why Marakova was originally <em>against</em> her coming on this trip. Nevertheless, Polina had been on her best behaviour for the duration of the mission. Never complaining nor deviating from her instructions.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGQxNWQ5MDRhMjQ5OGFiZTBjNzBhZDU3MzcwMmRm">“Target One and Target Two are not sailing with <em>The Vengeance</em>,” Marakova said, prompting a series of murmurs to erupt around the room. “One of our assets has informed us they’re taking a cutter south to Shimashina. A ship called <em>The Sakamoto</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM1Njg3NGYwMGMwZDQ5OTQ5YjU0Mzg2NDVmNDAzOTQz">“Why the split?” One of the men in the room asked.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTg5MTI3MmUxNDRmNjk5MTQ5Nzk0ZDc4OWU4MDY1">“Church Intelligence is in Kenhoro,” Marakova explained, “And you know how sloppy they can be. The information regarding the targets taking different routes is floating around in a few circles. It’s an intentional leak.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZDg2MjAyZDBmMDQ1NDc4MzA0NDA5YTIxY2FkYjVl">“To see who’ll bite?” Polina asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmMGExZmE0ZWRjMTRmZDZiZDYxYTZiMDE2NTMxN2Rj">“Damn straight,” Marakova glared at the room, “And we’re not biting, understand?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNDExMjA4MDcwZDRiOWZiZGE3YWE1ZmE0MWNkNDJl">“Yes, ma’am!” came the chorus of replies.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTU3Y2JiYjA4ZjQ2NzQ4ODA0NTVlMmUxNDEwZjdk">“We’ll rebase ourselves in Vinay until we verify if <em>The Vengeance</em> makes land in Shimashina, and then we’ll plan our next moves. Alright, get to work. We need to get the cargo on board quickly if we’re going to beat the storm season.” As everyone turned to leave, Marakova called out to Polina. “Not you, Senior Volkova. Stay behind for a minute.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYTQwYmFjNmVkMDQ1ZmQ4YWMxZDg2NzkwZTNlMDA3">After the two of them were alone, Marakova slowly took out another cigarette and lit it. The smoke lingered in the air, ticking Polina’s nose.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjU2YmExM2Q2NTQ3ODhhMjU3NTA2MTFjMjI0ODky">“You’ve done good work, Senior Volkova.”</p>
<p class="cnNiZDNhYjQ3Y2JlMzQ4MDE4NzJjYzJjNDMyNzVkMzg2">“Thank you, ma’am!”</p>
<p class="cnNjMjNiMWNhYzlmZTRiNWI4MGU5NmI3NjAwYTYwNDYx">“But your role ends here. Once we reach Vinay, you’ll be heading back to the Bureau. The director has a dozen testimonies he needs you to verify.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZDZlNTNkMGY2YTQyMGM5ZWI0MmU1MjdlNDIzN2Qy">She couldn’t go back! She was so close! “Ma’am…” Polina began to argue her case, but Marakova cut her off.</p>
<p class="cnM2YzJmYjhkMjllMjQyNDI5OWZhYWMxOTIyNzAwNjhj">“You can’t come down south to Shimashina. Your face is known to Target One, and Target Two would have seen a copy of the photograph from your merchant visa.” Marakova clasped her hands together, relaxing back into her chair. “You’ve done good work, but your blessing is too valuable to risk further in the field.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NmI3ZmMyOGU2YTQ4ZGJhYmEwZTBiNThjMjg0ZjE0">Polina didn’t say anything. Her throat had gone dry. What could she say? Marakova seemed to see her predicament and distress as her voice took on a kinder tone. “Look, you’ve demonstrated enough competence and initiative in the field that I’ll recommend that the director open you up to more fieldwork in the future. Is that fair?”</p>
<p class="cnMzYjlhYjI0MTI4YzQ5NTk4OTRmODcyZDdiNWI4NGNj">“Yes… thank you, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="cnM1OTg5ODcwMmY5ZDRjYmM5ODFhNDdjYmI1MmIxMTBm">“Alright, now-” Marakova suddenly cut off, turning her head slightly as her eyes became unfocused. “Do you hear something?”</p><span class="cmViMWU2Zjg5NjJjOTQ3ZDE5NWVmNWI0MWQzZmNmMjcz"><br/>The narrative has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNhMjkwMGNiNGU5MTQ4MzI5NjdmZjMwMDFiOWYzYzYw">Polina focused on her hearing. There was something. It sounded like…</p>
<p class="cnM3NDdhNmNkZGU2YzRkZmJhNGZhNDcyZDkyMDNiYmNm">“Gunshots!” Marakova explained, drawing a revolver from her person.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTMyM2ZjYzI5ZTQ0ZjE5ZTk4YjU4N2U3MDYzNTVl">“Wha-”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGJiOGI0NzMyNTQ4ZTE4ZTBmY2I0YWY0NzBjZmI2">“Silence! Don’t move!” Marakova hurried over to the closed door and pressed an ear to the wood. The gunshots continued, and now the sound of yelling could be heard. “They’ve boarded the ship,” Marakova said with a grimace. She turned and, with a grunt, pulled a bookcase down so it leaned against the closed door.</p>
<p class="cnNmZjhlNDRiYzY3ODRkMWY4ZWQ4MDE4NjRjZjQ5MTIw">“We’re trapped!” Polina exclaimed.</p>
<p class="cnM4NWJmYTE2YzZhZDRkOTE5MGE4NGQwMjk5MmU0ZTcy">“No, we’re not. Go here.” Marakova indicated to the other side of the table, and Polina obliged. For a moment, she thought she was going to help Marakova lift the table to further block the door, but instead, the woman picked up the table herself and <em>threw</em> it across the room to nestle against the door.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTA5NTFiOTBlMTQ3NTg4NDQ3NWZiNGEzNTY4ZDhj">Polina saw a faint red glow emit from Marakova’s skin.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzM3OTA5ZTFhYTRiMmQ4MTQwZGZhZGU5YWVkZDEy">Well, she was the team leader for a reason.</p>
<p class="cnMxMmVmMDQ0OTNiYjQ2ZGI5MWJiNTc2ZGNlZjRmNzJh">“Here,” Marakova said, opening a hidden trapdoor. “No talking from now on, understand? They might have Speakers.” Polina nodded furiously and followed Marakova down through the trap door.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmI5YzU3ZGEyNjQ3OGFiMzRlMjUxNzczZWU2MjRm">It led to a tight and suffocating crawl space where Polina dutifully followed her team leader until they reached the end. She couldn’t see anything but could hear Marakova fiddling with something metal. Suddenly, a beam of light appeared as a hatch in the underhull was opened.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjdlZjlmNjQ4YTQ5NTViNTI3MjM3ZmRjZmNhNTE1">Marakova placed a finger to her lips and exited the hatch on her back with careful, methodical movements. Polina saw there was a rope running alongside the underhull that Marakova was using to shimmy along. Polina took a breath, said a silent prayer and turned onto her back and exited the ship.</p>
<p class="cnNkOGUwMmFjOWQwMDQ2ZGJhNWMwNzYzNWJjNWY1YWY1">The sound of shouting and gunfire could be heard all around her. Polina could hear men screaming, not knowing if they were human or demon. Together, she and Marakova clambered along the underhull, using the rope that had been fed through metal rings lining the lowest point of the ship. Did all ships have these, or was it set up for this purpose?</p>
<p class="cnMzOWYxMTU0MjNlYzQ5YjhiNDAzODFkZmJmNTg1ODE5">Polina swallowed, trying to avoid looking down at the sheer drop underneath them. She focused on moving, putting one hand in front of the other, trying to ignore what would happen if she let go. After what felt like an eternity, she bumped into Marakova, who had stopped. Polina opened her eyes and looked at the team leader who was motioning down.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzk5M2Y1MzA4MDQ0ZmFiYzc1OTM5ZDlkNjYwNjM3">Polina looked down and saw they were above a platform that held the keel blocks at the ship's bow. This was only a drop of a few feet compared to the deadly fall only a few meters the other way. Marakova dropped, landing like a feline, and Polina followed, only letting out the smallest of grunts as her body absorbed the impact.</p>
<p class="cnNiYmE5N2ZlNzlhZTQzYWE5MjU1NjdhMDc0NzJmNDVj">They crouched down and snuck between the keel blocks. Above them, Polina could hear the sounds of someone shouting orders. Marakova tapped her shoulder, and Polina saw that they had come to an iron gate. Marakova produced a key and with a <em>click</em> that sounded awfully too loud, the gate was swung open.</p>
<p class="cnM3MmYwMmYxZjE2ZTQxNGE5MDQ1ZjNkYjY5NGQxMzAy">Marakova motioned, and they entered the tunnel. It wasn’t high enough to stand so Polina had to awkwardly half-crouch. Marakova shut the gate behind them, and they progressed in darkness for a few minutes before Marakova spoke in a whisper.</p>
<p class="cnNkODljZDQzZDQ3MzQ5ZmNhOTg0Yzk3M2I2NzkyNmVm">“These are the old sewers that used to serve this district before they tore it down to build the docks. Now they’re used for the flood waters in storm season.”</p>
<p class="cnNiZTg1OWRiYmZmNjRiNjhiYTA5ZmE0NTVlNWNlMGM1">“What happened!?”</p>
<p class="cnMwZjUzZjMzZDQxODQ4ZjNhNzNiN2I0NTQxN2M5ODQ2">“Something in our cover gave us away. A traitor. Someone bribed. A mistake. It could have been anything. It happens.”</p>
<p class="cnNjOWI2NWQxMzRkYTRjNTVhODYzMmYyNDcxNmI3Mjkz">“Is everyone…” Polina felt her voice break slightly. She wasn’t tremendously close to the team, but she had started playing cards with them and they had shared drinks more than once.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTZiNDVlNzc3MzRjMDc5YzM4MWQ5MjE4OGExMjI4">“Dead? Yes, and if they aren’t, they’ll be trying to find a way to become dead. You don’t want to find yourself under interrogation by demons. Do you have your capsule?”</p>
<p class="cnMzNzgyODUyZGMyNDRhNmY4MzRhOWY0MDM4ZGIzNDMx">“Uh… no, it must have fallen out of my pocket while climbing the rope.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYWE5MTY2YTdmMTQwMmM4NjI2MDJiMGVmYWJiMDBi">“Take this, put it under your tongue.” Polina felt something pressed into her hand. It was a familiar wax capsule. She placed it under her tongue. “Quiet now,” Marakova ordered, and soon, the only sound that could be heard was the shuffling of their feet and her own frantic breathing.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDc2MzI1NWEzMjQ1ZTJhMzFhYTg2MWFlMGMwZWVi">Time passed and suddenly the darkness grew lighter and Polina could make out details of the wall and ground. As the figure of Marakova in front of her became ever clearer the sound of wind could be heard. They arrived at another gate. Marakova didn’t have a key for this one, so she pulled the iron bars apart with her bare hands.</p>
<p class="cnM0NmYyY2Q5NTMwNDRlOWQ4M2M1ZjY3MDIzYzgzOGEw">Red aura really was something.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTIyYmMyMDFiNjQ3ODI4Y2RlZTgxZGYyYjdmYWIz">“Where are we?” Polina whispered, peering out over the edge and swallowing at the sheer drop of a hundred meters or more. The wind whistled and her hair fluttered wildly.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjFlYzU4YjhiMDRlYmE4NDFiOGIzY2QxYWJmZWQ3">“On the outside of the plateau. We’ll have to climb up,” Marakova said while twisting her neck to look upwards. “It’s on a slight incline, so that helps. I’ll make the hand and footholds for you, alright? Be careful when you look up; stones and dirt will fall into your eyes.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MTYzZDUxM2M3YjQyZDU4YzUwOWRiMGJkYzFhMjcw">Before Polina could protest, Marakova began climbing. Polina followed, needing to take more than a few seconds to find the courage to leave the safety of the tunnel. The wind was far stronger than she expected, forcing her to press her body tight against the wall lest it rip her off. She was sure she might have shed more than a few tears, but the wind snatched them away as soon as they could form.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjg2OWU3YmE0ODRlYzBiOThkYzc0NGU5YzQzYTE0">Hand by hand, foot by foot, handhold by holdhold. Polina followed Marakova as she whispered prayers to the Lord. Someone up there must have been looking out for her because eventually they reached the top. Marakova peeked over before quickly pulling herself up and then helping Polina up. They were on a small street, and while Polina could see movement at the ends, it seemed no one saw them climb up.</p>
<p class="cnNiMzZjNTE3OTcyNjQ4YjhhZTA3MjYyYjdlNzhmNzMy">She wanted desperately to rest but Marakova dragged her into a side alley. They ran for a few minutes until Polina’s lungs were screaming at her.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2MwYjg1ZTk1MjQ4M2Q4ZDAwYmE3MTM4NWM4OWFm">“Ma’am…” Polina gasped, stopping against a wall. “Please… a moment.” Marakova stopped and for the first time Polina caught a glimpse of sympathy in her eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNlZGYyMWExYTZkZTRiMjViYTkzZGYyYzgzZTQ3Nzkx">“I forgot how weak people are without aura,” Marakova said. “Take a moment, Senior Volkova.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOGFmNzdhMjU4YjQ5NGM5OTRiMDk1YmQxNTFjNWIw">“Ah… Thank you…”</p>
<p class="cnNmZDE1Mjk5NzM0NjRkYzdhYTQwNWVkMzcwNmIwZjlm">After a minute of rest, Polina felt her heart rate return to normal. They continued through the side streets at a brisk walk.</p>
<p class="cnM3M2ZlYTE3OWY1NjRmNzhhMGE1YzFmZDk0MTVmNDdm">“Twenty-Four, Long-Hall Lane,” Marakova suddenly said.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjgyZDcxMWJiNzQzZDA5OWViYjIxYjA3Y2IxMzdi">“What?”</p>
<p class="cnNkMzMyNjVmODM3ZDQ3ODVhMzVkYjAxNjAzMmNkNWM3">“Twenty-Four, Long-Hall Lane,” Marakova repeated, “Say it back to me.”</p>
<p class="cnM5OGQ4OGE4M2E3MjQzMGM5NGUxOTAzZThmMGFkMGE5">“Twenty-Four, Long-Hall Lane,” Polina said.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTNlZGM3NWFkYzQyNzRhM2Y0YzVjNmJlZDFmNmMx">“It’s a safe house,” Marakova explained, “In the eastern human district. The key is hidden under the kami statue by the stairs leading up to the entrance.” Marakova turned and stared at Polina. “If we’re ever separated, go there and wait. Do you understand?”</p>
<p class="cnNlM2M4ODkzMzUwYzRlZTJiMjY1MjUzZWE3ODE4MmRh">“Y-yes,” Polina answered, “Why are you helping me so much? Wouldn’t it be more efficient if you were by yourself?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YWFkYTc3MDcwYzQyOTlhNzQ4NTJhMDRhZGE1ODZl">“Silly girl.” Marakova snorted. “Your blessing is more valuable than I am. The only thing worse than you dying is you surviving <em>and </em>being caught. You must <em>never</em> be caught. Understand?”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODU4NmNkNWU1MDRkYTA5ZTRmN2IzN2I3ZjA1Mzg4">“Yes, Team Leader,” Polina swallowed nervously.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzlmNmQzZDNlMTQ5ZDVhZjUxZDdiOGFkNzFkYmYx">For half an hour, they moved through the city. Marakova didn’t tell her where they were heading, and Polina didn’t ask. Just as they were about to exit a side street onto one of the busier shopping streets, Marakova froze before snapping her body around.</p>
<p class="cnMyOWJmZDE5MGM4ZDRlOWJiMzQ3NTIwYTBkZTU4MTUx">“We’re being followed,” she whispered, pointing the revolver down the dark alleyway. “Someone with skill…” Marakova handed Polina the revolver and took a few steps. “Guns are no use here,” she whispered. “Run.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNTNiZDJkZDIzYTQzMjQ5NDk4MzE5YjcwODY5NTY5">“Wha-” Polina began but was cut off as a man in a robe appeared before her, swinging down a sword to cut her head off. Marakova intercepted the blade with an arm which had taken on an orange glow.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWQxZjc4ZWUxMTRlM2E5NzQyMzk4MTk5MmI4NDI5">“Run!” Marakova yelled.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWQ4ODljOTk1MTQwOTI5Y2MwN2JiMjViMDU5OTFm">Polina didn’t need to be told a third time. She turned and sprinted out of the alley onto the main street, slamming straight into a demon carrying some shopping.</p>
<p class="cnMyY2JhZDNkZGU2NDQ3YmFiM2Q5ZDNlMzVjMjg5NmUw">“Oi!” The demon yelled, but Polina ignored him and ran down the busy street, weaving and dodging between stalls and their shoppers. She ran and ran, not knowing if her head was going to be cut off at any moment. When her lungs were about to explode, she turned into a quiet side alley and threw up onto the floor.</p>
<p class="cnMyMThmMjIzODVlZTQwMjhiZTA5N2E4OGVhOTY5Yzhh">“Ah… ah… ah…” Tears formed and she wiped them away. Polina spent a few minutes collecting her breath and her emotions. Was Marakova okay? Polina didn’t know, but she had to keep moving. She tucked the revolver in her belt. Thankfully, the wax capsule was still secure under her tongue, having survived the chaotic events.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzRmZWM5NjQ3MjQ4NzQ4MDRiMzg4ZTYwOTJmOWVm">Polina gathered herself and kept heading east. She figured she would find the eastern human district and go from there. As she walked, she wiped the worst dirt and grime from her clothes that had built up through the sewers.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjJlNTU0NzMzNTRiNzg4YmE0ZTgyYjJhNjgxNDkx">She found a pathway to an elevated part of the city where a pagoda was located. As she walked upwards more of the city could be seen below. She was at the south-eastern edge of Kenhoro, and spread out below and in front of her…</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTAzZTlkNWM2YzQxYTFhODE1OTVhZTcwOWVhZDc5">Was the eastern docks.</p>
<p class="cnM5Zjg4NTQ3MWVkYTRiZTg5NTAyZmNlODgxOWRmMDkw">Where a single ship sat docked.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTQ0M2RiOTBkZDRhZGNiY2MzN2RiZjY0ODc0OGEw">A ship taking on passengers and their luggage.</p>
<p class="cnM2OTc2ZmY0MzIzYzRlNjFhMWM2YTIyYTJlNGRiNTBh">A cutter, with the name<em> Sakamoto</em> in white lettering down the side.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDBmMjI2ZDgyNDRjNGM4YjMyZTBlNTU2YjJhYWFk">This was the ship Serena Halen was taking south to Shimashina. Polina swallowed. What should she do? What did her training tell her? The Kenhoro network was compromised. She had the location of a safe house, but Marakova also knew that location. She should assume that Marakova was captured and the location would be discovered.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmVhYWNhNjYzODQxYTliZGQ1NzIyNWNkZjYxMDFk">This meant… she needed to leave Kenhoro. She would need to hide in the human district until storm season was over and then find a way back to the Federation. Or… she could board <em>The Sakamoto</em> right now. Not only would she be leaving Kenhoro, but she would also be able to achieve her ultimate goal.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDRjYTkyZGRiYzQ5N2FhMDg5Mzk4YmE1ZmYzZmM0">Was this the best choice? Or was her decision-making clouded by her desire for vengeance? Polina shook her head. In the end, it didn’t matter. She would keep moving on. Until the end.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjlhMjVjNDRjZDQ4YjU5MTBmMGM4ZWQwZWI3Yjkw">With her mind made up, Polina followed the path down to the eastern docks, where she saw a group of travellers getting their tickets stamped before heading through a gate. It was a gate she could climb if it wasn’t in direct line of sight of the employee sitting in the windowed office.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjY1YmViNzkzMzRhNzE5OWQyOGQzMWJjOTRjOTAz">She chewed her lips momentarily, thinking about how she could get past. Then she saw that the building the employee was in was lit by aetherlights.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzNjYjc3NzkzMTQzZWJiZTQ4MjE1Y2Q3ZDlkYTZk">That would work.</p>
<p class="cnM0NDk5MTMxODgzOTQ2YWNhOTI5NWJiN2MxOTNiMzFm">Polina waited until there was no one else around and activated her blessing. The world was drained of all colour, and she felt her energy draining. In her vision, she could see the moon crystals in the building’s aetherlights glowing through the walls. She focused on one behind the employee, ignoring how queasy it made her. The crystal was stable but Polina gave it a nudge, telling it to become <em>unstable</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZWI4ZjliNTNiNDRlNDA4MTA5NDQxN2QyZjMzNTI1">The aetherlight exploded.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2VhNDcwYjBmZDQzN2VhOGRiMGEwZGQyY2I1MjQ2">“Fuck!” The employee jumped, spinning around.</p>
<p class="cnM5MWZhODA0MTk3ODQxYzNiZWI5YjFiMjg2YjkzZWRl">Polina moved. She walked as fast as she could while keeping her feet quiet. Towards the gate she went. She focused again, and another aetherlight on the ceiling of the building exploded. She heard the employee curse, but he didn’t turn around. She reached the gate. Focusing once more, she picked a lamp in the room and made that <em>unstable</em>. As the final explosion continued, she scrambled up and over the gate and quickly turned a corner.</p>
<p class="cnMyNWJjYTQwNWQxNDQyMzU4NDQ1YzY5MDFkYzA4MjVh">Using her ability three times so quickly made her feel faint, and she had to rest against a wall for a moment. Gritting her teeth, she pushed herself off. She just needed to get on the ship. But how? Polina looked around and saw a small windowed room. Opening the door, she found herself in the employee cloakroom. She found a jacket that looked like someone’s spare uniform and put it on. Grabbing a workhat and fixing it on her head, Polina exited the room.</p>
<p class="cnM0MmRmMjJjN2Q1MTQ1ZmM4NmIyMzM1MWM0YzBmNGVi">She approached <em>The Sakamoto</em> as a family was boarding, struggling to move all their luggage aboard. They were arguing in frustrated tones, clearly the stress of last-minute travel testing their nerves.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjY5ODU1ZDdkNTQ2NTFhYzJkMGIxOTczODg0YmI4">“Need any help?” she asked, trying not to let her Federation accent come through. Not waiting for a reply, she picked up a piece of luggage. “What room?” she asked. After receiving an answer, she took a deep breath and walked up the gangplank into the ship. Thankfully, the conductor was distracted and only glanced at her. She wasn't sure whether he assumed she was a part of the family or a dock employee.</p>
<p class="cnMxOWM0YzU3ZDI5MzQxNTVhNTJhYTU1ZDIxZDBhZjgz">Walking through the ship, Polina followed the signs to the room. She kept her head down and her eyes low. Her heart was racing. Every time she turned a corner, she jumped in anticipation of bumping into Serena Halen or Amelia Thornheart. What would she do if she saw them? If they saw her? She didn’t know.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWNmMDM0OWZjNzQxY2ZiN2E0ZDQ5NDg1NGQ5ZjM3">She wasn’t ready, yet.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDhiMDExYzgyNzQ4YjA4MDE3OWM3MDgzNWZkZDI4">Arriving at the room she dumped the luggage inside. It was a fancy first-class room, but not a place she could hide in. As the family arrived and started bickering with each other Polina took her leave. She needed to find somewhere she could hide. Somewhere where she could find a lot of moon crystal.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDFhM2IyMmRlOTRiOGViMDhiYzU3NmI5MjRhMDJl">Steeling her nerves, Polina walked through the ship.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDExNGI5ZjQ1YjQ5MzQ5YWFkNGM1OWM2OTAzOWZh">Towards the engines.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDI1OGMzYTRjNjQ3MjI4MTAyMDZkODllOGM0ZWIy"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMjIzOGMzYWJmMDQyNDliZTBhMjRiNDJkNjYwNDA2"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM5Njk1YjkzNTY3MjQxNWZhYTY3YTgxMjRhMjZmYTEw">“All this happened so fast,” Amelia said, swinging her legs. There wasn’t even enough room to cuddle on the small bed so Serena laid on it while Amelia sat on the table. “What about Aiden? Oh! We didn’t get to say goodbye to Grandpa Gu or Lord Yulan!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNzNiZmRlODY1NDQ3NWY4YzAzZmY0ODBmNDUwZTJm">“Aiden will have been updated and he’ll let the grandmaster know something came up,” Serena said, yawning lightly. “Mister Weng will notify Yulan if he comes knocking at the inn. What time is it?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZDE0MmMzNDQ3MTQyZGY5YjgxMTZiYzQ5ODdiMWUz">Amelia glanced at the wall clock ticking softly. “Dinner time! Wow, it’s already been so long! How far do you think we’ve travelled?” The pair had kept to themselves since <em>The Sakamoto</em> had set off. At one point, Amelia had even retired to her own room and napped. The sounds of the engine had lulled her to sleep.</p>
<p class="cnNiNTUzMmZmODgyMzQxYjA5OGU4NTY5Nzk0YTIzZjc0">“Eight hours… a cutter like this will travel at fifty knots so… a little over seven hundred klicks,” Serena said while placing a hand on her stomach. “I’m hungry. Are you hungry?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNjI2NGZhNWVhYTRhNWRiMTJjYjVkMmI0YjM5MjNh">“Yeah!”</p>
<p class="cnM1ODFjYzhlYzY5OTRhMDliOTRkZDczZGNmYzNjMGY2">“Let’s see what passes for food around here… come on.” They both left their room and made their way to the dining room. It was a long, thin room with small tables and cubicles to the sides. Waiters moved trollies of food down the centre and at the far side the kitchens could be seen where a handful of chefs worked as they chopped vegetables and sizzled meat.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjE5MDQyOWJmMDRkNjE5MTU1YWU3MmE1ZDYzMjIz">“Do you have a reserved table?” A passing employee asked.</p>
<p class="cnM4ODgwNTRmNjE1OTQyZDM4OTkxYWQ4MWFhYzkwNmZk">“No,” Serena said.</p>
<p class="cnM0NDM5MzY1Mzc4MTQ4OGY4ZDdkNzlkOWI2M2Y1NmY2">“Sit anywhere where there isn’t a reserved sign. Ring the bell when you’re ready to order! Menus are over there!” The employee pointed and then rushed off to collect more plates from the kitchen.</p>
<p class="cnMyMWM5YTVlZjMwMjRhODRhN2NhYzAzMTlmYzAwYzlk">Amelia bounced over and picked two menus then followed Serena to a table. As they sat down, Amelia was delighted to find that she could read the majority of the dishes. The lessons from Tomes were really paying off! Amelia eventually settled on her choice but when she looked up at Serena she found her girlfriend was looking down the dining room with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTk3OTgwODk0NzQwOTFhNzE0YzJkZTUzNjQwZjI3">“What’s up?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjNjMzk2YTc4MjQzYzdiN2ZiYzYzNmU3NDVhNDEx">“Listen to what those employees are saying.” Serena nodded in the distance and Amelia focused on her hearing. Two uniformed employees were having a whispered discussion. Amelia’s high perception easily captured the contents.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzM2NDhlYjk3ZjQ3ZThiOGM3YWU1YzZhYzgzN2Y0">“A <em>stowaway!?”</em> Amelia whispered, “Someone snuck onboard?”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTMwN2EyZjM4NTRjNmVhNzNiYjg4MjY0NjA3NTU0">“In the engine room… they’ve barricaded the door…” Serena mumbled, before sighing and standing up. “I’ll investigate this. Stowaways are not uncommon but considering the situation I’m going to double-check. You never know…”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTRiMzE3YWY4YTQzZDFiN2U4NjE3YTVmZDc5ZDc4">“Want me to come with you?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTY0MTdlZDEyZTQyZTQ5NTdmZTZmNWJhNjY0MzBk">“No need. I’ll just have whatever you’re having. I won’t be long.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ODMwZWY2MTIzMTQ3ODY4MzI3NzgwMmY5ODU2YzI4">“Okay!” Amelia chirped.</p>
<p class="cnNlZmYwMDVlMTI2NjQ5NWE4ZDYwYjNhN2RjZTczODQ0">Serena left and informed the employees who she was. After a moment of deliberation, they lead her back down the room, past Amelia and through the doors. Amelia ordered her food and relaxed, humming to herself. She didn’t want to be nosey, but she couldn’t help but eavesdrop on the surrounding conversations. Everyone was travelling for different reasons. Some were trying to return for a family birthday, others for a business meeting. Some were travelling for leisure, while others were catching a connecting ship to go further afield.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjhkMDc0NGZlODQ4MDA4NmRlMmYwMWExNDlmMmJl">As Amelia listened the hairs on her neck rose as <em>something</em> rippled through the aetherfield. Her instincts screamed at her and she had just enough time to throw up a ward around her.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmNmMDI2N2MwZjRjZmFiYTU4ZmM1NzIwNzdkNTUx">And then the ship exploded.</p>
<p class="cnNlOGE2MWUxZTM4YTRmYzU4OTY1MjQyYzNjOGFhZWI1">She had just enough time to see bodies and wood fly against her ward before being lifted off her seat as the room twisted and tumbled wildly. She was flipped in the air and was only just able to grab onto a wooden pillar. Looking at her feet she could see an enormous hole in the ship where the kitchen was and beyond it the darkening night sky.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWYwMzdlZDhjODQzN2FhY2ZiNTU3M2IwMzY4OWUw">Chairs, tables, food, and cutlery bounced around the room, along with two dozen bodies, some of which were screaming and the others quiet.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDNjODJmMzMzZDQyNmNiZjkyZjA0ZTRlY2M2MGI3">Amelia gritted her teeth and boiled her aether. She threw out a healing spell, covering what she hoped was the entire ship. What else could she do? Where was Serena? She needed to find her.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjliMjgxODNiNTQxYzQ5MWQ3MTZhMzUzZjRmNzBm">“Serena!” she yelled out as the wind screamed outside.</p>
<p class="cnMzNGZiZjJiMDliNzQ0OGI4OTc2NDEzZDc3ZGIwMWUw">“Serena!” she scrunched her eyes shut as tears formed.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjI5NzU0NWRmNjRkYjQ4YzVmNzI4NmFiOGYwZmU1">“Serena!” she was scared. It didn’t matter how powerful she was. She was scared!</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDg0ZjBiOTViYzQzY2E5NDg3MmRiODQyNTg1M2Q2">“Sere-” A familiar hand grabbed onto her. It was Serena.</p>
<p class="cnM1MGVkNWU3OTkwYzQxYTM4ODA1NjhlOTI0ZjNiYzJi">“Serena…” she couldn’t help but blubber as her emotions got the best of her.</p>
<p class="cnNhMWVkMTBhNDAzNzQzMmU4ZGU0Y2E1YTU2MWIwMTli">“It’s okay!” Serena yelled over the wind. “The engine's blown! We need to get outside! So we can see!” Amelia nodded. Serena looked at the hole where the kitchen was. “There must have been a bomb in the kitchen as well! It’s an assassination! Come on!”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmZkNzU4YTY4YzQ3MmM5ZGEyMjUwNDUxN2E1MzVm">Together, they climbed <em>up</em> the dining room as the ship was now in a nose dive. They weren’t fussy about handholds, using their extreme strength to simply grip <em>into</em> the wood as they pulled themselves towards the hole. As they reached their goal, Amelia threw out another ship-wide healing spell. Who knew how many people were getting hurt by things flying around?</p>
<p class="cnNlYWEyYjhkMDhlZTRiODI5MWRhMjc3NmI4MTYzZTVm">They climbed out of the ship and if it wasn’t for her strength the wind would have pulled her off. Looking down, she could see smoke billowing from holes all through the ship's structure. And beyond that… was the ground. The dark green expanse of the endless forest was approaching faster and faster as they approached terminal velocity.</p>
<p class="cnNiOTQ1NWY4NTE3ZTRkMjg4M2EzY2Y5NmQ1NzBmNGQ2">“What do we do!?” Amelia tried to think how to save everyone on board. She could throw out a healing spell just as they collided but would that help? In airplane disasters, bodies <em>disintegrated</em>. She wasn’t confident she could time it right, and even if she did, could she heal somebody if they were in pieces?</p>
<p class="cnNjZDc2Y2ZiYmRmZTQxYzNhODM3MmY4MDMwZTY0NWFh">Luckily, Serena seemed to have a plan.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDJhZTcwOTIxZjRiOWJhZjg0M2YyNjQ2NzU3MzRi">“Can you Speak!?” Serena yelled. “I can’t! I’ll destroy the ship and blow us away! But you can!”</p>
<p class="cnNkMGQwYmM2YjY4MzQzMDJiNGRjYjM5YjI4NTQ4NTVl">“Okay!” Amelia yelled back, folding the aether into <em>Aseco </em>and then ejecting the remaining aether so Speaking wouldn’t cause a power release. “<strong>Aseco,</strong>” she Spoke and she felt herself become divine as the godly aether rushed into her body. She glowed an incandescent golden, so bright anyone a hundred klicks around would see.</p>
<p class="cnMyODU4MzJhZjI2YzQwYWU5NGEyOWY4ODNkMTYyYmM3">“Good!” Serena yelled. “Flare your aether as hard as you can! Against the lumina! Hold the ship up!”</p>
<p class="cnM4YWM0Y2MzNzkyYTRhNTc5MWM1Njc3MGNjYjI5OGFj">Amelia gritted her teeth and did as instructed. Her connection to the aetherfield was extremely strong and by flaring her aether she could levitate against the vast lumina far below. She pressed her aether as far as the First Word allowed her and for a moment she felt the ship slow as the force she produced counteracted against the thousands and thousands of tonnes falling towards the ground.</p>
<p class="cnMxZjA4N2Q4MjE0NDQ4N2Q5YjE5M2EzY2ZmOTJmZjZm">But it wasn’t enough. She could slightly slow the doomed ship, but she couldn’t do enough to prevent the crash from being devastatingly fatal to everyone inside. The method of generating force from the lumina-aether reaction wasn’t efficient.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTg0M2QxNDA1ZTQ2ZmY5MmNhYWQ3MDUxY2MwYWY4">The First Word wasn’t enough.</p>
<p class="cnNhMGQwNzRjY2I4MDQxY2Y4MjViMTg0NTFlMzhhNjc4">“I need to Speak more!” She yelled, looking at Serena. “The First Word isn’t powerful enough!” As her words reached Serena, her girlfriend’s eyes widened as she registered Amelia’s intentions. A sombre moment passed while they looked at each other with complex emotions.</p>
<p class="cnNmMGRlZTkyMzM1YTQwZWY5YTg3MzIxMjAzNmFlNmU1">Serena gave the smallest of nods. “Do it!”</p>
<p class="cnM1Mzg2NWEzZjhkMjQzYmU4OGI4NTU5ZThhM2NjYjM0">“Promise me!” Amelia called, “Promise me you won’t change how you see me! No matter what I become!”</p>
<p class="cnMyMTc3YjczNTVmNTQ2ZTg4ODI2ODhhY2Y4NTMxZThj">“... I promise!”</p>
<p class="cnNkNmE3MDdhZWYxZDQzYWM5OTBmZDRlOGQyYjAxZmFm">“Okay!” Amelia closed her eyes, focusing inwards, ignoring the screaming wind and the ground rushing to meet them. She focused only on the divine aether inside her as she moulded the aether of <em>Aseco</em> into the advanced Word. It was the first time she had done this for real, but her instincts didn’t let her down and in a few moments it was ready.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTMyMjAyOTQwNjQ5NTJiNzVhNTU5NGJlYzdmODMz">Amelia opened her eyes and Spoke the Second Word of the branch of divinity.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDIwOTMwOWU3NTRlZWFhYzJlMDBhNjc3YzZlYTFl"><strong>“ASCLEPIUS!</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTEyMjQ3ZmI3YTQwOWE5NzkwMWNiZTAxYzQ5YjAy">The world slowed to a crawl as it took on a sepia tone. All sound was muffled apart from the ethereal <em>thud</em> that erupted from the divine aether in Amelia's body, rippling through the aetherfield and the mists. The noise snaked its way through the planes of reality as it sought its owner.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTYyMDgyMDNmZDRiZGU4MTNjMzk2YzU2ZTQyMzVh">It was a knock on the door, so to speak.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjMyMWIyNzY3MzRlOWRiY2QyMzk1ZWM5ODQxMjAy">After a moment that felt like a dozen seconds to Amelia, but was only microseconds in real-time, an answer came back.</p>
<p class="cnNjZTRmY2NmNzM1ZDQxOTU5NDQ3YmZkMWQxZjY2ODBi">“<strong>Oh, mighty and dreadful daemon lord, arrayed in human flesh. Dost thou seek to sully my nature? Dost thou desire my embodiment?”</strong></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDRkM2E0ZjMyNzRjODM4MjQ0YjQyYjE2MWI0N2I4">It took Amelia a moment to register the words being spoken in her mind. The experience of having <em>Asclepius</em> communicate with her directly was akin to being blasted by amounts of aether far denser than any attack she had witnessed in the world so far. No wonder the Second Word was such a momentous achievement here! The average Speaker would be risking their lives just making this initial step!</p>
<p class="cnNhNGFjNTcwMjEwMzRlZjdhMDNiOGIwNjgyMzU2NGUx">Well, the deity had asked her a question, and keeping him waiting would be impolite.</p>
<p class="cnM5OTliNmUyMTUzMTRjNmNhMmVhYmQ4YmQxODNhOWQ5">“Um… yes, please?” Amelia chirped.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTA3MjE1NDAwYzQ5YmQ4MzUyMWJmNjg3OGMxYjRl"> </p>

<p class="cnNjNGJjZTY3MDBmNjQ0YTg5ZWY4NmRjYjExZWJlNGZh">Faren gripped the ship's railing with white knuckles, forcing himself to take deep breaths as the upper-sky island came into view. Of all his friends and acquaintances, he didn’t know anyone who got more air sick than he did. He felt queasy travelling on a tiny ship like this, especially as the storm season winds meant he was constantly off balance.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDA3ODMzZDg3ODRiNDBhNzJiNTkyNzExMmRmNjI4">“Ready with the rope, Mister Faren!” yelled the captain, struggling to keep the ship’s wheel from spinning out of control. “Look! They’re waiting!” the captain gestured with his chin at the approaching island, and Faren squinted to see a pair of demons waving from a small jetty.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTU4YjFlMjBmNDQ0NjM4MGRkN2NhZDkxZjFkY2Ni">Faren braced himself as the ship came ever closer, holding the hefty rope in one hand while trying to keep himself steady with the other. The winds battered the ship, tilting it this way and that. He groaned silently to himself. He’d been assured his career in sensors and communications would mean a dull but stable life in an office somewhere. Unfortunately, things hadn’t turned out so easy for Faren. Sure, he’d finally got the position in an office…</p>
<p class="cnNmNzZmZGVkM2ZlMDRmNmJhNzcwNTE2ZDMxMzQ0MGM4">One floating six thousand meters above the continent.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTQwNDAwMWQ2ODQ5ZTFhYWMzNTRmMDRkZWYzODk0">“Going to be a bit of a bump!” yelled the captain over the wind as the island rushed to meet them. They were probably breaking more than a few sky laws coming in to dock like this, but what could they do? If they didn’t dock now, who knew when they would be able to?</p>
<p class="cnMxNzBkZDA5MzRiZTQ0ZDJiYjE4MzAwZTBiYTQwOWJk">In the last few meters, the captain flipped a lever, and the ship spun so Faren’s side aligned with the jetty. “Throw it!” the captain shouted and Faren threw the rope with all his might at the two demons. They caught the rope and a moment later Faren was almost thrown off the ship as it collided with the jetty. The ship listed slightly before lifting up and over the structure.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzMzYzg1MWNkZjQ5N2JhNTcyMDljMjk0YTBhZDEz">“Easy, easy!” the captain fumbled with the wheel before locking it in place. A second jolt went through the ship and Faren bent over the side to see that the two men had firmly secured the rope around a metal post. “Good work, Mister Faren!” the captain called. “I’ll reduce the lift, jump down and help them pull us in!”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmRiZDg2YTEzODQxMWY4MTkyZjIwYTRlM2UwODdl">Credit to the captain, he was skilled at operating his station. Despite being battered by the winds, the ship slowly lowered in a controlled manner. Faren clambered off the side of the ship and dropped onto the jetty. He rushed over to take his place next to the other two, gripping the rope and trying to find somewhere to dig his heels.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDBhZjFiNjA5YjQyN2ViNjk0MGU4MjNhNTQyNjVh">“Heft!” called one of the demons, and Faren pulled with all his might.</p>
<p class="cnM5YmJmN2I3MDMzNTQ3ODg4ZDIyM2E0YTFiNWZkODk1">“Heft!” Faren pulled again.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTVlODY1ZmY3ZjRhYzliNGNmNTlmM2E5M2JlYzY3">“Heft!” The ship became level with the jetty.</p>
<p class="cnMwMWZjMmVmZTYxNjQzYzhhODU2ZWJmYWViYjA1NTlj">“Heft!” A final pull, and the slack in the rope was wrapped around the metal pole. A second rope was used to fasten the ship against another pole further along the jetty.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDMyZDQ1ZTMzNjRkZTRhYTQ1YWY1MGVmZDFmMjE0">“Get the supplies off first!” one of the demons shouted. “Quickly!” Faren nodded and with the captain and two others they began getting the cargo off the ship. They formed a line running crates back and forth into the small wooded area that was the island's key feature.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDcyNDY1ODRiNDRmNWU4MmZlNWZmMDVmZmFlYTYy">Once they were done, one of the demons turned to the captain and asked, "Do you want to wait until the winds die down?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZmUwOTc5NGRmNzRiNjRhYzcxNGViMDM5ODgwNWQx">“No! I’ll ride it back down!” replied the captain. “See me off!” he clambered back behind the ship’s wheel and gave the signal. The other two demons unwrapped the holding ropes and soon the ship was pulled by the winds away from the island.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWU1NWQ4MWJhYjQ1ODQ4MTg0MTdkNGQxYzEyNWE3">“Woohoo!” Faren heard the captain’s cheers and mad laughter as the ship sailed away, soon disappearing below the cloud layer.</p>
<p class="cnNhYjQ2ZGMxZjA0ZTRkMTdiOTFiYjU4YmFjZWE0ODJh">“Crazy bastard!” the demon exclaimed. “Can’t say I blame him! Who’d want to be stuck here for months!?” he gestured to Faren. “Come on! Help us get these inside!”</p>
<p class="cnM0M2MwZWExOTUzNjRhOGY5ZjQ4NGM0NWYxYjYzODQy">“Inside?” Faren asked. The island was small. There were perhaps two dozen trees. He couldn’t see any sign of a building or structure. His question was answered as his new colleagues opened a rusted door built into a raised mound. Peering in, Faren discovered there was a path that, judging by the way it curved, spiralled down into the island itself.</p>
<p class="cnMyNzlmYzAyYzBhMDQ3Zjc5OGVhZDBhN2MwMjZjZThj">Eager to get out of the wind and its constant howling he helped the others carry the cargo through the doors and down the spiralling path. Aetherlights lit his way and soon he arrived in a small room where someone was waiting for him.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTM0MjFmOWUyOTQ4NTRiZmQ4ZGRkZDgwNjU3NzQ3">“You’re the new sensors analyst?” The man puffed on a cigar, his three horns making him look a little like a trident. “Welcome.” He shook Faren’s hand. “I’m your boss for the foreseeable future. Call me Mangs.”</p>
<p class="cnNjZDA0YWRhZGJjOTRlMWVhOGFkYWE0NThiZTdiNzY2">“Uh, yes, Officer Mangs!” Faren recognised the name and gave a quick salute.</p>
<p class="cnNjZmI0NjVjNjdhYjQ1MWM4YWU3NGRmZmY1NzVhOTVi">“We don’t bother with that shit here,” Mangs said, waving a hand dismissively. “This isn’t a bridge of a ship. Don’t bother with titles, either. Save that for when the upper brass comes knocking.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZmY2ZDM4ZmQwYzRhNzdiYmUxMjViZTY1YjZiMWUy">“Ah, sure.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTk5MTMyMzNmYjQyMDU4YjYyODA5ZDdlMjMzZDQy">“This is Goren, our steam mechanic.” Mangs gestured to one of the demons. “And this is Ladis, our aethersmith, although we all call him by his family name, Longhall.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYWFjYzkzNzRkYTQ0YWM5OTY1YmUxNzlhZTIyMmM0">Goren and Longhall took turns shaking his hand. “You’re Faren, right?” Longhall asked with a grin. “It’s been quiet since Urlan left. Must have been a shaky ride to get up here.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDY2NzJiMjlhYzQzYzJhMmQ2N2NjOTQ5ODM2Y2Jl">“Sure was,” Faren said. “Thought the damn captain was going to flip the ship.”</p>
<p class="cnMyZWU0ZGYyN2U2MjQ2NTU5MTVkMmE0Y2M4ZWRhNjFi">“Any captain sailing in these winds has to be mad,” Goren said, shaking his head. “They’ve stopped civilian traffic now. We received the notification only a few minutes ago.”</p>
<p class="cnM0OTBlYWUwNjI5MjQ5NWRiM2E5ZjA2Nzk3YTZkMjZm">“No one is leaving the island for a while,” Mangs said, banging on a large metal door. He turned to Faren as someone on the other side moved a series of heavy bolts. “Try not to piss anyone off. Not a lot of space around here. Best we all be friends.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNTNhY2ZiOWU5ZTRhZTBhNzY0YjI5ZDc5M2IwYzdj">Before Faren could communicate his agreement, the heavy iron door was thrown open, and he caught sight of a flash of red. That flash of red belonged to a crimson-haired woman who darted past him and, using her bare hands, practically ripped one of the crates apart. The subtle red glow of the woman’s skin clarified Faren’s thoughts.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2FiMjVjYTUyZTRmMTE4OWZjYTUyNWM2YzdhZGVl">An aura user. From the north, if the red hair was any indication.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTcyNTU0MGM3MjRmNzA4YmNhMzY3NTdiMzYxNTI5">“Gimme!” The woman cheerfully announced as she filtered through the crate.</p>
<p class="cnNlNGY4OGE4MTI3ZTQ4ZTg4MWU5Mjk5NmU0MDQ3ZDFm">“Seven hells…” Goren mumbled. Longhall laughed and Mangs rolled his eyes before disappearing through the now-open door.</p>
<p class="cnMyZGQ2MWVmNWVjZTRiMzM5YmYwZGMzZjFjMTRhMTAy">“Ah, my beloved! My child!” The woman held up a package of rations in the air before clutching it tightly to her chest. Faren saw the black lettering on the package: <em>COFFEE</em>. Wasn’t military coffee the worst? The woman recovered and turned to face Faren with a quizzical expression.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDYyZGE1NGVjNjQwYzc5MjdkYTBiNDUxODI4NzQ1">“Oh? Finally, a handsome face around here.” The woman put her hand out and Faren shook it while introducing himself. “I’m Finella! A fellow analyst! So, you’ll be taking Urlen’s shift then? Rabbie’s sleeping, but I can kick him awake if you want to meet him.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYjE3Y2MwYjZiODQ1NjI4NDA0MDU2ZGI3MmM1ODUz">“Uh, no. That’s okay,” Faren said. He was a little taken back by the liveliness of the woman. “What made you become an analyst? You’re a warrior, right?” A demon who could manifest even the first aura would have an easy pathway to squad commander or even higher.</p>
<p class="cnM2YmY3OGYzMjZiYTQxODhhMTEyOGI0MTYxYzljZWU5">“Ha!” Finella put her hands on her hip and threw her hair back dramatically. “Damn right, I am! I used to be <em>Officer Bright</em>. Got me a fancy position on a light-cruiser. Only it turned out…” A forlorn expression appeared on Finella’s face. “It was not to be…”</p>
<p class="cnM3OGI5MDMwZTY0MDQyM2M5YmI1MmEzMmU4MDczNjZh">“What she means to say is she got in a fight with her captain.” Longhall said with a smile on his face. “Who was someone important. A Speaker. Their father was…”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTVjMTNmN2Q2ZjQ0ZTBiZDVhNzJjOTFkYzBmZDQw">“A highlord,” Finella groaned. “She was so uptight all the time. Thought if I pushed her buttons a little she would open up. Instead, things escalated…” Finella rubbed the back of her head. “Gave her a little tap and now I’m here!”</p>
<p class="cnMyM2MyYTMyM2I0MzRkNDNiNWUxNzg1ZWM1OWM0Y2Ey">Faren swallowed. “You struck your superior officer? Why didn’t they hang you?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NzNjYmU3ZTE5ZjQxZWNiYTJiYTVjMzQ3ZTFlOGNj">“‘Cause while she was beating me black and blue, I made a breakthrough and hit orange! Captain said hanging someone of my talent would be a waste so instead they demoted me and put me here on this island!” Finella leaned in and whispered, “I’m supposed to be training rigorously. If anyone asks, tell them I’m doing that, alright?” She gave Faren a wink and bounced out of the room.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTQxMzJhM2ExZTQ5MGJhMDYxNzgxOTljN2U2NGIz">Faren looked after her for a moment before turning back to Longhall and Goren. “Interesting colleagues,” he said with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTJhMTAzMDI2ZDRhOGRhODc2MTU2ZjIzM2E1NWU4">“You get used to her,” Longhall said, shrugging. “Come on, let’s get you settled in.” Faren was led through the door, and as he took in the room beyond he couldn’t help but exclaim in awe. “Biggest one you’ve seen?” Longhall asked.</p>
<p class="cnM1NmZhNmZhNmUwNDRlZThiY2U5ZGEzYjNlYjcxMzA4">“Yes. This must be bigger than one on a battleship.” Faren said, leaning over the walkway and looking down at the enormous aetherscope. Its bulbous silvery structure made it appear stationary but he knew enough to know about the heavy and complex moving parts inside. “What’s the diameter?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMzAzMTUzZWMzNzQ5NDQ5OGRjY2UzYjE2NjA1MTBl">“Sixteen meters,” answered Longhall, smiling as he saw Faren’s reaction. “We can detect a lift engine throughout most of the Sabanis Channel and as far south as Shimashina. Anything bigger than a fishing vessel disturbs the aetherfield and we hear it.” Longhall crossed his arms, looking proud. “And this baby runs <em>quiet</em>. Thanks to my maintenance.”</p><span class="cjVlMmU0YjgwYWI5ZjRlN2Y4NmQyYThiYmJlYzNiZDYx"><br/>This content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkNTM0OTg1NDUyMzRjOGQ5OGJhOGY5OGE1ZGFmNDZl">“How much power does it draw?” Faren asked. An aetherscope of this size would require significant amounts of both crystal and steam to function - especially if it operated day and night.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzdhZmU1ZTIzMDQyZWE4ZDJiODdkZTNhNmM5OWYz">“The engine's down that path there,” Goren said, pointing at an opening in the wall down below. “It’s a propulsion engine ripped from a scrapped battleship. It’s loud, but reliable. There’s a second failsafe engine, but we haven’t had to use it yet. Steam runs through the red pipes so don’t touch them unless you want your skin burned off.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNTY1OTk1MWU3YTRhNjBiZDU4MmZlMDMyODMzMGM5">“Down there is our living quarters. Try and be quiet if others are sleeping,” Longhall added, pointing down to where the walkway became a set of stairs spiralling down to the floor below.</p>
<p class="cnMzY2JiMDU5ZDllODQyNTc5NDFlNThmN2E0MGI3ZWI3">They slowly circled the gigantic aetherscope towards a communal area where Mangs and Finella were drinking coffee. “To build this all underground…” Faren muttered. “Wait, doesn’t the crystal content in the earth interfere with the signals?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NzUzYTI2NWQ2YjQ5NTNiZTYxMDQ2ZjhiMWFjMGUx">“There are none,” Longhall explained. “The entire island is artificial.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNWY1ZTFmMzU2OTRlZmZhZTc2YTNkYmQyNmRiMTQ1">“The <em>entire</em> island?” Faren’s mouth fell open.</p>
<p class="cnNlZGI2ZTIzMDQzNDRmMjE5ZjUyZWExYWM3MmM0MjU5">“That’s right. The earth was purified. See the metal slabs making up the floor below? They run through the island. It’s a ferro-crystal alloy. Generates lift against a matching set far below on the mountain range. Keeps us stable against the storms as well. Aetherlocking they call it. Not practical for a ship, but for something stationary? Perfect.”</p>
<p class="cnM2Mjk3YjA1ZDZlNjQ4Nzc4YjFkNjI0NzExOGFmOGM4">“Crazy, ain’t it?” Finella said, blowing on her cup of coffee. “All this used to be ore and raw crystal sitting around doing nothing. Then we’ve harvested it and somehow made it into things that can detect other things.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjZmZTE1NmNjZTQ0NDM4YTMyZTZmYTQxNWUxNTEy">“You hungry?” Mangs asked and Faren shook his head. “Well, have some coffee at least, before <em>this one</em> drinks all our rations.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZDk5MDdkZDZkYTQyMGNhNDJkZmZiNWE3YTA0ZWU0">“Hey!” Finella protested.</p>
<p class="cnNjYWUxZTA4MGJiZDQwMzlhOWYwOWE4MDc3YmM3N2Fi">Faren smiled and poured himself a cup of coffee. He’d been frustrated when he found out his assignment up here, even complaining to his superiors. Now, having met everyone, it didn’t seem too bad. Maybe a bit cramped, but he was sure he could manage the six-month shift.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjllNzM2MjMxNDQ3YWQ4MDM5ZjU2MWE2OWEwOWRh">The group of them sat and chatted for a while. Faren explained how he used to manage land-based wired communications for the rear-line before cross-training into sensor work. He shared his goal of eventually becoming a sensor officer on a bridge and was delighted to hear Mangs say if he didn’t fuck up he’d get a glowing referral at the end.</p>
<p class="cnMxMGMxYmZlZjU0ODQyMjdhMjYwYjFjMTg5YTdhODNh">“Let’s show you the work station then!” Finella piped up after she finished her cup. Goren and Longhall had work to do, so only Mangs joined them. Finella led them into a neighbouring room filled with desks, tables, and familiar equipment.</p>
<p class="cnNjMmUwYWM1ZmE0YzQ1YjhhZWU0NTlmZTU2MDEyMDFj">“Here’s the listening station! We have headphones to listen in on the aetherfield,” Finella lifted up a pair of wired headphones. “It’ll automatically start recording a paper trail if there’s a peak or lull, but if you want to do it manually, then just flip this lever.” Finella flicked a lever and a metal arm began scratching black ink on a continuously moving piece of paper.</p>
<p class="cnM1NTJhNjBkNTAyNjQ1NjBhNjg1ZjcwN2Q0ZmY4ZGY3">Finella flipped the switch back and pointed out a row of instruments along the wall. “Magnitude, frequency and pitch of incoming signals are displayed there. Log books are here. At the moment, we’re focused on traffic in the Sabanis Channel but log any ship you detect that isn’t also broadcasting its identification. And this…” Finella spun around to a large flat metal table dominating the center of the room. “You know what this is?”</p>
<p class="cnNjY2YyM2VhYzRiYTQzNzRhYjMxZDQ0NGVhMDVlMmEx">“An aethermap,” Faren said.</p>
<p class="cnM5Njc1OTA2MDk0NzQyMjE5YzY0MTFiOGJiYjhjNmU3">“Ever seen one before?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNmZjYmVhNDNlYTQ4Njg4NzE2NDFjMmRhNWRjN2Q2">“Only on paper.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGE0OTY0ZGUzZTQyYTI4MWNiNjAyNWIzNTA2Njcw">“Well, check this out!” Finella pressed a button and suddenly the metal table became alive as hundreds of thousands of tiny needles rose up to form a topological map of the continent below them. Valleys and mountains formed and Faren quickly found himself identifying familiar locations.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGE1MjNlNGRiMTQ3MjdiNDg3ZmMyOGU3ZWU1YTA0">“That’s Kenhoro,” he said, pointing down, “And Tanhae. That must be the Sabanis Channel, right?”</p>
<p class="cnMzYTBjMzkwOWNiNjQwZTU4N2MwNGM1YjIxNGQ3YTIw">“That’s right, and see those little peaks pulsing? That’s the lift engine of the perimeter ships. When the needles move fast like that, it’s a lift engine. However, when it… hmm…” Finella peered around the map for a moment before pointing at a location. “See that peak! See how it’s pulsing like a heartbeat?”</p>
<p class="cnNkZmNhODBlYTNjMjQwMmJiYjFmZDZkM2UzODY3OGE2">“I see it.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDUyMWEzNWRmOTQzNzY4YmEyZDZlMGM3MTczZDA4">“That’s an arcwhale! A lot of them migrate during storm season here in the east! This one’s alone, but in a few weeks they migrate in <em>swarms</em>. It’s awesome to see!”</p>
<p class="cnM4Mjk3ZWY5MmI4NTRlNWU4YmEyYTNlMGE4ZmU0NWU0">“When we’re active sensing,” Mangs piped up from the door, “never point the aetherscope at an arcwhale. A brief sweep on low power is acceptable, but a focused one will cause it pain, and if we cause it pain, we’re a problem for them.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjBmMDZiZTQ2MDQ5ZTc4MjJhMmYzMTZhOTI0MmE4">“And if that happens, Rhaknam will come and kill us all!” Finella said with a grin. “Well, maybe you lot. I’ll jump from the island!”</p>
<p class="cnMxNGQ2NmNkYWRjOTRkNDViMjY5NzVjZjdmYzQ0NWQ3">“Right, no pinging arcwhales.” Faren nodded. “I’ve never seen one in person. Can you see them from the island?”</p>
<p class="cnM5MWY4NWY0ZGFmMDRlZjI5NDA3OGUyZGZmZTI4NzNk">“On the right day, you can!” Finella said. “We have some telescopes we use for visual identification of close-range ships. When I’m not on shift, I like to try and spot them. Some of them are absolutely <em>massive</em>!” Her enthusiasm made Faren think that perhaps Finella was in the wrong career.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTZmYTM3NDQzOTRjZGJhZDUzZjFmYTI4NGRlM2Fk">“So, traffic along the channel. Avoid arcwhales… anything else?” he asked.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzJkNGI4NzJjMTQ4MTViMWJiM2MyZmNjNTY1ZTgx">“Yes!” Finella dug a leather-bound book from a shelf. “This is the log for Spoken Words. Extremely important!” She shook the book in front of Faren’s face. “If you pick up a Word, record it first, then wake everyone up. Mangs has a bunch of protocols he needs to follow when it happens. Like here…” Finella flipped open the book before showing Faren a page.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2Q0MjQ0NzFmMTRhNTI5MmEyN2JmNWE5YmY5MmNh">“A few weeks ago, three Words were Spoken down below in Kenhoro. Did you hear anything on the broadsheets?” In answer to Finella’s inquiry Faren shook his head. He focused on the logs that recorded the magnitude, pitch and frequency of the Spoken Words.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmM0YjRiMzQ3ZTQ0NDM5Y2VjYTRjMDg2MGMwYmZh">“<em>Narean</em>, <em>Salinas</em>, and…” Faren paused in concentration as he tried to remember the tables he had spent so long memorizing. “... And <em>Taruna</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNzEyNjBlYzY4ODRjNmFhNmU5ZWExZTc5YjI2NDg4">“Oh, you know your stuff!” Finella exclaimed. “We’ve got the cheatsheets for reference, but it doesn’t sound like you’ll need them. But look at this…” Finella showed him some further records from the next few dozen seconds after the initial Words were Spoken. “See this? It’s a <em>Taruna</em> chant. Must have been a big fight. And then this…” Finella pointed to some further logs. “The aetherfield went <em>wild</em> for a moment. One of the Speakers did something really <em>weird</em>. Rabbie was on duty then and said the aethermap went <em>crazy</em>. We still don’t know what it was!”</p>
<p class="cnMzNWQzNjc4ZjgyMTRjMjE5NzJjOGE3NzY3YjIyZjVl">Faren examined the logs but found his memory didn’t help with a clear answer. Such things could be expected. They didn’t have reliable logs of every Word, spell, or chant that existed.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjcwOWEyYzYxYzQ0ZjdhMzdhZjgwMGUwM2U2OGY4">“Want to give it a go? Just so I know what you’re doing?” Finella asked.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTViOTNkZWNmOTQ3MGE4MWJjZDZiYzg0MjE3Yjc0">“Sure. What do you want me to do?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDA4MWJmNzQ0ZTQ2NzI4MjkzNTRhZTUyYjg0Njk4">“See that signal?” Finella pointed at southern portion of the aethermap. “What’s that?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NTg1YzFjYTQ3YzQ3YmY5NWI4YTIyOGVmNDBmMDMx">“A lift engine,” Faren answered, identifying the fast pulsing of the needles. “Running fast. A cutter, maybe? Going south to Shimashina.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTIxZGY2M2M0MDRhZDhiYzhiNmU4NTk0NDA3NzI1">“Now take the controls, focus the aetherscope on it. Don’t ping it, just get records of its frequency and pitch. Then we’ll write out its identifier and see if we can find it in the tables of known ships!”</p>
<p class="cnNjY2I2ZTA5ODQ2ZDRhYWE4NGVmNjAxNDBkZjM1NjNj">Faren sat at the table of controls and began fiddling with the knobs that controlled the various mechanisms of the aetherscope. The desk was slightly elevated and overlooked the aethermap. Faren manipulated the controls and the aethermap responded as he directed the machine to turn its artificial eye towards the small slice of the aetherfield the ship was sailing through. A few moments and, instead of the thousand-klick-wide map, they were zoomed in on a small section tracking the moving ship.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmNkODNjM2M2YjRjNzRiZjIxYTQyZmNhOGY4MTM5">“Anything interesting you want to start recording. We have the paper to waste.” Finella leaned over and flipped the switch and the metal arm began scratching away. “What’s the frequency?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMmQ1YmZiYmQxOTQ3MTQ5NjNkZmM5MWEzM2Q3MmFi">“Ten point five, high.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZjgzZTI5YzQ1YjRmYTFhZGRjZjM0YWNhZGZkZmJl">“And the pitch?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNmViMTgxMWI5MzQ3ZmI4ZTQ1OTkzYmU4NjMxMzFi">“Minus fifteen.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGMzY2E3OWM2MDQ0NDI5MDczMWIyNjcyY2MxMzlh">“Classic lift-engine.” Finella pulled a chair alongside Faren and opened another logbook. “We might be able to match it to a known engine brand. What’s the magnitude?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTI2NjI1Y2FjYTRmZmQ4ZTU1OWFjYmVkYmYxYzE4">“It’s, whoa! It spiked!” For a moment, the line on the screens burst into life before settling back down to baseline. “Where’s it gone?” He looked down over the aethermap which was now devoid of any telltale peaks.</p>
<p class="cnMwMTY2NTU1ZmM0YTQ4NmQ4NjAzMzgzNmU4YTVjMWE2">“Zoom out, let’s see if we can find it.” Finella said and Faren played with the controls until the aethermap now displayed a piece of the south a hundred klicks across.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDU2ZDFiNjk2NjRiMWJhYmU1Y2VjYWE4OGVlYmJk">No peak could be seen.</p>
<p class="cnMxN2FkNmQ1YzE4YTQxYTQ4OWU4M2UxYWFjNzI0ODgy">“You said it peaked?” Mangs said, appearing beside him. “Finella, get me that readout.” Something in his tone changed the atmosphere to something less playful. Finella obediently fetched the paper readout the metal arm had scratched. She passed it to Mangs, who laid it over the desk.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2NkNjgwODgwMzRhODE4YTM3NWJmMDU4NGJkNWJk">“There!” Mangs exclaimed, pointing at a section of the readout where the arm had inked a sudden rise of magnitude before settling down.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2JlMTI5Y2MxMzQ0ZTI5MzZjYWI5OTRmNWE0ODU3">“Is it…” Finella began before trailing off. Faren felt himself swallow. He had seen diagrams of a readout that looked exactly like this in the training manuals.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTc5YjhiMjQxMzQzOWI4YjNmNWVjN2E0OThiYWQz">“A catastrophic aether reaction. Their lift engine blew.” Mangs said with a grim expression. “There might be survivors. I’ll call it in! Finella-” Mangs was cut off as a siren burst into life. Red aetherlights began flashing and the lines on the screens went wild.</p>
<p class="cnMzYmRhMDRhM2ZkZjRlMmE5YTUwZTNjYzU1Mzk1MTQ5">“What the fuck!” Finella yelled. “What’s that shit!?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NDFhYzY1ODdhODQ5ZGNiNWFiNjg1MTI0MmE5MTIz">“H-hang on!” Mangs yelled back over the noise. He scrambled to a wall and pressed a red button, silencing the sirens.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDlkNzA5MTEzMzRkYjhiMjAwNjNjMGI1NTIxODkw">“I didn’t know we had fucking sirens!?” Finella exclaimed, rubbing her ears. A moment later, Goren, Longhall and another demon Faren assumed was Rabbie appeared at the door.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTAzYmFjMmZmNTQ2YzFiNjc1ZTA4MWE4OWUyMWVm">“Mangs!” Rabbie yelled, pushing through the group and reading the readout on the paper. The demon looked up at his superior officer with wide eyes. “Is it…”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTk5NjcwZWRhYTRhYzY4NmNhZDhiMTE1YzgzYjQ5">“Looks like it,” Mangs grunted. “You got the key?”</p>
<p class="cnMwN2U0ODAyOTQ1ODQ4OGI5MzI5ZGVhYjE1ZDFiNGNk">“Yeah, yeah! Here!” Rabbie produced a key and threw it to Mangs. After catching it, Mangs produced a second key from his person and walked over to a wall safe. With the two keys inserted Mangs turned them both at the same time and opened the safe from which he pulled out a small blue book.</p>
<p class="cnMzOGQ2YThmYWIwOTQ3NzRiOWQ5ZmIxNzgwNzNjMzg1">He pulled a chair against the control desk and began to flip through the book with a grim expression. “Rabbie, magnitude?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYTA5YWY2ZmY0MTQ5OGU5YTc0NmQ2NmM5MjQwMDk2">“It’s… one-” Rabbie shook his head. “Christ. One-hundred and five. Is that possible?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNDRkMGJkNjYzMDQ3MGM5ODRiYzA2MGFkYzc5MGE2">“Pattern?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTBjZWIzMmI1NDRlNmQ5MDQyMTI3NzM4NGNlZGIz">“Type C.”</p>
<p class="cnM5OGQ3ZWRkZTkxYTQwZjhiOWQ1NzM4MzI2MGQyNjAy">“Does it flare at the end?”</p>
<p class="cnNiYTI1OGNjMmExMDQxYzY4MjZkODU3NTNkMjkzYmJm">“No.”</p>
<p class="cnM0YTk0YWQ4NWRmMDRmMGJhNTAyYTJiOTg5ZjYwNzAx">Faren desperately wanted to ask what was going on but decided to keep his mouth shut. While Gorden and Longhall seemed to join him in a pensive silence, Finella had other thoughts.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTM5MmY5OWQ1MDQ2NjliYjk0ZjJlM2Y3NGNjNTUw">“Mangs!” she hissed, “what the fuck’s going on? What were those sirens?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTU5NmE5YjlhMjQ0MzNiYzJjODkxZDNmMjAzZmUz">“They’re set to go off when the aetherfield reports an event of magnitude eighty or higher,” Mangs explained as he flipped through the blue book. “Finella, what’s the typical magnitude of a First Word?”</p>
<p class="cnNmYmNjNDQ2OGRlMjRhMWY4NjdlNDY0NGE3MDNjMzBi">“Sixty-five. Maybe seventy if Spoken by a talented Speaker.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYmVhYjg5NWVlZjQwMjI5YzIxZjVhN2MyNWNkOWE2">“And a Second Word?”</p>
<p class="cnM0N2M2YjZhODdhMDQ0OGI4MzZkOThiYWNlNzJjMTg1">“Umm…” Finella stumbled.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTkxZjczYjZhNzQxOWE4MDg3NWY2MTcyOGQ2Mzhk">“Eighty-five,” Faren said. “Is that why the alarm was set to eighty?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNjY3YjBlOTYyODQ0ODc5MTMyNGQxMmUyMWUyOTZj">“That’s right,” Mangs answered. “Rabbie, frequency?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMjNjNWVjMmI2MDQ2NjM4ZWU5YmUxYzU0NmNhMDA0">“Eight point two, high.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYjcwNGI5NjYxMzQ3ZWY5ODljOGZkNDNiY2MxMWRi">“Pitch?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNWI2ODEzNjY2MDQwY2M5MmQ0MzgwMzY4YTA2YzI4">“Ah… shit,” Rabbie mumbled. “Sorry, Mangs. It’s far into the blue. Thirty-six.”</p>
<p class="cnMzOTRmNzFiN2YwOTQxMWVhNmI1ZGUyNWRhZjRlNDUw">“Blue?” Finella said, her voice taking on an element of nervousness. “Does that mean…”</p>
<p class="cnMyNjYzYTdhODY3ZTQxNzNiZGMxYzY0NDYyN2YxNTYz">“A possible human Second Word.” Mangs grumbled. “On our territory.” For a moment, everyone was silent and the only noise that could be heard was the scratching of Mang’s pencil and the metal arm recording the aetherfield.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2Y0NGMyZGQxZDQxZjQ4ZDZkZjJiOWYyZDc2YmY1">“It’s weird,” Mangs said while tapping his pencil against the blue book. “The closest match is <em>Asclepius</em>. The Second Word of divinity. But this is strange. The pattern matches, as does pitch, but the frequency suggests it was Spoken like it was a demon word. It’s like it was Spoken by a…” Mangs shook his head. “Nevermind. I need to report this. Finella, Rabbie? Log everything. Faren, stand by.” Mangs stood up, turning towards Goren and Longhall. “Double check the aetherscope and the stability of the steam. Make sure it’s operating right.”</p>
<p class="cnMyZDkxN2ZkMWRjMTRmNWNiNzhiMDMzMTQzZDEwMDA1">“Mangs.” Faren couldn’t help himself. “The magnitude was one-hundred and five?” Mangs didn’t reply, instead giving a slight sharp nod.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzBmZjhmNjIyMTRmMDQ5NzBjYzA5OWQyZDhjMmU3">“The scale is logarithmic. A typical Second Word is eighty-five. So this Word is <em>a hundred</em> times more powerful than average?”</p>
<p class="cnMwODM1NWQ2MmQyYzQxZTY5YjhlZTkzYTU3MDA1OTBj">“... That’s right.” Mangs locked eyes with Faren, an indescribable expression on his face.</p>
<p class="cnMwMjM4NzMyZGJlOTRkMWU4YTYzNzk5NmUxZDU4ZjYz">“Could it be… a Third Word? The Empress?”</p>
<p class="cnM5MjMyZTFjZmMwMjRlNGI4NGYwMjk0ODJhN2RlMjY1">“No.” Mangs shook his head. “Even this doesn’t come close to a Third Word.”</p>
<p class="cnM3OWJhMTRmMzk1YzQzMmI5YTBiYmU5NDhlODY3ZmVh">Faren swallowed nervously. “What’s… the magnitude?”</p>
<p class="cnM2M2FlMDgzNmIzZTQ2NTZiNTQ1ZjllMzE0YTAzNTdk">“That information is on a need-to-know-basis,” Mangs said pointedly. “But… Third Word or not…” He looked over the group, taking in their drained faces and eyes of worry.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2E4MDE1ZWNmZjQwYjNhZTRhMTcwZWRlMjc4ZTU4">“The war is about to get a whole lot more ugly.”</p>

      <description>Chapter Thirty-Two: Who Is Amelia Thornheart?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM4YjJiOWIwZDgzNTQ4MzJhZDI4NWE3Mjk5NDFkOWJh"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDIwMDIxMDE4ZjQyM2Y4NGFhNzg4MzVkNTg5ZDM3">In one moment, Serena saw Amelia’s eyes filled with fear, hope, and determination. Then Amelia Spoke, and night became day. The aetherfield twisted and boiled as energies manifested at levels she had never seen or experienced before. These forces didn’t harm her; they simply flowed about, announcing to the world, ‘<em>I am here!</em>’.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTlkZmE1YzliYzRhNGJhNjlkOGNmNjgyYzUyOTI4">Then the night returned, and Amelia was gone. In her place, a pair of gigantic taloned feet gripped the ship, each one large enough to wrap around Serena’s body. She gulped and turned her head upwards to see that much of the night sky was covered by a pair of enormous black feather wings. Each stretched for more than a hundred feet, and the dark feathers twinkled with hints of colour, reminding Serena of the sky during moonrains, where the crystals burned up in the atmosphere in bright flashes.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjlhZDg1Y2E2YjRiNTlhZGJlZTU4ZmU0NGE2MzE5">Much of Amelia’s elongated form was now covered in the same dark feathers. They covered her shoulders, chest, and arms in layered patterns that reminded Serena of scale armour. She had to do a double-take but saw that Amelia now had <em>four</em> arms, each ending in a four-finger hand, boasting nails that looked as sharp as any aura-covered sword.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTQwNzE5NjdkZTQ4NTZiMWU5MTdlZjA0ZmExMmMz">The parts that weren’t covered instead boasted pure white fur. White fur. That brought a memory to the forefront of Serena’s mind. <em>Asclepius</em> was described as a great winged angel with shining white fur and glowing golden feathers. Amelia’s wings should be golden, not <em>black</em>. Also, what was with her talons and nails? There had been no mention of an <em>Asclepius</em> embodiment looking like… like <em>this!</em></p>
<p class="cnM0MGExYTEzZTMzMTRjNmI4Y2JhNDcxZjZkNWRiYTJm">Wasn’t she bigger than she was supposed to be? Fifteen meters was the number she remembered but Amelia seemed to be almost <em>double</em> that. A four-armed, thirty-meter-tall angel with black wings and feathers. Serena tried to get a good look at Amelia’s face, which was turned away from her, facing the night sky. She could tell it was heavily feathered with long, sharp ears, similar to the demons in the far west.</p>
<p class="cnM3NzA2MjY5MTFhMTRlZmRhNjQwMjc0YzVmYzA5Y2Ey">“<strong>Scree!</strong>” Amelia made an animalistic noise, its tone sounding alien and unnatural. Amelia’s aether flared, and Serena caught a vague sense of the endless reservoir of aether she possessed. It was a genuinely titanic amount, perhaps more than a hundred First Words.</p>
<p class="cnM2MTA4ZjQyZjMxMDQ2NjViMmE2NDhmYWRiMGQxZjM1">The ship jerked as it suddenly slowed and Serena lost her grip. She was thrown off, causing her to reflexively push her aura into yellow, an action that was easier than normal. Was the presence of Amelia in this form aiding her? Nevertheless, she comfortably wrapped her body in yellow aura and smashed through the forest canopy. For a moment, she tumbled, breaking smaller branches and bouncing inelegantly off the bigger ones.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDdmNjZkZmRhNjQ2YmQ5Y2MzOWI3YWFhZTVkOWFl">Then she was clear, and the forest floor approached her as she flew down past the enormous ironwood trees, each one reaching over a hundred meters in height. Serena landed with a thud, quickly gathering herself and looking up, sensing the <em>presence</em> of Amelia and the ship approaching.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTI4NDUzZjFlZjRmMDQ4MTJkZmUwOTIyMjhhYjMx">The <em>Sakamoto</em> breached the forest canopy first, its weight too much for even the mighty ironwood branches. It tunnelled through, but not before visibly slowing. Amelia followed the ship, still gripping it in her taloned feet. Her black wings sliced through the canopy and Serena could see those feathers were scratching the bark of the ironwood as easily as a <em>shawa’s</em> claws could dig into flesh.</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2Y2MzQ4YTczYTRlYjdhZjM3MzZjZWEzZDUzNzVk">The ship was lowered, its weight counteracted by Amelia’s tremendous reserves of aether pushing against the lumina kilometres below, until it hit the forest floor. The collision was bad enough to crack the ship's hull but not enough to be overly dangerous to those inside. Amelia let go of the ship, which for a moment was balanced perfectly until it fell to one side against the trunk of an ironwood. The ship rolled to the side and fell to the forest floor, and as it did, waves of magic erupted from Amelia’s divine form.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjJhZTM3MGQwNDQwN2FiNzE4ZGNlM2I3MjM5YmY4">The rapid firing of spells that came from Amelia was unbelievable in their frequency and power. As far as Serena could tell, these were healing spells, each one cast far and wide. Unlike Amelia’s previous healing, which was loving and gentle - these instead skipped such superfluous emotions. They hit Serena and simply <em>demanded</em> the body and soul to correct itself, as if any scratch or bruise was an insult to the order of the world. The scratches and cuts Serena faced in the engine room didn’t so much <em>heal</em> as they simply <em>vanished</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmJhNzFmYTQ4MDRlNjdhNDVmYmViNTgyYjE2OTM0">Whatever condition the travellers were in previously, they were surely all better now.</p>
<p class="cnM5NThiNmFjODg5YjRlNGFhOWFlMDdkYTg4OWM3NWIy">Serena looked at Amelia, who must have sensed her presence because she turned her face, locking their eyes together. Serena swallowed. Amelia’s brilliant blue eyes were gone, and there were no signs of the golden grace of <em>Asclepius </em>either. Instead, two enormous crimson eyes stared back at her, each with one large black pupil surrounded by two smaller ones. For a moment, Serena was transfixed by the otherworldliness of those eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTI2OWQ3NDFjZDQ3NGQ4ZWRjZDdhNmY0OGUzYTg3">“Amelia?” Serena asked, trying to keep the nervousness out of her voice. Amelia was silent, simply observing her as she hovered in the air. The giant face tilted in confusion, or maybe it was curiosity.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTY3NTdiZTZjMjQwZWE5Zjg0YTQ2NjIyM2MzZTI3">Amelia’s mouth opened, consisting of pearly white teeth. “<strong>Demon…</strong>” she said in an alien voice that sent shivers down Serena’s spine.</p>
<p class="cnMzMjU4MDUzZmE5ZTQ1Y2I4NjQwYjk1NWIyNmNiOTFl">Serena’s mind raced. This was the first time Amelia had ever Spoken the Second Word. She didn’t know too much about what it entailed - Speakers with such capability were not that forthcoming regarding what happened. She did know that the first time was the most difficult, and hardest to control. How much of Amelia’s mind was her own, and how much was <em>Asclepius</em> influencing her?</p>
<p class="cnM1MWE5NTk5ZTIwMTQ5NDZhNjUwNGFhY2ZkZTY4MWFj">“<strong>Scree!</strong>” Amelia screamed into the night sky, before clambering onto a tree, her sword-like nails and scythe-like talons easily digging into the ironwood bark as she made her way away from the crash site.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2VkYjUyNTgzNjRjZjliOWI0YjczZTBiMmJhMjll">Where was she going? Serena didn’t know, but knew she had to chase after her. She ran after Amelia. Passing the fallen ship, she could hear cries of surprise and fear from within the vessel but no sounds of pain. Something Amelia had done had also put out the flames, as only the slightest whisps of smoke escaped the hull. Serena left the ship behind and delved deeper into the forest after Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDI4ZjQ4ZWY1OTQ1MGY5NTBmMTRlOThhNTQ5ODM3">Making her way through the enormous ironwoods, Serena felt small. Very small. These trees were the ancestors of the wilderness that dominated the continent a thousand years ago - and they were still here, standing tall and proud. Each one of these trees contained tens of thousands of cubic meters of wood. Each one could be used to build a thousand homes or a dozen small ships. That is, if you put in the extraordinary effort to cut through the metal-like bark and defend yourself against the wilderness’s inhabitants.</p>
<p class="cnNkZmEyNzUzNmQ3NjQwNjM4Y2EzMmNiNjhjODQ4Zjc2">Speaking of, where were they? Serena’s senses were tremendously heightened by the yellow aura she cloaked herself in, yet she couldn’t sense any monsters at all. Could they sense Amelia? Were they avoiding her? She gritted her teeth and ran on through the dark forest. Amelia was her priority.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDUyYTJmMDlhNDRlMTc4OGQ2ODQ5OWIwMDIwMDc3">Stopping atop a rise in the terrain, Serena peered through the darkness. Amelia was gone, and Serena couldn’t see or hear her, but she <em>could</em> sense her. It was almost like they were tethered. Serena just <em>knew</em> where she was. It wasn’t a matter of her aether picking up on the fluctuations caused by Amelia’s vast reserves. It was something more, something deeper. It was as if there was a line linking them together. A line she couldn’t see but could feel at the very tip of her enhanced senses.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjFmZTIzZmZlODQ5YzliOTAxNDA2NWQyOGQ1YTM1">She ran for a few more minutes, covering several kilometres as her aura-enhanced body put the best athletes to shame. Rounding a large ironwood tree, she stumble across a clearing.</p>
<p class="cnNjOWNkYzNlMzJiNDQ0NTI5YjE1MjJmZDU5MjAzNDcx">In the centre lay Amelia, her enormous feathery body curled into a ball, black wings folded tight. Her white fur glowed under rays of moonlight flittering through the forest canopy. Serena could see the huge body rise and fall as the angelic being breathed.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTg3NGE5NDU0ZjRhOTA4YzQ1YzMwNWM3YzQ3MzQy">Serena couldn’t help but think it looked like Amelia <em>belonged</em> in the vast wilderness. It was almost natural to see this unnatural entity in an unnatural environment.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDJlMTFlOGJiZTRlMjg4NGM3ZGU5MmVlMjdlY2Y5">No. Amelia was hers. Amelia belonged to her and her to Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnMzOGQxMDcxNThhNDQ0ZjA4ZDIxY2Y1Y2RmOTY0Yjc4">Serena cautiously approached the resting giant. After only a few steps, Amelia raised her head, facing her with those crimson alien eyes that seemed to see not only her but <em>through</em> her as well.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTZjYjUwNDM4ZDQyNDM4OTgxZGUxZDAwOWE4Yjkz">“Tired?” Serena asked with a weak smile. She didn’t really know what to say, only that she felt an overwhelming need to be here, with Amelia.</p><span class="cjZiNjg2YWUxM2I3ODRlOTNhNjVlMzk3NDkxMzBkYjQ4"><br/>The author's narrative has been misappropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjODIwYTE1MmUwNTQyODQ4NDI3MDU1ODNhZjdhZjVl">Amelia didn’t respond. Instead, she repositioned so she was standing like an animal, with her four arms and legs supporting her weight. Honestly, she was behaving more like a <em>peeka</em> than a person. Her enormous black wings kept half-expanding and then retracting as if she didn’t know what to do with them.</p>
<p class="cnMxOWEwNjMxODEwMDQ2NDRiMmQwZTZmN2I0ZWRiMWY5">With an awkward movement, Amelia approached Serena. Her approach seemed almost cautious, which in itself was weird considering how strong Amelia was. As Amelia pushed her face towards Serena, she was reminded once again of how <em>massive</em> Amelia was. Her head was almost as big as Serena's body. The somewhat human face amongst all the feathers looked strange, and those crimson eyes never left Serena.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzUyNjBmZjQzYTQ1YmI4ZDdhZTMzMGVlNTQ5Mjhj">“<strong>I am…</strong>” Amelia intoned, as she <em>pushed</em> Serena with her face, forcing Serena to stumble before getting her bearings. It wasn’t an aggressive push, but one of curiosity, like an animal finding a strange toy. “<strong>Who… am I?</strong>” Amelia mumbled, before sniffing Serena.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDEwYTYxNjRmMzQzOGM5N2E1YmUxYzQyY2Q0YjJk">“You’re… you’re Amelia,” Serena said. “Amelia Thornheart. Remember?” Amelia’s face frowned at that, and she looked like she was struggling with something.</p>
<p class="cnM3NWZiOGVkMWNiMDRhNjNhY2Q5YTYxYTU2Mjg4Yjc4">“<strong>Amelia…</strong>” Amelia circled Serena, using all six of her limbs to pace around her. “<strong>Who… what… is Amelia?</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnM4NjQ2YTFjYTQ1OTQ5YTY5MWY0OWY3MzRkNTAzZmQ2">“You are Amelia. You are <em>human</em>.” Serena put a bit more force into her words. “You’re my… my <em>friend</em>.” Serena resisted a sigh. “My <em>maid, </em>remember?” She swallowed. “My <em>lover</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMTJjMTJhODA2MzRjNDA5Mjk4YmZhNDJiNTczNTFj"><em>And the person I love,</em> she said silently to herself.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWRlOWM5MThhZDRlZTI5ZjJhZWNkZGIwNzI1YjRl">“<strong>Ah…</strong>” Amelia nodded. A wild grin, so large it almost seemed too big for her face, appeared before being replaced by an expression of confusion. “<strong>So I am</strong><strong><em>… </em></strong><strong>Amelia…</strong><em>”</em></p>
<p class="cnM2OWNmZWY3Zjg3NzQ2NDE4ZjMxZmQ5NmNhNjAyZmIw">“Yes, do you remember me?” Serena reached out a hand and Amelia sniffed it. She slowly reached forward before placing a palm on Amelia’s enormous cheek. It felt soft and warm. Serena moved her hand to the side, where Amelia’s dark feathers began. When she made contact, they felt as hard as metal, but something changed, and they became flexible and silky. Not knowing what else to do, Serena began awkwardly stroking them, moving her hands behind Amelia’s long and sharp ears. Amelia responded, leaning her head and neck down.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzBhMWZhMjYxNDRkYmM4YzEyNzgxZDViMGQ1OTBh">“<strong>Amelia… Thornheart… me…</strong>” Whatever was happening, Amelia seemed to be coming around, so Serena kept stroking the feathers. Then, Amelia’s breathing started to change, a low rumble could be heard as she breathed. The noise grew louder quickly. It sounded like a propulsion engine.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2ZhN2UzZmI5MzQ4OWM5MTU0NzcxMmI0MDkwMDNi">Amelia was purring.</p>
<p class="cnM2NjViZjIyZmUyMTQxZDU4OGVjMDZiMGEzN2Q2Yzcx">Trying to ignore the ridiculousness of the situation, Serena began recalling events to Amelia. She avoided topics of fights and battles, instead recounting other times. When they caught sardis, and Amelia had to wash plates up for hours under the stern eyes of the head cook. When Amelia discovered toffee apples and other sweet things. When they had loqua for the first time. When they had danced.</p>
<p class="cnMwZmVhZjM0NmRlOTQyMmM4NzA5ODNiM2NiM2I0MmVl">Serena prattled on, not knowing how long had passed. An hour? Two? Serena eventually ran out of things to say, and Amelia had been quiet for a while, with only the sound of her purring filling the clearing. “Hey,” Serena whispered. “You there?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OWJkZDdjZTMzYTRjYmI5YTZjYjY2ZWI3YzNlOWM3">Amelia turned her head and Serena noted it was looking more… <em>human</em>. “<strong>Mmm… thank you, little Ren.</strong>” Amelia smiled, and a red bulge appeared between her lips. The sight of it confused Serena for a moment, and just as she realized it was Amelia’s tongue, that very same tongue darted out and licked her from the knees to her forehead.</p>
<p class="cnNjYjNjZGUwZGQ4MDRkNmFhMGFhM2U0ZThlYjNhYWZm">This idiot!</p>
<p class="cnM3YjMzZjJlYWVhYjQyODk4NTkyN2U5MzZiMWFlMTNi">Serena wiped the saliva from her face. Amelia chuckled, the noise of which sounded deep and rich, somewhere between a human and… something else. “<strong>Imagine that between your legs! Har har!</strong>” Amelia grinned wildly, and Serena saw a familiar twinkle of cheekiness in those crimson eyes.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDBhYTU0ZmUxNTQ4OGM4OGQ3ZTJjYzgyMWIzOGFj">Well, it was definitely Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDVmZDgyMjllZjQ5ODNhYTUwNjYxYWRiOTU3NWU4">“Are… you back then? You know yourself?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNWQ1ZWIwODdkYzQ5OGM4NThmMWZlM2FjZDE5OTMx">“<strong>Yes… I was lost for a moment. </strong><strong><em>Asclepius </em></strong><strong>was </strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> a happy bunny!</strong>” Amelia shook her head, the action causing her feathers to ripple, like waves on a lakeshore.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzYwMGRjNDY3MTQxMGNiZmY0NDhiNDU4MWM2Mzk4">Serena almost asked what in the seven hells a <em>bunny</em> was but stopped herself. Now wasn’t the time. “How do you feel?” she asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTRlZDU2NDA0YjRjMjg5YjZiNjNkZjdiYmJkODQ2">“<strong>Powerful! And…</strong>” Amelia stood up, twirling as she stretched and unfolded her wings. The clearing wasn’t quite big enough, and her wings slammed into the trunks of the nearby ironwood trees. The bark cracked and a large number of branches and leaves fell around them. “<strong>... And strange,</strong>” Amelia finished, before looking around at seemingly nothing. “<strong>I see so much more. Other planes. Layered upon this one.</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnM5NTk0NTBkZDRiZDQ3MjhiZjdjOTdjYWVmMjJmYTRj">“You can see the seven hells? The heavenly halls?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NzRiMjJjYTgwYzQ5YWE4OGM1OWQxMWE2M2VmYTVi">“<strong>Maybe. It might be something else. I can see things moving around in them. They can see me too, I think.</strong>” Amelia stopped looking into nothing and focused on Serena. “<strong>How do I look? Am I magnificent? Look! I have four arms!</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnMwYmQ4YTk5MDg0NTQ3YmI4NmRjMGU0ODU2NDNkNGJm">“You look… breathtaking.” Serena took a few steps back so she could fit Amelia’s huge frame in her vision. “However… I think I prefer you smaller. How can I ever hold you now!?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZWI5ZDg5NmEwYjQ4MGI4ZWExYjMyMjQ4YWE2M2Fi">Amelia laughed. “<strong>You could ride me! Into battle!</strong>” Serena smiled. A ridiculous idea. Any battle Amelia involved herself in <em>that form</em> would be a battle Serena would have little impact in. What Amelia was, what she had become, was on a whole other level.</p>
<p class="cnM1OGQ5YjBlNGMxZTRkMGE4NWMwNWNiMzhhOTExZmIy">Serena didn’t know what the following months and years would bring, but the Words Spoken tonight would send ripples across the political landscape of the world. Suddenly, a concern burst into the forefront of her mind and, while trying to keep any notes of panic from her voice, Serena asked, “Amelia, can <em>Asclepius</em> see and hear us?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OWJkZTllN2QzYjRlMjVhZDk3MDcwOTNlMGQ0NmNk">“<strong>Mmm… Yes. The connection is strong. He sees what I see. He hears what I hear. Still… my thoughts are my own.</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnMzN2Q3ZTQ2NjMxODQ0NzM4NDlkNzY5ZjhjMWI3ZmE3">“Is he… talking to you?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMWJlNmMxNTUzYzQyMGZhNDNjNjVjMDljOGYyYmEw">“<strong>He was. Now he’s sulking. Har har! What a baby!</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnM0ODhiZmVhMTAyMTRkNTliOTdjMzJmZTVkY2M5NzQ5">Serena forced a smile. If <em>Asclepius </em>could see what Amelia - fueled by his power - had become, then that knowledge would be shared with the human church. In fact, he might be sharing it right now. Serena bit her cheeks as her thoughts raced. If, no, <em>when</em> the human church got word of this event, that the form of <em>Asclepius </em>had been - in their words - <em>corrupted</em> with demonic traits, red eyes and black wings, then… then…</p>
<p class="cnMxMTU1OTJkYTdjZDRhMTg4OTlmODg0MGM0NjhkNjRk">It would be war.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODgxZGM3OTIwZTQzYTVhNTUxMDJlODgxNjVmM2Ix">“<strong>What’s wrong?</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnM3OTdmOWMxY2VkMzQyYzU5YzE4ODcwMGFiMGZiZjhi">“Thinking about events… and the ship,” Serena told a half-truth. “A rescue vessel should come within the next twelve hours. We’ll need to protect the ship from the local wildlife.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZjExN2FmOGNhMzRmOTlhM2I3OTVkNTM4ZTg3YTc4">“<strong>Ah… I can sense them. Hiding so far away. Hiding from me…</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnMzZmZjYTA1MGFhODQzODZiYjk5ZjdhZTJkMjJhYTQw">“But we can’t have you staying in that form! Can you… change back?” Serena asked. If Amelia stayed as she would, how could she explain it to the travellers on the ship? Or to whoever was on their way to rescue them? With the magnitude of the Second Word, every Speaker in the East would have sensed it. It wouldn’t surprise Serena if the overlord himself was moving to meet them.</p>
<p class="cnMzMzk1OTJiMjlhMTQzZGI5MzU5YTY2ZTliM2JlNmY3">“<strong>I’m not sure how… I think-</strong>” Amelia went silent, something interrupting her thoughts. “<strong>Ah… thank you, </strong><strong><em>Asclepius</em></strong><strong>. How very helpful.</strong>” Well, it appeared the deity was only too happy to assist Amelia in breaking their connection. Serena couldn’t help but feel a touch of sympathy for the poor human god that had Amelia storm into his life, much like Amelia had to her own.</p>
<p class="cnMwMzgyMDgxYzdmYTQ2ZGM5MTFkZjg3Y2RhMjYxMjJi">“Before that… did you heal everyone on the ship?” Serena was sure Amelia had, but she wanted to make sure. The nature of whatever spells Amelia had cast, which must have been somewhere in the seventh, eighth or even ninth tier, was beyond her ability to comprehend.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzA1MjYwNjQxODRiNzI4ODdhZmRhMmQyMDNkYzY5">“<strong>Yes… even my friend…</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnM4ODgwMWZkN2ZjYTRjMDI4MDE2MGUyZmY3MGYxOGRi">“Your friend? Oh.” Serena looked away, feeling guilty. “She’s alive, then?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMzU1M2JjNTdkZTQ1MDFhZTE3N2VlZjI5YmQ4NDBk">“<strong>Her body was broken, but the soul hadn’t yet left. I remade her.</strong>” Amelia sniffed, and her enormous eyes wobbled slightly. “<strong>Why didn’t you tell me, if you knew?</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnNlOTNhMmY2MTY3YzQ3OGNhMWNlMjk4NmE1MzBiMWNh">Serena shuffled her feet awkwardly, “Her background check did come back clean! Only after your last meeting did I push deeper; we found out she was a Federation spy.” Serena sighed. “Remember what I told you? That people would approach you, pretending not to know you? Still… you seemed happy you had a human friend… so I let it go.” Serena clenched her fist. “But I can’t anymore. Somehow she, or people she was working with, put a bomb on the ship. She tried to <em>kill us</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYmMzNTA3MDdmYjRkMmViYjEwOTc5OTgwYTEyMzg4">“<strong>It was no bomb</strong><strong><em>,</em></strong>” Amelia said as softly as her mighty form could manage.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGQ2NGUwMGU0NjQ2YWU4ZTRmYjk5MWIzODgzZWQx">“What?”</p>
<p class="cnM3N2QxODFmNjFhNTRhNmFiY2U0Y2Y4NDQ5NmEwNzA4">“<strong>She has a blessing. Two of them. I can see them on her soul. I can see her right now.</strong>” Amelia peered into the distance, eyes focused on a point beyond the ironwood trees.</p>
<p class="cnM1NTI5NjBiNjVkYzRhMzlhZWU0ZWU3YzhlZTQwYTBj">“<em>What!?</em>” Ignoring the fact Amelia could <em>see</em> blessings, the knowledge someone had <em>two</em> of them was something she would reject if it wasn’t coming from Amelia’s mouth. Never before, in any conversation, text, or lesson had she ever been made aware that such a thing was possible.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2YwNmEyYTlhOTRmYzVhYzMwZDg5N2VjYzZiMjVh">“<strong>I’ve put her to sleep.</strong>” A note of sorrow filled Amelia’s voice. “<strong>What’s her real name?</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnNkMWViZjk4ZjU0NjQxZGZiYzIwZTYxYzVlYjA3ZjJh">“... Polina,” Serena said. “Polina Volkova. She was part of a Federation cell operating in Kenhoro. We discovered them the morning we left. It was why everything was so rushed.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MzIxZDIwYjk1NDRjOTdiMTY2OWU1YTY4M2FiMTI1">“<strong>Polina…</strong>” Amelia mumbled. “<strong>Polina. Not Tatiana. Polina…</strong>” She sniffed. “<strong>Nice name.</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnNhODQ4ODQzYWFkYTQyN2I4YWVlMmNlODBkNzBjM2Iw">“She’s <em>not</em> your friend,” Serena said sternly. “Remember, she <em>blew up</em> the ship. Condemned a hundred demons to die for a chance to <em>kill us</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2E1MmU0YmY5OTQwMjk4NzVlNjJlZjVmNjc1OGZi">“<strong>Maybe. Yet… she blew herself up, right? Tatiana- I mean, </strong><strong><em>Polina </em></strong><strong>didn’t seem like someone to martyr themselves.</strong>” Amelia shook her wings, “<strong>Maybe there was a reason. I want to talk to her.</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnMxZjQwNTJjMWEyMzQyMWJhMGNmMzE3ZDZmNzhjYzhm">“In… that form?”</p>
<p class="cnM1Mjc1ZDMzYzhmMTQ1N2FiMTMzMThlODJmMWMxNmRj">“<strong>Yes. Until I know the nature of her blessings.</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnNlM2ExZWQwZmJjZjQ3YzY4ZTM4N2UyMjUxYTg3ODYz">“Shall I… bring her here?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzhhYjJlMTczYTQyNDE4ZjQ4YjI3MGJjNDNkZGI0">“<strong>No. I’ll put everyone else to sleep. Bring her outside the ship, if you could… uh, please.</strong>”</p>
<p class="cnMwM2YwOGE1YzA4ZDRkZjI5YTA3ZDI0YTlhODIyNzIz">Serena sighed. If it weren’t for Amelia’s healing, she would have a headache right about now. Even so, the urge to grab her horns in frustration was highly tempting. Why did things keep getting more and more complicated!? She had never felt so uncertain about the future. What would happen when Amelia talked to that spy? What would happen when she met her father? What awaited them in Shimashina? Questions upon questions.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTI5ZjU5MTlhYzQ4ZDA4MzVmYTBmNDY4ZTQ5N2M2">Ah, whatever. She’ll go along with the flow. She’d rolled her dice, and they’d landed firmly upon Amelia. What’ll happen will happen. War or no war. As long as she was there to help manage the walking disaster that was her girlfriend, things would eventually turn out alright, right?</p>
<p class="cnM2YzgxMDQzYjIwMTRiZDVhYzA3YTU3ZWRmNWE5Yzg1">“Come on then,” Serena said, guiding Amelia back through the trees.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDFjYmFlMTYwYTRhMWNhYjA0NDM4ZWI0ZjRiNTE0">It was time for an awkward conversation.</p>

      <description>Chapter Thirty-Three: Interrogation I</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNjMTA2M2ZlNWM3OTRmYzI4YzYwNDNiZDhmODM1YjMz"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNiZDQyMzM3OThjMjQ4MWVhMDk1N2M3YmYwMGUwNzkw">With every step, Amelia felt herself bond closer to her divine form. She walked on her six limbs, as the movement felt more natural given her elongated body. Her talons were razor sharp and easily sliced through earth, stone, and wood. Her great wings were difficult to control entirely, but depending on her will, they could become an impenetrable shield or wall of soft feathers.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDRmMTJkOGQxYTQzYTI5NWZhN2M0YWFhYzk0M2M4">The endless ocean of aether inside her begged to be used, circulating throughout her body and pushing her senses to new heights. It wasn’t just the feeling of her vast reserves; Amelia could feel her body drawing in the aetherfield. It was like she was a vacuum, and the ethereal substance was rushing to fill her up. At the same time, she was continuously expelling aether back into the atmosphere, creating a continuous process that she could only describe as <em>breathing</em> aether.</p>
<p class="cnMzMGU5ZTkxYWJmODQ3NDVhNTViM2Q4MWFmNGFiNDI4">Her perception had grown tremendously, and her ability to process information had similarly caught up. Before, she could <em>sense</em> the aether inside someone to gauge their strength, but now Amelia could <em>see </em>it. The aether inside people appeared like a shimmering light, not blocked by earth or trees. She could count the people in the ship, unmoving due to her magic; a low-level sleep spell thrown far and wide from the branch of <em>Kanaxai</em>, the demon god of illusion and trickery.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTM5OTFjYmUxYzQ1M2U4Y2YxNDBlMWVmMjYxZmZh">She could also see the aether signatures of creatures many kilometres away, keeping their distance. She was strong and mighty, and everything around her knew it! It was a shame, as she hadn’t actually seen what they <em>looked</em> like. Serena had always referred to them simply as the ‘local wildlife’ but the way she had described some of them they sounded more like <em>dinosaurs</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNiZmQ4YjdmZDExZjQ0Yzk5NTg1NmI1ODgyNWZiNjBh">Amelia turned in a few circles while Serena clambered through the ship on her mission to bring the healed and sleeping Polina out. She wasn’t entirely sure what she was going to say, but it didn’t matter much. What was done was done, and if Amelia hadn’t been there, everyone onboard would have died. Amelia cast her feathered head down in thought before breaking out into a happy grin, distracted by the sight before her.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTA2NWQ3OGIzNjQ2MGJiYWVmYjFmNjgyOGEyNzBm">How the ground sparkled! Thousands and thousands of moon crystals buried beneath the surface shone like the purest night sky. Like herself, the crystals didn’t produce aether; instead, the aetherfield was pulled <em>through</em> them, causing them to shine! Even in the giant trees that made up the forest, she could see a slight current of aether flowing through their roots. Aether appeared to be more closely intertwined with life than she had thought!</p>
<p class="cnNiZGRiMTc5MzcyNjRhMDlhM2I3ZmYwYjI3NDI1NzE1">There were also other things. Aether signatures that didn’t seem to be a part of this realm. They were about as bright as Serena’s signature, but none came close to her strength. They kept their distance but were evidently curious about her as they seemed to follow and circle her cautiously, maintaining a distance of about a kilometre. Whatever they were, did she look the same in their eyes? A bright glowing ball?</p>
<p class="cnM2NzhmODcxYTE0YzQyMDRhZWEyMWY1Mjk3MGNhYjc4">Whatever this other realm was, it seemed to be layered upon this one. Her curious friends seemed to follow the same terrain as her, avoiding the same trees. Was there another copy of Cascadia, existing alongside this one? How would that work, and what did it mean? She would ask Serena about it later, although she suspected this might be a bit beyond the knowledge of her brilliant girlfriend.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDNmN2UzMzFmZTQ4NTNiMjI1ZmNlZGQ3YjBkMTFh">Tatiana- no, <em>Polina</em> was carried out by Serena and thrown against the base of an enormous tree. Amelia raised one enormous feathered eyebrow at Serena, who gave her a shrug in response. Polina stirred but didn’t respond; waking someone from her sleep spell would take far more than that.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzE2YmMxM2M4YTQ2NGRiZWMzMjcxNWYxOTJkODc4">Polina’s hair was unkempt, and her face and body were covered in dirt and grime. Where did she live, in the sewers!? Her clothes were tattered, although not to the point of being immodest. With a quick burst of aether Amelia cleansed Polina’s body.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTFkZTgzY2E5ZDQ2MzA5YzI2YWIzYzU4NDNlNWUw">Beyond the flesh, Amelia could see Polina’s soul. It looked like a white cloud, from which little wisps and bits would twist and turn. It was reacting to the aetherfield, or maybe the aetherfield was reacting to the soul. Looking even further, using her Second-Word-enhanced vision, she saw the soul was connected to the mists, the proto-realm connecting all other realms.</p>
<p class="cnMzZTU1MWQ0NmNjNTQxYjM4NzlhMzJmMTQxOWJmNTBk">She wasn’t sure if souls lived in this realm and were linked to the mists or that souls lived in the mists and were linked to this realm. Regardless, Amelia could see the complicated structure of the two blessings layered upon Polina’s soul. She couldn’t quite figure out precisely what gods gave each blessing, but Amelia was certain one was provided by a human god and the other by a demon god.</p>
<p class="cnNmYWY3OGY2NzdkMTRlYTliYTA5NWYxMzJjNjlmMTg5">Well, she would be ready for anything. Amelia was basically invulnerable in this form, and anything that did manage to hurt her could be patched up in the blink of an eye. To ensure the safety of everyone else, Amelia twisted the aether inside her to form an eighth-circle ward, which she casually threw over Serena. The ward was invisible to the naked eye, unlike the lower circle spells she had previously cast that caused a golden glow. This didn’t mean they were cloaked. It shone like a lighthouse in her enhanced vision, disrupting the aetherfield and causing the mysterious creatures from another realm to draw back even further.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjMzN2MyYmQ3NDRmMzRhYWU3ZjRhMjE3NDljYmE2">Amelia then picked another spell and cast it around the three of them, creating a defensive shell that would act as a first line of defense against any attacks going in <em>or</em> out. Ha! She would like to see something try to get through that!</p>
<p class="cnMxY2I0YmYxYjZlMDQ3ZjhiYzI1OWNmODVjMmM1Yzc3">“You just did something ridiculous, didn’t you?” Serena asked her while examining her own body. “A ward? I can barely sense it.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMzFmMjhiMDdkYzQ3MzFiOTk5NWI5ZGI2NTNkNzll">“<strong>Yes,</strong>” Amelia said.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDAxZDc4ZTYyMzRlM2RhNjg1NWM1MjRjZDk3NmFk">“Are you able to control how much aether you’re leaking? If you keep talking with such power in your words, the girl will have a heart attack.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTFiMTgzNGJlYzQ1Y2NhM2NiZjc4YTk0NWZlYjUy">Mmm. That wouldn’t be good. Amelia focused inwards and slowed the flow of aether, both into and out of her body. Interestingly, it wasn’t just the aether that obeyed her command, but the aetherfield <em>itself</em> seemed to want to work with her.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTg4MzZhODg3MTQ0ODE5MTY0YjQxOTFjMzMzODQ4">“How’s this?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnNlMmE1NWM0NzgzNTQ3ZDliOGFjMWZkMGZmNzJkY2Vi">“Much better.” Serena unsheathed her sword. It was only a wooden training sword, but being cloaked in an orange aura, it was far sharper and sturdier than any blacksmith-created weapon. Serena pointed the sword at Polina’s throat. “Shall we wake her up then?”</p>
<p class="cnM2Nzk1MmQyMGI1ODQxODQ5OTViNTA0YjdmOWI1ZjM4">“H-hang on!” Surely they didn’t need to hold Polina at sword-point! It wasn’t like she could escape unless one of her blessings was teleportation. “I think we should approach this in a much more friendly way!”</p>
<p class="cnMwNjU0MDBhY2ZkMjQ1NjQ4MzY0NTY1ODY2ZjU5MDY2">“Oh?” Serena’s mouth curled up. “Which one of us has actual interrogation experience?”</p>
<p class="cnM4YTRmZWJlNWVjZTQ2ZTU5YzM4NTc4OGUxZWE2YmRm">Amelia groaned, which sounded more like a growl in her new form. “I’m just <em>saying</em>. Maybe we should do that thing, you know where one of us is helpful and friendly, and the other is aggressive?” Surely the classic good cop bad cop wouldn’t fail them?</p>
<p class="cnMyZGJjMzViYTA0ZDQ1ZWQ4MDlhNGFiNmFjMDYwMWQx">“You… know about that method?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNTMwMWZmZDU2YjQ2ZDg4MmQ0YmQzMWQxMGJkZGY5">“Sure do! I saw it in shows all the time!”</p>
<p class="cnMyZmJkOGE5NDk2YTQ4YzhiNTE2MjlmYWJmMDI4M2E0">Serena rolled her eyes. “I don’t think your experience with <em>entertainment</em> qualifies. Besides…” She turned her gaze towards Polina. “I think she’s going to be scared regardless.”</p>
<p class="cnM2N2NjYWNkMTk5MjRmZDc4ZDNjOWY5MWMzNGRhNDNk">That was a good point. Waking up in a dark forest, not knowing where you were or how you got there. Anyone would be scared! “Good point!” Amelia chirped, “Maybe you should hide around the tree so it’s just me… what?” Serena was looking at her with a stupified expression.</p>
<p class="cnNjZGExMzNkZjgxZDQ5M2E4N2JjYzAzMWEwNWI2NmI5">“Idiot. You think <em>you’re</em> the less scary one of all of us. You’re a gigantic…” Serena gestured at her with a complicated expression. “Angelic-bird-peeka thing!”</p>
<p class="cnM2MWM1MmRlMDU4MjQ5NTU4ZTU1MWI5NDE5MjM2NWE3">“I know! Don’t you think I look fluffy and cute!?” To emphasize her point, Amelia stood upright on two legs and extended her wings to their fullest extent. It felt incredibly satisfying to <em>stretch</em> her wings. Having a pair of wings was unfamiliar at first, but it was growing on her. She suddenly felt the urge to wrap Serena up like a burrito. Imagining the cute noises Serena would make <em>almost</em> made her do it then and there.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDc2YzY0ODRhOTQ0MDg5OTk1Mjk3NDRjMzM1YTZi">Maybe another time.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGZiYjA4NDE0YTRiMDRhNjRjNDg2NjZkZWI1OTZk">Looking down, Serena and Polina <em>did </em>look very small. How tall had Serena said she was? Thirty meters? That was about the same height as a ten-story building! Maybe she did look scary after all! “Fine…” she grumbled before plodding her way around the back of the tree, coming around and laying on the floor so Polina would only see two of her arms and her head. “You take the lead, and I’ll just… be here...”</p><span class="cjgxNTk3MjBlYzk4NDQ3MDViZDYyZDIyYjgxNzhlZTlj"><br/>Stolen content warning: this tale belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1ZTRmNmQzM2YzMjRjMTBhZDJjN2U3ZGRhZGMwYmFm">“Better. Are you planning on talking?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMTM0MTI4NTAwYjQ5OTA5ZjNhZTI5M2NmZGI0ZmY1">“Sure!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNDQ1OWY1ZWEyOTRhNTU5MzYyYTlmOTU4MjY0ODY0">“Are you… going to let Polina know it's you?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTVlN2Q3MWYxYzRjNjU4NmI1Mjc1YThiNzlkZDY0">“I’m not going to lie!”</p>
<p class="cnMzMmJmYzE5ZWIxMTQ3M2VhYTBmMTgyMDQ2N2NhNTFh">“This is the exact kind of situation where you <em>should</em> lie!” Serena went to grab her horns but stopped herself. After mumbling about having an idiot as a girlfriend, she asked Amelia what she could tell her about Polina’s blessings.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTc3Y2JiYTNmNzRmMjk5OWU0OTY2YzI4MjE3NmRk">“I can’t tell what they do, or which god provided them, but…” Amelia peered again at Polina’s soul. “One of them has a <em>feeling</em> of a human god, and the other a demon god.” Seeing Serena’s eyes widen, she asked, “Is that rare? For a human to be blessed by a demon god?”</p>
<p class="cnM5OGQzNjliNTIzOTRhMGFiNzkyNTYxZjE2OGRhMjc4">“Yes, it’s rare! <em>Two</em> blessings, and one of them from a <em>demon god</em>!?” Serena took a breath. “It’s like… like… another <em>you!</em>”</p>
<p class="cnMwMjkzZWNhMTU4NDQxNDdiMjIyYzhlMGQ5M2RiMDQ4">“Another me?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNTFhNThlNmJiYzRlOGJhNzVmZmYyNjg0YmJmODVh">“An impossible existence! One that breaks all the norms and rules! Ah…” Serena’s head dipped in feigned defeat. “Why does this keep happening to me…”</p>
<p class="cnM3MmVmNzQxY2UwOTQ4ZWM4NTM5NzhmYTVmOGEyZTI3">A thought popped up, “Do you think she could be in a similar situation as me? From another realm?” At her question, Serena eyed Polina for a few cool seconds.</p>
<p class="cnM3MjBlNWEwZjA1NTQzZDlhNDRlNThmMjU3OTMyMzRm">“Perhaps. I guess we’ll find out…” Serena tightened her grip on the sword at Polina’s throat. “Want to wake her up?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzZjMTRiMGNmNzQ1NDFhZjk4MzcwYzkwZDZiOTY1">“Wait!” Amelia exclaimed. “Promise me you won’t hurt her!”</p>
<p class="cnM0MmY1M2Q5ZjNhNDQ1MDBiNjNhYjFmMjk5N2VhMzhh">“I can’t make that promise, she has <em>two</em> unknown blessings and she <em>tried to kill us</em>,” Serena said, looking at Amelia with a resolute expression. “Anything might happen when she wakes. She’s an enemy.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NmM1ZmM2YjYxNTQzMDJhZjg2MTg4YzYyYzJjZWNh">“She’s a friend!”</p>
<p class="cnNhZGY2ZDc2Y2U5OTQ4MmQ5YTZmYzk0ZDRhY2NlZGY1">“You’re being naive! You-”</p>
<p class="cnMxYWNhNzlmNTM0OTQ2ZGU4MzJmOTAzYzdmOTI5MTAy">“<strong>No!</strong>” Amelia’s aether flared as she lost control and Serena took a step back, grimacing. For a moment, a glint of fear appeared in Serena’s eyes, something Amelia absolutely hated to see. “I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” she whined. “I lost control!”</p>
<p class="cnMxYTRlNDZjY2E2MjQzOWI4MDhmZGY1NTAwMjcwYWRi">Serena was silent for a moment. “Are you okay?” she asked, her voice softening. Her eyes had lost any sign of fear and instead looked at her in concern.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTk0ODdkNDNiYjQ0ZDc5OWU4ZDUxMzUxNTAzMzlh">“Yes…” Amelia thought about letting it pass but decided against it. She had to address the matter now, else the doubts would eat away at her in the future. “Did I scare you? You looked scared, for a moment. I <em>hated</em> that… I’m really sorry!” Ah, she was rambling! How awkward! She felt her eyes watering.</p>
<p class="cnM2YmM5ZDBjYzljZDQyNjRhMTUzM2JkNGJhYWE5Njcz">“Are you… crying?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTI4YmZiMmU5MjQzMzk4YjUyZTkzNmU4NjBjNDY3">“No!” Amelia exclaimed as an enormous teardrop fell from her face, splattering on the ground and getting Polina wet. “Great, now I feel all awkward and stupid.” She closed her eyes, forcing two more tears to fall, and dipped her head.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2YyZGVhMDFlNjQyMjFiNjUwNDQ2YmE4OTAxZGVm">Ah, she really was an idiot.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDE4NzFjN2VlMDRiOTlhZjhhYTY4MmFjNjQ1OTVm">She felt two soft hands on her face and opened her eyes to see Serena had sheathed her sword and was reaching up and touching her. “I’m not scared of <em>you</em>, Amelia,” Serena said with a smile. “You have to understand the sheer <em>presence</em> you have in that form. You’re incredibly <em>powerful,</em> and my instincts react to your outbursts. However, I’m not scared of you, understand?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMGRmM2U3NjRhZDQ2MDc4YzAxNjA4MGY3YzBiMzhk">“... I see.” Amelia felt a little better.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzgwMzMwZWQ3ZjQyNDQ5YzhhNmE5ZWM4NDFmMmNk">Serena leaned in and gave Amelia a peck on the cheek.</p>
<p class="cnNkMjhhODlmNjBmYjQ4NGQ5MDIzZjg4ZjBiYWJmMzdh">Now she felt a lot better!</p>
<p class="cnNlNTI1ZWQ4ZWEzZTRjZjRiODkxODkwNmE4ZjVkZDdk">“I know I’m ignorant and naive,” Amelia explained, “but I <em>know</em> I have good instincts. When I first met you, when you burst through the doors and jabbed me with your sword - I wasn’t scared because I <em>knew</em> you weren’t an evil person - the same thing with Tomes, Lord Yulan, or Grandpa Gu. Before people say anything, I can determine their character. I haven’t been wrong <em>yet</em>. Even though Tatiana or Polina or whatever she’s called was deceiving me… I can tell she isn’t a bad person. She wouldn’t knowingly destroy a ship of innocent demons!”</p>
<p class="cnM3MWM1MTViNDY3NzRkNDliNzkyNjc5Yzk3ZmRlNGMy">Serena sighed, tilting her head to the side. With an endearing look, she said, “Alright. No swords and no violence. We’ll figure out why what happened happened, and we’ll figure out how to go from there.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNjYyOWU0YjI5YjQxZjY5ODExNDFlZGRhY2RlMjkz">“What’s likely to happen with her? After we get rescued?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMmI0Nzg5ZmQ3YjQ3YTNhYmUxMzhkNWFiMTcxYWQ5">“It’s not really my choice,” Serena said with a shrug. “I’ll pass it up the chain of command, and she’ll be taken into custody. Her blessings make her a valuable hostage. She’ll probably be traded for a dozen of our own spies who are currently rotting away in some Federation prison.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMTI0NTY3MDc4YjRjMTFiY2Q0ZTM0MWRjMGQzMDdl">“So, she won’t be executed?” Amelia couldn’t help but sound worried.</p>
<p class="cnMyMzI4M2E2ZTIxYjRlMmZiNWM5OTI5ZWE0OGFjNGNl">In response, Serena rolled her eyes. “There are international <em>conventions</em>, and Cascadia <em>does </em>follow them. We’re not in open war with the Federation. The sanctions and military aid aren’t bad enough <em>yet </em>to break down common decency.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YmZlYjQzOWVjMTRhMWFhYjE5M2ZkY2IyMjhmODI4">Although Serena’s emphasis on the word <em>yet</em> caused concern, her assurances were enough for Amelia. “Okay! Shall we wake her up then?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTMwMmZhNGIzODQyZGI4Y2QwOGE2NzhlYThjNjYx">Serena took her position. “Don’t call her Polina. Let her think we don’t know who she is. At first, anyway. Stay out of sight for now, until I can gauge the basic details.” She gave Amelia a nod. “Ready?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YjBkZWRiNzc5NDRmYjVhMzU4ZGMwNGU3NDQ3ZGJj">Amelia backed up a little so Polina wouldn’t see her. While she also couldn’t see Polina directly, her perception and information-processing capabilities were so high that she could easily construct an image of the area from the other side of the tree. With a bit of focus, she found she could perfectly perceive a radius of a few dozen meters around her.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjhjMjIwODhlODQ0ODNhZWUzYTJkZjA3N2VhMjJm">Taking a moment to quieten her breathing, she cut the flow of aether supplying the sleep spell. Polina stirred and mumbled something incomprehensible but otherwise seemed content napping. Serena nudged Polina’s foot, which was missing a shoe.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDlmN2ExM2YxYzRiZmRhYWQwMTdjNjMxMTk1ZTEy">“Wake up!” Serena called out, and Amelia sensed Polina coming around. At first, her eyes opened slowly, but as the alien environment became apparent, her eyes snapped open, and Polina looked around before locking her gaze with Serena.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWY1ZTgzM2ZhNTQ4YjlhZjgzMWY5Y2MwNjkyMDBj">“Are you okay?” Serena asked, putting on an act of compassion. “Not many survived the crash. Amelia told me you were a friend.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMDY3OTJjZWY2MjRlODQ4YmY1MGMwOTA5ZWFkZjdi">At that moment, Amelia saw one of Polina’s blessings activate. It was the one linked to a human god. Its activation barely disrupted the aetherfield, and if someone didn’t have their perception enhanced by a Second Word, then it would be missed entirely. Even more noticeable - at least to her - was the ripple that propagated throughout the mists, something regular spells didn’t cause. Did this mean blessings worked on different principles than ordinary magic?</p>
<p class="cnNhZTg0ODEzMGQ5MzRhMjk5MzMwOGE5ZTA1OWI3Mzcx">As far as Amelia could tell, the blessing didn’t do much. Her powerful wards didn’t register any attack, and Serena seemed unfazed. What was it? What did it do?</p>
<p class="cnMzY2ViZGU3NjU5YTQ0YWQ4M2I2ODM3OTFiNmRmMGRl">“Y-y-y…” Polina was trying to choke out some words. It was as if she was in shock. “You… you… who are… you?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZDYzMThkOGI0NzQ3ZDM4NDlkMmI2ZjQ1N2M5NTFm">“I am Serena Halen, Captain under Greatlord Oshiro of the Eastern Fleet,” Serena said, a distinctive note of pride under her voice. Once again, Polina’s blessing activated to no noticeable effect. “I saw you, in the engine room, before the ship exploded. What were you doing?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMGJkZjZjMDcxMzQyMjg4Y2YxZjk1ZWQ0ZTI1OWM2">“I… uh…” Polina gulped, “I…” She turned and threw up to the side. The poor woman was shaking. Amelia almost reflexively cast some healing but held back. It didn’t make her happy at all, to see Polina like this. “I was a stowaway… hitching a ride…”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjZmNGNiMThkMjQ2MGI4NzE3NjQ3ZTk3NzUwZmIw">“Trying to get… where?”</p>
<p class="cnMwYmIxMGQ2Zjg5MTQ3NzY5ZmY0Njg0ZDlkNGFiY2Vk">“Anywhere… I had nowhere to go…” Polina closed her mouth and Amelia sensed she was running her tongue around her mouth. It was a weird action, and she couldn’t understand why she was doing it. “How am I…”</p>
<p class="cnM3MDVlMTE4ODkxZDQxYWU5MDRkYjRmZmZjOTdhMWRi">“Alive?” Serena interrupted. “Amelia healed you.” Polina’s blessing activated again, and Amelia detected another disruptive echo in the mists.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTkxMTRiNzhiMTQyNjdiNTRhYTQ5NmExMzhlZjZj">“<em>A titanic amount</em>…” Polina whispered seemingly to herself. “Amelia… is here?” she asked nervously. “Where is she?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZDI3N2U1ZGRmYzQyMTFiZTNmMjFlMmE1YTNhMTc0">“Still in the ship, recovering from using up so much aether.” Again, the blessing fired. Was it activating whenever Serena talked? Polina looked around again, even up at the forest canopy where only a few beams of moonlight broke through the dense greenery.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTlhZGZjMmRkMDQwNWE4NDU2MTc0NzBkY2YwMTg5">“Are we…?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNWI0M2Y3NGJmMDQxOTE4YWJlYzk2OTJmYzM2Mjkx">“On the forest floor, yes.” Serena nodded. “I’m sure a rescue ship is already on its way.”</p>
<p class="cnMyN2E0MGQ1YjVhYzRhODhiZWJmNzdjNzk5MWQyNzVh">“T-the monsters!”</p>
<p class="cnMzMTljZmU2MjM5NTQyNGE5YzI2MDlmOWFhYjFmODcx">“The local wildlife? Have no fear. I am a Speaker. They won’t approach us so recklessly.” Serena paused and asked, “Why did you have nowhere to go? Amelia told me you were a merchant’s bookkeeper. What happened?” Some more pulses from Polina’s blessing, and the woman became silent for a long time.</p>
<p class="cnNlMGZmNzRjNTdjYTQxMDM4MGZkYWE5YzIyNjc3NjE0">“What’s my name?” Polina suddenly asked.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzBkNmFhY2YzNzRkZmU5Y2I4YjI2ODg4ZDM3ZjUz">“Huh?” Serena seemed confused by the sudden question. “Have you forgotten?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNmMzZDc5M2ZjNDQ0NjlhZGVjZTRlZTZhMTNmM2Fi">“What do <em>you</em> think my name is?”</p>
<p class="cnNlODhhMDNkNmUzYzQxYjNiYWIxYjJhNzA1N2RhZTI3">“Why-”</p>
<p class="cnMxMmRlYzQzYTU2MTRmNzI4MmIyZTY1MmM2NDBlYWEx">“Just answer!” Polina cried out, her voice carrying out a strange note of desperation.</p>
<p class="cnM3YmM2NmM5ZDhlNzQyZDhhNWNiOGZmNjRhNGY2MjUy">“... You’re Tatiana,” Serena said as Polina’s blessing activated.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTA1NWZkODk5NjRlYTRiM2NjODc0NGIzNGU5Zjlj">All was quiet for a few seconds and then Polina giggled. The sound was so unexpected both Serena and Amelia were taken back. “Pfft!” Polina giggled again, and then began laughing out loud. “Ha ha ha!” She laughed madly for a moment before settling down, breathing heavily. “Well, go on then, make it quick.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjNkOTIzNDIxZTRkN2U5MDAyNWQ2MGNiMGMzYTc5">“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OTFkZmNiNWI4ODQzNDZiZTgxMTc4MTEyNzFiYjAw">“It doesn’t matter much now, but I didn’t mean to blow the engine. Really,” Polina’s voice became firm, “I only wanted to get you.” Aside from the rustle of the treetops, silence filled the area for a dozen seconds. Amelia’s mind raced. Why had Polina given up the act now?</p>
<p class="cnM3ZThiOWM5OGQyYjRlM2ZiM2YyYmY1NzIzOTE1MTA5">“I thought you recognised me,” Serena said plainly, all veneer of compassion gone from her voice and her usual captain demeanour coming through. “Why did the lift engine detonate? Those things don’t go up easily.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NjgzMGJmZDlhNTQ1ZTQ4NDhjNDFmMjFiNzNjM2Rk">“Ha!” Polina scoffed and pushed herself up against the tree. “You bitch,” she said. “I hate your guts. Hurry up and kill me, before I try and kill you again.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMDJmZGJhNzZkZDRmZTJhOWJhYzI4MTU2ZjRhMmZh">“Yet you haven’t, which means you cannot. A lot of humans hate me, although not many try and kill me,” Serena said. “Why did Federation Intelligence try and assassinate me? Were you trying to kill Amelia as well?”</p>
<p class="cnNkZWZiYzljNWIyNTQwMmRiYTg2ZmU5ZTU3MTNkNTgw">“We didn’t try and kill you!” Polina spat on the floor. “I did! Me! Alone! Why? Does it matter!? Why don’t you kill me and finish the job!”</p>
<p class="cnMwYTIyYTY1MGVjMTRkNzNiNDhjYzY1ZmFjYmM0ZTI4">“Finish…?” Serena mumbled, seemingly unperturbed by Polina’s aggression. “Did I kill someone close to you? Ah… so it is that…” Serena leaned in. “Who was it? Who did I kill that caused all this to happen?”</p>
<p class="cnNiMTc4NzFhN2Q3NzQyOTJiMmRiMWYwNmZiNTkxMGZl">“Bitch! I’ll never tell you!” Polina seemed almost maniacal, and Amelia was teetering on a knife edge about whether to interfere. “So just kill me!”</p>
<p class="cnNhM2Y1Mzc3NGY1OTRjNGI4NGE5YzBmNDYyN2E5MWM1">“I’m not going to kill you,” Serena said flatly. Another activation of Polina’s blessing and Amelia began to assemble a theory.</p>
<p class="cnNlNWJkMGNkOTIzODQ4YWJiMGM1ZjExNDYwOTYyNWRm">“T-then, hurry up and torture me! That’s all you’re good for!”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjFjNzc2ODVjYTRmYjI5N2RlNjMxMGQyMmU4N2M5">“What nonsense you speak…” Serena mumbled, “I’m not going to torture you or hurt you. It seems I’ve already done enough. I don’t think you understand how lucky you are. I doubt anyone’s going to be killing or torturing you, even if they wanted to.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MmEyOGM2NjAyZTQ4Nzk4ZTViM2MwOWU0NDBmOWE3">Another activation. “Huh!? What…” Polina’s attitude made another radical change, now she seemed only confused. “I don’t understand…” This final change was enough to confirm Amelia’s growing suspicions.</p>
<p class="cnNmZjQxZmQ2MjQ5YzQ0NzY4ZDQ3ODgzZDg0MmRhNTYz">“I know what her blessing does!” Amelia yelled out excitedly, popping out her gigantic face around the corner. “It lets her detect truth and lies! Isn’t that right, Polina!?”</p>
<p class="cnM0OTBkYjk1YThiODRiYWNhNDM2NTg5NzcxYTFmNmRh">“Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhh!” Polina screamed.</p>
<p class="cnMyZTlkYjA2YzdkODRmZjE5YjY0MzAyYzg2NTgxMzU0">Serena just sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose while shaking her head.</p>
<p class="cnM2Yjg0YjFhMGUyNDRmMzFiMDg0NDE4YWI3NTI3MmUw">Huh, what did she do wrong!?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMyMWY1ZWRmZmMzNzQzZWViNThlNDc2MmI5NjI4Y2U3"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMyOGJlMTgzYzliYzRmNWI5MmVjNDgwYmYxN2YxOWI0">“W-w-wh-” Polina stuttered, her face drained of colour and eyes wide in fear. “Wh- what’s that!” She had scrambled backwards, pressing her body hard against the tree.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTU2YzA5NDhkNTQ5YjBhMzBlZWRhMzE0NGFiNmYz">“Har har!” Amelia bounced around the area, clambering up a tree and looking down on the shaking Polina. “It’s me! Amelia! Aren’t I cute!” Amelia dropped down and approached the pair. Serena was groaning and rubbing her forehead. Concerned that perhaps she was getting a headache, Amelia fired off another round of healing and cleaning.</p>
<p class="cnMyMWFjMTM0ZjEwMjQyZDI5ZjhmMTY0YzA4NThhYWFl">Polina’s blessing had activated when Amelia had announced her identity. Interestingly, it seemed to pass through her defences as if her wards weren’t even there. There was no blessing mechanic in the game she had played in the hospital. They seemed to work under entirely different principles compared to regular aether magic. Still, if Polina’s blessing did let her know that Amelia was telling the truth; that she was <em>especially </em>amazing and adorable in this form, then things would progress easier.</p>
<p class="cnNmYmIzNjg3ZDVmZDRmZDJhOTY4YmYwZTVhZDM4ODA3">Based on that assumption, Amelia took one, two, three, and then a fourth hand and curled each of them into feathery thumbs-up. With her quadruple thumbs-up prepared, she thrust them towards Polina and, with a friendly smile, chirped, “Amelia! Your friend, remember!?”</p>
<p class="cnNjMzhmYTQxODEzODQ1NWY4ZmEyY2I2N2ZhNGI4Y2Iy">“A-Amelia!? I-is that really you?"</p>
<p class="cnM2N2M3NzY4ZDlkZDQ1NzRiMTdmOWY1MjI3MTRlYzMw">“Mmm!” Amelia affirmed, producing a sound halfway between her usual self and an alien growl.</p>
<p class="cnM0MGFhZDYyN2YwZjRjOTk5NDJjZGM0Y2M3ZjlhZDQw">“How did…” Polina shook her head as if trying to dispel an illusion. Unfortunately for her, Amelia’s greatness was no illusion! “What happened to you!?” Polina finally spluttered.</p>
<p class="cnNkMTVjNzIyM2VjMDQ3ZDg4OTJlMjIyNmE5NWEwZmZm">“I Spoke the Second Word!” Amelia said, grinning. “And then I became like this! Feel how soft my fur is!” She moved and thrust an arm in front of Polina’s face, turned so the underside of the forearm, with the pure white fur, was facing her.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWQ5NTZjODE5MDRlMGJiMjU2YzI5ZDZjNmVhNjhk">“Wh-” Polina began.</p>
<p class="cnNhMGQ5NGZjZWQ5OTRjOTc4ODhkN2Y2NGEzZjg0MTg5">“Feel it!” Amelia said with a bit more force. Polina swallowed and hesitantly reached out and touched Amelia’s arm. “Doesn’t it feel amazing! I was thinking I could lop off an arm and then make a blanket from my skin! Is that- is that weird? I think it’s weird, but imagine how much it would sell for! It would be so-”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDkzODc4MzEwYjQwNjliZDVmODZjYjYzNzczNTQ4">“<em>If we could,</em>” Serena interrupted her rambling. “We’re moving off-topic.” Serena gave her a look that was somewhere between an eye roll and a stern glare.</p>
<p class="cnM2N2NhNDBhYzUwZDQ0ZDU4YmMzN2YwNWJiMGRmYjg0">“Ah…” Amelia mumbled. Something about this form made her act a little weird. She would try and keep it down for now. She backed off a few steps, but was happy to see Polina kept looking at her. No doubt she was awestruck by her white fur and shimmering black wings!</p>
<p class="cnMwOTBhM2ExZjZkYjRhOGU5Yjg0OGRiNTkzZmI1MjZk">“Polina,” Serena said, turning her gaze upon the nervous woman. Eventually, Polina was able to break her eyes away from Amelia and turn them towards Serena. “Is what Amelia said true? Your blessing can distinguish truth from lies?”</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2YyZTc4MGI0MzQ2NWY5MWM0MTdjY2EzNTE1ZDIz">Polina was silent for a long time before looking down and softly muttering, “Yes…”</p>
<p class="cnMzMWYzZmI5MzUxNDQ4MzU4OGE5MjUwZjY5YzMwZjdh">“Prove it!” Serena demanded, crossing her arms.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDFkYTkyN2QxMjQ1ZmY5NWFjNGVkOTk5OWY1NTFj">“H-how!?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjhjOWM1ZGFiYTQwZDk4M2JhYWQ4OWIxZTUyZTk2">“I’ll make a series of statements. Tell me if they’re true or not. I-”</p>
<p class="cnMwMGJiOTFhOGE2YzQ4ODVhNGI1YTVkMTdiYTBmYTE4">“Oh! Me, me!” Amelia interrupted, patting her hands on the floor excitedly. “I bet Federation Intelligence already knows all about you! They won’t know about me!” Serena opened her mouth and looked as if she was about to chastise her, but instead, she hesitated. A moment later, she nodded at Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnMxZGNjYzE3ZWIxNzRiYThiMGM1ZWRjZTI4YzdjYTE0">“Fine, but don’t give anything important away.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMWMyNGVhYTgyOTRiODZhZmEzMWI4ODcwY2M2YTg4">“Okay! Okay!” Amelia’s mind raced. “Polina, did you know I used to smoke when I was younger?” As her sentence finished, a now-familiar ripple propagated out of Polina, bouncing off Amelia and returning to Polina’s soul.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTc2N2E0NDYyNTQ1ODNhYjFjNDk5YmVkMmY5Y2Jl">“I-it’s not true…” Polina muttered.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDM3MGRlMjQzMDQ2ZTlhY2ZhYzY4YzliNzZlYWUy">“Correct! Another one! I once helped catch a bunch of sardis using magic!” After Polina’s blessing finished, the woman correctly determined it was true. Amelia fired off another series of claims, some true and some lies.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTg0MzYyMjM0NDRkYzZhNjdlMzdhNDk0NDYxNzM2">“I’ve never broken a bone!”</p>
<p class="cnM3N2JjOWQyYTViMDRhZjhhMTFlYzY4MGQ5NmJlNzcw">“Water is my favourite drink!”</p>
<p class="cnMyZDJlMDE0NWExMTQyNjc4ZjU0OWI3OTM3MmUzY2M2">“I once ran a marathon!”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDIwZTllNmRlMDRlMjM5NWFjYjNlNmVmODllMTAw">“I once slept for three days!”</p>
<p class="cnMwODNmZmQwZmVkODQzNzI5YjA5NTJkMjBjMzhhZjJm">Polina correctly identified all four claims, even if she mumbled about not knowing what a marathon was. Serena looked like she was about to step in, but Amelia had one more trick up her sleeve.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmIyZmYyZTM3NjQwMDRiNGQwODBjZmNjYWI0ZTI2">“One more! I am <em>utterly</em> and <em>hopelessly</em>, down to the deepest depths of my heart, <em>in love with someone!</em>” Amelia giggled as Polina’s face took on an expression of shock, and the faintest squeak came from Serena, so quiet that only Amelia could have heard it.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTRiYjUyODVjYTQxZDA5M2U1NDRiNTJhMzFjOTRi">She was certain Serena would make her pay for that later, but that was alright. Serena’s ‘punishments’ were actually rather enjoyable! Her girlfriend was a total softy, wasn’t she?</p>
<p class="cnM4MzlkMzZjOTdlNDQyMGI4M2VhN2U0ZGY4NzY3Njc3">“It’s… it’s true…” Polina said quietly.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDBlZTQzZGIwNDQ2NzRiMzNkYWExYTNkZGQ4MDZm">“<em>Enough</em> of this,” Serena declared, positioning herself so her face was turned away from Amelia. “You’re a <em>truth-teller</em>,” she said to Polina. “That’s one in a million! Probably even rarer. I’ve only known three human truth-tellers in <em>history,</em> and they all belong to the church! Why in the seven hells would Federation Intelligence risk you?”</p>
<p class="cnNmZDJiNTE5NmRjMDQ1NjM5ZDZkMWY5YjNkZThkMTQ3">“B-b-” Polina stuttered, “because of you!” She pointed at Serena. “And you!” She pointed at Amelia. “Everyone knows about her healing! It makes no sense! Where did she come from!? Is Amelia really a Speaker, working for… for <em>you!?</em>” Polina began breathing heavily and was rubbing her hair. Amelia sent out another wave of healing that seemed to help Polina’s nerves.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzRhZGEwNjcyNDQ4YTVhYjFkNDU2ZDZjNWVlYjVi">“How much does Federation Intelligence know about Amelia?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnNlZGJlZTI4YWZhYTQxOTdiNGNhODE2NDkzODg1ZWEz">“I… I’m not telling you! You can torture me all you like; I’m not saying anything! Not to you!”</p>
<p class="cnMyN2ZhNmRjNTVhNTRkMWQ4OTBhNTkzMDBmNTc1ZGJh">“Silly girl,” Serena said, shaking her head. “Didn’t I tell you? No one is going to be hurting you. Most of all because <em>this idiot</em>…” She jabbed her thumb sideways at Amelia, who decided to nod enthusiastically in turn. “... has taken a liking to you. Even without that, the fact you’re a <em>truth-teller</em> makes you one of the most valuable hostages we could ever have. You’ll probably be treated like a damn Highlord in Cascadian custody, at least until we ransom you for the price of a small kingdom!</p>
<p class="cnNiOWQ2NDU3NTkzZDQ4ZjA4MDRkZGU5Nzk2NTA5NTY0">“However,” Serena continued, leaning in. “We’ve forgotten a <em>crucial</em><em> </em>topic. You see, I am <em>not</em> like those heretics who slaughtered their way through Greatlord Orlan’s territory. I am <em>not</em> like the Republican fanatics deluded by the teachings of the human church and their lies. And I am <em>not</em>,” Serena’s voice took on a cold tone, “like the berserkers from the Endless Sands, which <em>your</em> Federation helps transport to the battlefield, where they kill and harvest our horns like cattle!” Serena’s knuckles turned white as she squeezed her fists. “So, <em>who</em> did I kill that caused this!?”</p><span class="cjdjNGVmY2VkMjUxMDRlYzY5MzEyM2YxYzhjZmFhYWNm"><br/>This book's true home is on another platform. Check it out there for the real experience.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkYTZmYjhjOTg2MDRmZTFiOTU2NWM0NDI4ZDZjM2Fj">“... I won’t say!”</p>
<p class="cnMyYmYxNDNkZDBiMjQxN2NiOGQ1OGM1NGQ2YzdmYjJj">“Tell me!” Serena snapped, her voice taking on an odd emotion that Amelia couldn’t quite identify. There was anger in her voice but also a touch of sadness.</p>
<p class="cnM4NTY4YWVjMjljNzRiZjE4MGNkNGZmYTQyMTdhNjU1">“It… it was the convoy!” Polina spat out the words, her voice taking on a hard edge. “You remember? Back in forty-two? What <em>you</em> and <em>that ship</em> did!? All those civilian vessels!”</p>
<p class="cnM5Mjc3NDZkOWI0NTQ0MzdiMWRmZTI4M2U0NWZjZmYx">What was Polina talking about? Amelia turned to look at Serena, expecting to see her angry. Instead, her face had lost its snarl and taken on an expression of <em>guilt - </em>an appearance Amelia had never seen before. She wanted to say something, but the words wouldn’t form.</p>
<p class="cnM2NGNjYzc4MGZmYjRmYjU4ZGVkZjRhNTY4MmY4M2Rm">“That… was an accident,” Serena said after a moment of hesitation. “There was a joint Cascadian-Federation investigation. It was determined it wasn’t intentional. Surely-”</p>
<p class="cnNkMWU0NWNmNjE2NTQzMGE5MjkwMGRhZmVhMzA5N2Jj">“Pah!” Polina sniggered. “Is that how easy it is for you? ‘<em>It was determined it wasn’t intentional’</em>, and then you carry on like before? <em>It doesn’t matter!</em> So, many families! So much taken! Give it back! Give back what you took from me! Gi-” Polina’s voice choked up as she was overwhelmed by emotion. She curled into a ball, burying her head into her knees, sobbing. “Give it back… give it back to me…”</p>
<p class="cnM1NzNiOTZmZTU2NzQ4NmRiMTIwNjU4MjYyMmQxZWRm">For the first time Amelia had ever seen, Serena looked like she didn’t know what to do. Usually, her girlfriend maintained a presence that she <em>belonged</em> wherever she was and was comfortable in any situation. This situation, however, was something else entirely.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjJlYTcwYzgwZjRjNzI4OGExMzhmZjEwN2UwYTU4">Amelia would have to ask Serena about what event Polina was talking about later. However, now was not the time. Even she could see that.</p>
<p class="cnM3NWIzZTAxZWJmYTQ5ZWJiYmNjMmE2NTE5NWFjMzBj">She motioned with one enormous hand for Serena to back off. Her demon girlfriend looked at her with a complicated expression before clicking her tongue and turning around before walking away. Amelia turned back to the sobbing Polina and adjusted her body so she was sitting like a cat, with her head resting on her two front arms and the other pair tucked underneath. She stretched her wings around the area to form a little enclosure for just her and Polina.</p>
<p class="cnM0MWViNzY3ZjgxZDQzYzQ5Yjg0MDlhNmE2ZWY5NDM0">Amelia felt sad as she saw her friend struggling so much. “I’m really sorry about whatever happened to you.” She began, mentally slapping herself for not coming up with anything better. “It’s not fair for you to suffer like this. I won’t let anyone hurt you any more, alright Polina?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZTcxZDYwZDg4MjRkZTM5MjIwZTk0NjQxMWZhNDA3">“H-how can you stay with her…” Polina muttered. “She’s… she’s…”</p>
<p class="cnM3MTFjMGUyYTYyYzRkOWU4OGI1MGY5NGMwYjgyMWZj">“Because <em>I love her</em>,” Amelia whispered as quietly as her form allowed her. Polina half laughed and half snorted, the sound of it weird and wet from her tears and her emotion. “She also loves me…” Amelia finished.</p>
<p class="cnMwZTQ1OTg5YjFkYjRiN2FhODcxYzI2NzQ4ZTg3MzQ3">“Why…” Polina said softly, looking at the ground. “She doesn’t <em>deserve</em> anyone’s love…”</p>
<p class="cnMyZjg0Y2NiM2JjZjQ3NDU4OGM3YmM4YTUwODFkYjk4">“That’s not true,” Amelia said, shaking her feathered head, causing a rustling sound to echo throughout the area. “She might not deserve your kindness, but she deserves <em>mine</em>. It is mine to give, and I choose to give it to her. I’m sorry, it might not be what you want to hear, but it’s the truth.” Amelia swallowed awkwardly, the sound loud in the otherwise quiet environment. “I won’t say you’re wrong for wanting vengeance, but I can’t let her die. She means too much to me.”</p>
<p class="cnM4YmZhZmUzOTc4NzQ5ZjZiMmZkMzNhODkyMzY2NDU4">Polina sniffed, wiping her running nose before muttering, “I must be the unluckiest person ever…”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDI2MDMwZGZkNTQ2M2U4NTg3MTgzZWQwZTgzMDgx">“Life’s a bitch, isn’t it?” Amelia said, putting on a smile. Polina gave a weak laugh.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTYxNzE2NzE4ZTQ4ODhhZGZlMzY5ODc4Mjg5NTUz">“Yeah… it really is….”</p>
<p class="cnM4MmIwMmYyN2M1NjQzNWY5NWNjM2UxYmFlYTNkOWM3">A few seconds pass of heavy silence. “Polina,” Amelia said when she thought the time felt right.</p>
<p class="cnM1NGIwOWYzZDZiZDRiM2RhMzg5YWFhNTkxZDc1NzA0">“What?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTk5NDA0YjBkOTRjMWU4ZmMxNmI3YjExZTc5OWMz">“What’s your second blessing?” Amelia expected Polina to stutter or react with surprise, but she simply stared back at her.</p>
<p class="cnM2OTE4YWVhZDAyMTRmY2Q4NDg1ZGRjN2E5M2QyMDUw">“... How do you know?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNjhkMmJiMWY0NTRmYTY4ZGJiMTJiNGY3Y2Q5NGJh">“I can see them on your soul,” Amelia said, punctuating her words with a thrust of her head. “I can see your truth-telling one activate in response to things people say. What’s the other one? Don’t worry, even if it’s bad I won’t let anyone hurt you.” She didn’t know how much Polina cared about her protection, but her blessing should let her know Amelia was serious.</p>
<p class="cnM5MmNjNTdkYjVjYjQ2MzRhZmM2YWI1ZTEyOTU1YWEw">“It…” Polina began before closing her mouth as she struggled to find the words. “I can make moon crystals unstable. I can <em>undo</em> them, causing them to…” She motioned an explosion with her hands. “... Blow up.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MThlYTI3N2ExOTQ1MmQ5YmYyMGY5NDk0MTFlYTUy">Ah, another piece of the puzzle fell into place. That explained why the ship blew up like it did. It wasn’t that there was a bomb in the kitchen; instead, Polina had detonated the crystal fuel powering the kitchen ovens. “So, you used it to blow the ship up?” Amelia asked, seeking clarification.</p>
<p class="cnNlNGQ1Zjg4ZTI1OTQxZTlhYjk0ZTA4ZmIzNzVjNGQ4">“N-not on purpose! I was…” Polina broke eye contact, looking at the floor again. “I was looking for fuel I could use to target… target Serena.” Her eyes flicked to Amelia before darting back down again. “But I got caught in the engine room and while I was trying to figure out what to do, she just <em>appeared</em> and I lost control! I didn’t mean it!” Polina began to choke up again. “I didn’t mean to kill everyone…”</p>
<p class="cnM1M2E3ZTg4NWMzNjRjNjQ4YjBjMzA3NmMzN2Y5NzIz">“Hmm…” Amelia scratched her neck with a talon. “You’re lucky I was there. I was able to put everyone back together.” Seeing Polina’s eyes widen, she couldn’t help but give her another cheerful thumbs-up. At least she could provide some good news. “Yeah, my healing’s super amazing! I put you back together as well! I think everyone survived!”</p>
<p class="cnMxNzA2NWZkMjIyMTQwMjNhMzM1ZjUzOGE3ZWY2YmQ4">“B-b-but…” Polina stuttered. “You can’t just <em>put</em> someone back together! You can’t bring back the dead! No-one can! Not even the Pope!”</p>
<p class="cnM5Mjg2MTIyZWQzYjQ5YmE5MzczNzJhNTkwZjExNjY1">“Hmm…” Amelia thought back to the previous events. Despite her losing herself in the initial transformation, she remembered every detail perfectly. “I don’t think people were really dead. Sure, many of their bodies were broken, but I could see their souls still hanging about. They were slowly vanishing, into the mists I think, and if I were even ten seconds late then I wouldn’t have been able to do anything but…” Amelia shrugged, ruffling her feathered neck. “When I poured out my healing power, everyone’s bodies reformed and the souls sort of… reattached. I don’t think I <em>resurrected</em> anyone, it was more like… I fixed things before the soul realised the body had died.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMzM4MjI2M2U4NDQ0OThiZTk1NTk5MDJiZDJmMWQ0">“... That’s incredible.” Polina looked genuinely in awe this time, which made Amelia buzz with happiness. “So I didn’t kill anyone?”</p>
<p class="cnMxNDU1MjRkYjJkYjQ1MDY5MmEyNTQzYzA1NmRhYTJk">“Nope!” Amelia exaggeratedly shook her head. “I knew you weren’t evil!”</p>
<p class="cnNkOWQ0MzdmODc2YTQ5ODI5NmE5Nzc4ZjZmNGFlNGM0">“… thank you…” Polina said before adding, “...thank you for saving my life…”</p>
<p class="cnM4YmUwYTRhMjY2ZDQzODhiM2JkMjA5ODg3NDA1Mzgw">“Mmm! You’re welcome!” Amelia said with a grin to which Polina responded with a weak smile. Their conversation died, but they seemed happy to sit in reflective silence for a few minutes. Amelia thought about closing her eyes and napping when Polina suddenly piped up.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjFhZjE4ZTI3ODQzNDg4Mjc1Mzk4NTFiNWIxNWMz">“Hang on, what about everyone else? Where are they?”</p>
<p class="cnNkZTIxMzZhN2EyNTQ2ZjViNzZlOGI4YmU0YTY4YWE2">“Oh! They’re on the ship. I put everyone to sleep, thought it would make things easier.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjBmMGEyZWE4MzQ1YmI4NmQ4MTZjMDZmMzMyYjY5">“Right…” Polina sighed. “So what now? Are we just going to sit around waiting to be rescued?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OGM3ZDc1OTVhZjQ0MTM4MDcwMDUzMDVkMzBkMzNl">“I guess so!” Amelia chirped. “We’ll probably move everyone onto the rescue ship and then continue sailing to Shimashina!”</p>
<p class="cnNmOTE0NzJiMjNkMDRhNjg4ZjIzMzlhNjUzZDgxY2Jh">“We most certainly <em>will not</em>,” came a stern voice from the outside. Amelia lifted a wing to see Serena standing there with her arms crossed and a firm expression.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTFlYmViN2EwMTRhZWU4M2RhY2I1NDI4NWJkMmQ3">“Huh?” Amelia started. “We’re not?”</p>
<p class="cnNkYjNhMGNkZDUxMzQyMzU5N2MxZTM3YTJhNjc0NjUx">“<em>If</em> she’s telling the truth about her second blessing, then she absolutely cannot be allowed to travel on <em>any</em> ship,” Serena stated firmly. “Whether it was an <em>accident</em> or not, there is nothing stopping it from happening again.” Serena kicked about the ground for a moment before pulling up a small clump that glowed softly in Amelia’s eyes. Serena rubbed most of the dirt off the unrefined crystal before chucking it on the ground a few meters away.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmQzNDE4MmMyNzQyOGJhY2ZhYmIxOGY1ODBkYTcx">“Go on then,” Serena said, gesturing to the crystal. “Prove this blessing of yours.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMDlhNTFjNDFiZTRhZTFhNGQ2MjU5YzdjZTM1MDJl">Polina swallowed. She locked eyes with the crystal and began to focus. Amelia stared at Polina’s soul, where the second blessing began wriggling excitedly. A moment later, a tendril shot out, connecting with the crystal on the floor. The tendril pulsed and the aetherfield around the crystal suddenly distorted wildly.</p>
<p class="cnM3NmU4NjQyYjA3YTRkMDBiYWZhY2I2MmQ0OGY3MDky">The crystal blew up with a sharp explosion similar to a gunshot. The sound echoed in the dark forest. The three of them were silent. Eventually, Serena dug around for another crystal, throwing it about twenty meters away from Polina, who shook her head. “I can’t do it that far. About a dozen meters is the best I can do.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NzMxYzNhMjIwMTRhZGFhOWFmYjdkNmNjMGM1OTcz">“How many times?” Serena asked.</p>
<p class="cnNjNDU2NmRjZTA4ODQ5YmZhM2MwNzY1NTQ1MzUzOWNl">“Depends on the distance and size, but… not many. It’s exhausting to use.”</p>
<p class="cnNiZjNiZDg1ZGFjNDQ4ZTdhOTcyY2ZiOTRiZWM4Yzc2">Serena nodded. “What a terrifying blessing. Do you know what god blessed you?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YjE0NDllY2I4NTQ1NmI5NDFhNjA3NTViMjQ0ZjNm">“Umm…” Polina hesitated. “No… I’ve kept it secret. Even the Federation only knows about my truth-telling one.” Serena glanced at Amelia with a look that said <em>don’t tell her anything</em>. Amelia cast a look back in agreement. Polina struggled with demons enough as it was. If she were to find out a demon god had <em>blessed</em> her, it might drive the poor woman to have another accident.</p>
<p class="cnNiODhiOTU3ZWY5ZDQ0MGZhZjA0NGEwMjRmYWNjYWIz">“Then… what do we do? If we can’t put her on a ship, how will we get to Shimashina?” Amelia asked, cocking her head to the side. Surely they weren’t going to <em>walk</em> hundreds of kilometres through the forest? If it were just her and Serena, they could run at an enhanced speed and get there in a few hours, but with Polina, it meant they had to go at her pace.</p>
<p class="cnMwMTM2M2Y0YjM4ODRjNWFhMTQ0ZTQ5MDFmYTUyYjU2">“Well…” Serena said while casting a side-eye at Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTRjMTNlYzExYTRjYTliNDA1MmYzZmUyOGQ5YWU5">“What?”</p>
<p class="cnMzNWQzNDk2YzkyODQ4Njk4MGMyYzM1ODU2Yjg3NzI5">“You <em>do</em> have wings, don’t you?”</p>

      <description>Chapter Thirty-Five: Little Big Horns</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM0YjU3OWRjZGQ0ZTQ3MjU5NjZkMTVlYjc1N2I4MTU3"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMwMjBkYzNkYjg1ZjQ3OWQ5NzJlZjdjMTYzODJiNTE3">Wings! She did have wings! Amelia couldn’t contain her growing excitement and leapt up, bouncing around the area, giggling uncontrollably. “You mean it!?” she asked Serena as she stopped and began <em>tippy-tapping</em> the floor with her four hands. “We’re going to fly to Shimashina!? You’re going to <em>ride</em> me!?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNWZjYmZlMWIwMjRmMDJhZGJhMTcwNGY5NDlkOGI4">“Ha!” Serena exclaimed, looking amused at Amelia’s antics. “Not quite. We’ll fly within fifty klicks of the city and enter the forest before the perimeter ships and their aetherscopes can pick you up. Then you’ll transform back, and we'll run the final leg. We-” Serena frowned. “Hang on.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOWY4YjRhMzI5ODRhYTFiYTY2YWY1NGU0ZWE4ZWE4">She vanished into the ship, where Amelia could sense her collecting their luggage. While that was happening, a small voice piped up.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzQwNmQ1NDFmYTQzYzk5MjU5NzI2ZTg1ZDRjOTBi">“We’re really going to… fly?” Polina asked in a small voice.</p>
<p class="cnM5N2M1NmIyN2FkNTQ1M2Y5MmEwMmVjMDQzNWE4Mjc1">Amelia flashed a gigantic smile. “Looks like it! Don’t worry, I’ll ward you so if anything goes wrong you’ll be unharmed!” At her words, Polina’s eyes widened and a small smile appeared on her face.</p>
<p class="cnNlYWZmNzNjN2Y0OTQ3MjU5MzUwZjQ2ZTI1NGE1NTNh">“Ward me? Of course, you can do something like that…” she muttered. “How can you Speak the Second Word? It should be impossible. You’re <em>twenty-five</em>! Unless…” Suddenly, Polina looked apprehensive. “Are you a darkblade!?” she blurted out.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzBlNzliNzk2MDQ2OGRiNjJmZGYxZmIwNDk4MTBj">“Nope!” Amelia chirped, waiting for Polina’s blessing to verify her statement before continuing, “I’m just me! Amelia!” She punctuated her point using two of her four hands to point to herself.</p>
<p class="cnNjMWUyYWUzZDAyMDQ4NzlhZTc1ZjA3OTFiZjAwZmY2">Polina mumbled some more stuff about impossible things as she twiddled her fingers. Amelia let her be, turning back to the ship as Serena appeared with their luggage and a large rope.</p>
<p class="cnNmMmY0OWY1MDM3YTQxYzA4NDBjZGJhMTg5Y2NlZTc3">“Our stuff. I figured we might as well bring it. After all, when you change back…” Serena looked Amelia up and down, “... you’ll be naked. Can’t have you strolling into Shimashina wearing nothing, can we?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMzliMmYzNjczNzQxMWNhOGQxZTVmZmQ5YmIxYTlj">“Hehe…” Amelia giggled.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2I4ODVhYWYyNzQwMmI4Mzg0ZWMyOGRhYTdhNDhm">“We’ll wrap the luggage in this rope,” Serena said, holding the thick rope up. “You can hold it in one of your hands. You’ll need to be careful not to crush it accidentally. Look at what those wings and talons have done to the tree bark!” Serena pointed, and Amelia followed her finger to see the deep scratches and cuts in the enormous trees surrounding them.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTM4MGJhNzFmNzRmN2U4MzAwNjU2M2E3MGI3MDFm">“It’s just tree bark, right?” Amelia asked, raising a taloned hand and carving into a nearby tree. She barely felt any resistance.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzdlZTBjNzdhMDQ5N2U4ZTIxNjNkNzM5ZTNmOWEy">“That <em>bark</em> is two inches thick and almost as tough as iron,” Serena intoned. “In emergencies, ships have been known to land and harvest it for repairs and armour! Be careful with your hands! You’ll slice someone in half if you’re not careful!”</p>
<p class="cnNjN2NjN2VlYWU5NjRlMDc4MjFhM2RjNDhjMjMxM2Rh">“Ahh…” Amelia gulped and made a mental note to always pay attention to where her hands were. “I see…”</p>
<p class="cnM1NmQ1NjhiNWRlMjQ0NzA5OWUyODQ2YmNmYzMyODdm">“I’ll find another rope to make some kind of harness for me and <em>that girl</em>,” Serena jerked her head towards Polina, who shrank back a little. Serena couldn’t keep the distaste out of her voice. “It would be best to put her to sleep for the journey. Because-” Amelia’s aether flared, and a moment later Polina fell to her side, under the effects of Amelia’s sleep spell.</p>
<p class="cnM4YmYwNDJhZWFiMjQwMmZhOWIwODE4ZWY3OWFiZjRj">Serena’s eyes widened in surprise. “That was easy; I thought you would be against the idea…”</p>
<p class="cnMxZWEyYTY4YTBlYjQ2ODViMTAwZThlZTMwOWNiOWMy">“It’s not that,” Amelia said quickly, focusing almost entirely on the aetherfield as her instincts screamed at her. “Something's coming, something big. Fifty kilometres... closing fast.” As the entity approached, Amelia cast an eighth-circle ward on Polina and then an enormous sixth-circle ward covering the entire ship and its unconscious inhabitants.</p>
<p class="cnNiMWZhZmMwZjQ4ZDQ3NjBiMDlhZTY2MzllOWNjZjQx">So many wards were a strain on even Amelia’s titanic aether reserves. Her regeneration - which she now understood to be a result of how her soul bent the aetherfield into her, similar to how a planet bent space-time - was struggling to keep up. Amelia cancelled the ward she had cast around the trio earlier, stabilising her aether.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjI4YTY3ZWMzNTQ4YjNiMGVmNzNiMDNhNDdlMDg1">Still, it made her oddly anxious for her maintenance costs to more or less match her regeneration. The tiers of spells accessible from the Second Word, the seventh, eighth and the monstrous <em>ninth</em>-tier were no joke. They were exponentially more expensive than the lower tiers. This was the first time she had begun to sense the precise limit of her powers. Of course, she still had numerous buffs she could cast upon herself to increase her capabilities, although she had zero experience using them in the real world.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjc4MTQwZjQ4MDRiNDdhMTM1YWY4MTYzYWYxZDU4">If it came to a fight, then hopefully everything worked like it did from the game.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDA4NmFkMzE4ZDQ5ODU4NzhlYjA1MzRiODliM2Ri">The wind began to pick up as the entity approached. First, it was just the whisper of wind, the slight rustle of the forest canopy and the gentle ruffling of her feathers. Then it picked up, and the branches began to creak under the growing wind, and leaves began to fall. Serena seemed to sense it now as well, and moved closer to Amelia, her hand gripping her training sword.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzcyNjdhNDI1MTQ5NjU5MWJjZmNlNjA0Nzk2MzMz">As it closed in on them, the wind became a storm, and thunder sounded from close by. The air hummed with electricity, and her feathers and fur rose. Small branches snapped off and fell, carpeting the mostly barren floor with a carpet of greenery.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTljYzgzMDIyMzRhOWRhNGU2MmE2MGVmNzY3MjNh">Then, it breached the forest canopy.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjYyNzJkYzBjNDQ0MTNhMTI3MDIyZWJhNDNjZGMw">It was a giant humanoid <em>thing</em>. It didn’t seem to have a physical form. Instead, its outline was subtly defined by the flow of wind around its location - its body vaguely represented where the leaves and dirt struggled to pass through. As it floated down, nearby leaves and branches were entirely vapourised by the arcs of electricity firing off the giant’s body.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGY3ODliOWQ3MjQxYWQ5ZDgxNjJmM2VmMTkyNWFk">It landed about fifty meters away from them and simply <em>watched</em> them. At least, Amelia thought it was watching them. She could only barely make out its facial features. Looking at it with her newly gained perception, she suspected that this entity mostly existed in the mirror realm she had identified, and only a small portion of it was manifested in this plane. The power of its soul was almost blinding to her eyes and made it somewhat uncomfortable to look directly at.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjQxNWZkOWYyNzRjY2JiMGMxM2IwYWMyZGIyNTA4">He was also enormous. Perhaps twenty-five meters tall. If Amelia stood upright then maybe she would be taller, at least if it weren’t for the great horns of shadow that crowned the figure's head. Amelia swallowed nervously, and then slowly raised one of her four arms and gave a small wave to the familiar entity.</p>
<p class="cnNjMmQwYzBiZjZlOTQxODlhYjk0N2Y5YzcwOWJkMTg0">“Hello again,” she said to the eastern overlord.</p>
<p class="cnNjNmRhNzNjYTBmYzQzYjlhNjM0NGYxYjk2NzUzODY2">The overlord was silent for an awkward amount of time that stretched to the point Amelia considered speaking again. Thankfully, he broke the silence first.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDk3YWMwYzA3MTRkNzdiODk0MjUyMDMxMTM1ZGE3">“You again,” intoned the overlord, the act of just speaking sending bolts of lightning that vaporised parts of tree bark, leaving oddly-shaped holes behind. Amelia couldn’t help but suspect that perhaps this was why he landed away from them. “The first violation in Kenhoro, and now… <em>this</em>.” He hissed the last word, and a stream of lightning crackled wildly as it ate away at the surrounding trees.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzZjZGRkYzJhMzQzNmM5Y2NkNjUzYThmODY3ZTRm">“I-” Amelia began to explain.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzg4NmVmODNlYTQ4YjRhYmRlMjMyMzYwM2I0NjUw">“<em>Asclepius,”</em> interrupted the overlord. “Why did you accept the connection? Is your thirst for knowledge regarding this woman so great that you’ll violate the accords?”</p>
<p class="cnMwZDBhNzY4MTRhMTQ2ZGJhYjQ3NTc3ZmI1OWY3NmU2">“Vikram!” Amelia spluttered, her mouth moving on its own. It was <em>Asclepius</em>, speaking through her. “This daemon lord forced the connection! I couldst not break it!”</p>
<p class="cnMzMjEwOGQwOWY5YjRkZGE5OWM5ODllNzE4OGU2NTIx">It felt odd to have a literal god complain about her through her own body. Besides, what was she supposed to do? Who knows how much damage she might have done if she had Spoken the Second Word of one of the more powerful demon gods who specialised in combat?</p>
<p class="cnNhNGIxMjAxYjE5ZDQ4MWViOWJmMjQyY2MzNzZjMzY0">“Every fleet in the east was scrambled because of… <em>this</em> <em>event</em>.” Vikram waved an almost invisible hand dismissively. “I thought it was an <em>attack</em>. Miss Thornheart, do you know how much <em>financial expenditure</em> you just cost me?”</p>
<p class="cnMwOGI0MTgyMmRjMTQwYmFhNjJmYzg4MGUzZjJiOTRl">“Umm…” Amelia mumbled, taking back control of her mouth.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTMxNzVkNGYzYTRjMjM4MDZmZGE4ZmZlZmRiZjE2">“Furthermore, to Speak with such power <em>this far south</em>. You’ll have disturbed <em>Rhaknam’s </em>slumber! Another mess that you have caused that others will need to clean up!” The storm giant glared at her. He seemed to be waiting for a reply, but the moment Amelia opened her mouth to apologise, he began chastising her again. “And your <em>presence</em> here! Disrupting the ecosystem! Every trade post or mining village in two hundred klicks will need deployments of soldiers to defend against the hordes of monsters fleeing <em>you</em>!”</p><span class="cjZiZWIwYWZkYzg2YTRkNDNhNzIzNzI1MjliNzMyNDMw"><br/>Love this novel? Read it on Royal Road to ensure the author gets credit.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM0MDJhYzE2ZTc3ODQ5YzBiZDU0OWMzNzgxMzg4YjI0">After he finished, Amelia waited an extra long time to make sure he was done. “I’m sorry!” she blurted out quickly, getting the words out before any potential interruption could come. “I didn’t know!”</p>
<p class="cnNkMTc2OTY5OWZjMDRmY2M4ZWIyNDkyZGVmMWM3YmM4">“Exactly,” said the overlord, “you <em>didn’t</em> know.” The giant turned its head to look down. “Young Speaker Halen, you have done a poor job of teaching this realm-traveler how to conduct herself!”</p>
<p class="cnNmODhiODRkNmFiZjQwNDI5MzAwNGY0MGUyMGQ4ZmYz">“I…” Serena began, and Amelia looked down to see Serena was on her knees, bowing with her head touching the ground. “My deepest apologies, Great One!” Seeing Serena in such a state was a shock to Amelia. It was a position of submission that she would never have been able to imagine her girlfriend taking. The sight of it tickled her anger.</p>
<p class="cnNjMmMwNzk5MWI5MTQ4M2U5YWQzZmM1YzFmNjI3Mzgz">“And this <em>human</em> with two blessings. What an unbelievable thing you have found...” The overlord’s attention turned to the sleeping Polina, his voice taking on a tone of curiosity. “Explain everything to me.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZGEyODFlZmRiNzRiOGI5NzI1MDc1YjcxMTU5ZTU1">“Well, it-” Amelia began.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDkwNmZhZjFjMTQxMjZhOWI5Y2U0ZGUzNjUwYWEw">“Not <em>you</em>,” snapped the overlord. “Speaker Halen will explain!”</p>
<p class="cnNmOThjMGZlNTBmZTQ5ZjBhODk4ZjFkY2JhOWY5MmEw">Well, alright then! Amelia decided she didn’t really like this grumpy overlord. Always interrupting her and snapping at this and that. How much would a smile cost him? Wouldn’t it pay for him to be a little more… relaxed?</p>
<p class="cnNkN2EyNGQ4ZmYwMDRlM2FiNWRjNWVkOTllZjljNmEy">Amelia resisted the urge to roll her eyes and waited quietly while Serena explained who Polina was and the events that lead up to the ship breaking. She didn’t hold anything back, and explained in detail what Polina’s blessings were. On occasion, the overlord would interrupt with a probing question or other enquiry. When they were done a full minute of silence passed before the overlord spoke.</p>
<p class="cnM0NmE4MGJhNjNmYjQwMDI5MDkxYzNhNjRhYjdlMTM0">“Perhaps something can be salvaged from this situation…” the overlord murmured. “Continue as you planned towards Shimashina. The quicker you leave the forest the better. Fly mid-sky, for if you travel too close to the canopy you’ll frighten the monsters.” The storm giant seemed to ponder for a moment before continuing. “Leave the human girl. I will take her.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NjZhMWFmNDk2ZTQ4NjE5ZDdkNWM2Zjc5ZDYyYzk5">“Hang on a minute,” Amelia began, “I-”</p>
<p class="cnNhNDk2NDA1ZDVlMTQyMTI5ODAyNTU0YTM0MzcxNjhh">“<em>Amelia!”</em> Serena hissed at her. <em>“Don’t! Not this time!”</em> Amelia looked into Serena’s hard eyes and saw a layer of fear and perhaps even anger. It was a look she had never shown before, and the fact that it was because of the overlord made Amelia dislike him even more.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTA4MDljN2M3MzQyNDliNmMzMDEwNzMyNjNkYmY0">“... fine,” she muttered, turning her head to the side.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzgyYWM2YzhiZDRiN2U5NTZkZjAzNDM1Y2QxOTE2">“Speaker Halen. Despite the <em>circumstances</em>, you’ve done well collecting me this <em>prize</em>-” Amelia felt herself twitch as he referred to Polina in such a way. “You are no longer a mere Lord-Prospect. I hereby declare you <em>Cascadian Lord!</em> Stand now, and serve me and our Divine Empress with your body and soul! Bleed for demonkind, and let demonkind bleed for you! Stand, Lord Halen! And answer! Will ye serve?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZGQ2ZWM5MDYzMzQzNjJhOWE0NWM1ZmRhYTFkYzVm">Serena swallowed and stood up with shaky legs. She bowed deeply, clasping her hands together. “With great honour, I will serve!” she declared with a strange intensity that was again unfamiliar to Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnMwZmYxNDJkOTQzMjQ5OWZhYjQ0Y2RkZTI4M2IxOTIx">“Make preparations for your flight and leave,” the overlord commanded, beginning to float upwards as the wind picked up again. As he rose, so did Polina’s sleeping form. It pained Amelia to see her friend be taken away from her. She dropped the eighth-circle ward on Polina and replaced it with the strongest sixth-circle one she knew. Despite being a lower tier, she was confident she could maintain this even without Speaking the First Word. She'd made a promise to Polina that she wouldn’t let anyone harm her, and it was a promise she intended not to break. Amelia would maintain this ward across the entire Empire if needed.</p>
<p class="cnM5MzRmNWZhN2Y0ZDQ1YjU4YzkzOTExNzUzMWQzNThl">“I will ensure the safety of the ship's inhabitants from above,” intoned the overlord as he entered the canopy.</p>
<p class="cnNmOGRmMjkzZjMyMDRhMmU4OTg1ZmE3ODg4ZjcyNzUz">“Y-yes, Overlord!” Serena shouted, remaining in her bow until the overlord and Polina had passed through the hole he had created in the forest canopy and travelled several kilometres above into the clouds, where he remained - in Amelia’s opinion - like a lingering fart.</p>
<p class="cnNhMGMyYzMyM2YyZDQxZTBhZmM5Y2M0YjRkZTE2NTI5">Serena eventually straightened, but didn’t say anything. It appeared she was deep in thought. Her mouth would occasionally curl into a smile before correcting itself. Perhaps she was happy? After all, Serena was now a full Cascadian Lord. That was like getting a massive promotion at work, right?</p>
<p class="cnNiMzhjZWQ0NTk1MTRmZmJhOWUzNDI2YTBiMzlmYjQ2">“Congratulations… I think?” Amelia said, unable to withstand the long silence. Serena turned to her.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWFlOTZlZmIxMTRiZDk5ZTE1ZTQ4NmRiOWY0MjU3">“Thank you, Amelia,” Serena said with a smile.</p>
<p class="cnMxZjM1ODNiZmEzMzQxOWFiYzhiMmYyMjY5N2IzM2E1">“Is… everything alright?”</p>
<p class="cnM3Nzc4ODI0NDUxMTQ3NTM5N2ZhMDgwMzdjNGJjOTMx">“Yes, I’m sorry,” Serena motioned for Amelia to come closer. When she bent her head down, Serena began massaging her feathered neck. Despite the mood not being quite right, Amelia couldn’t stop the deep rumbling of a purr erupting in her throat. “I’m quite literally <em>overjoyed</em>,” Serena explained. “I can’t put it into words. Becoming a Cascadian Lord this young? It’s a monumental achievement! Lots of things will change now…”</p>
<p class="cnMwNjcxYWNkM2IyMDQwN2FiYjdmN2I2MjFkNWE2Zjg1">“...Change?” Amelia muttered. She wasn’t sure what she thought of that.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjdmNDc0ZThiYjRkM2NhZmE2MWVkNjdhMzk2YmJk">“Yes, but in a good way, I think,” Serena said softly. “Now, it will be easier for me to protect you!”</p>
<p class="cnM3YTFhNGVmYzNkYTQ2NGJiMGRkMmZiMDFlYzI3YzY5">“Do I need protection?” Amelia wasn’t sure what level of attack she could withstand in this form, but it was surely far greater than anything Serena could handle. “I’m super strong, you know?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmJlYWQxNTZiNTQwZWE4NmE5ZGY3NTcwNGExODBl">“Not that kind of protection… you’ll see…” Serena gave her neck a hug and then withdrew. “Let’s prepare to leave! It might take a while to figure out the best way to secure this luggage. Here… hold this! Try not to slice the rope with your talons…” Serena set about tying the luggage together.</p>
<p class="cnM0Yjk1MjZiM2ZkYTQ5ZjI5ZTNjYTkyZjQzMGJkM2Jj">Eventually, they got it in a position where it was half strapped to Amelia and half cradled in her lower two arms. After assuring Serena multiple times that she definitely wasn’t going to drop it, Serena clambered onto her back, gripping Amelia’s feathers as she settled into a comfortable position.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzczZmFhYmQxOTQ2NTlhMTYyNDM5YzFiNTAwMTgy">“I’m worried… about Polina…” Amelia said, unable to stop herself from sounding sad. She was sure the overlord could hear her, but she didn’t care. “She’s going to wake up in a strange place, and I won’t be there!”</p>
<p class="cnM5NmI5NmY3Y2QxODRiM2I5OTU1ZDA4MDIwNTZjYTE4">“Don’t be,” Serena said. “Believe me, she’s so valuable not a hair on her head will be harmed. You can trust the overlords, they are principled and honourable. She'll likely be given a place to stay that makes The Highguard look like a slum in comparison.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMjZiODkxNjkzMDQ0YmQ5MjExODQzMGZhN2VmNWEx">“I hope so…” As long as Amelia maintained her ward on Polina, she could follow the trail of aether to her location. “I will write her a letter,” Amelia announced to herself, Serena, and the listening overlord. “I don’t want this forest to be the last time I see her!” Serena didn’t say anything in response, but Amelia was sure her stubbornness was recognised.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWIyMTRhYmFiYzQ2OTQ5NmFhNDc2YzFkOTlmNGQw">Once Serena confirmed she was secure on Amelia's back, Amelia used her other two hands and legs to clamber up a tree and through the forest canopy. “Wow…” she exclaimed, trying to ignore the blinding soul of the annoying overlord above them.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTcyYzcwYjZjMDQ3Y2NhYjcwYjBiZmUxOWYzNmQz">“What a beautiful night sky…” Serena mumbled from her back. “Look! You can see the blue moon! It’s only going to get bigger from now, until the next moonrain!” Amelia looked at the shining blue object in the far distant sky. Serena was right; it <em>was</em> beautiful. Amelia felt a yearning inside her. If she were a wolf, she would want to howl into the sky. Sadly, she couldn’t howl, but she <em>could</em> fly.</p>
<p class="cnM2NGU1Nzg3ZWU0MzQyZGRiNmNkOTIyMmE2ZjhiOGVh">“Ready?” Amelia called out as she unfurled her great wings under the night sky.</p>
<p class="cnM1MTk3MTUwNmM1MDRjNzRiNDhhNDI0ODA4YTVkOWIx">Flying would be easy, right?</p>
<p class="cnNjMjdhN2ZhYmYyNzRlMDg4OTNkMzNiZmFhNThjNzIy"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYWU2MDQ5MDY2OTQxOTE5NDZhZDBiM2FmNjMzNzM0"><img alt="New Scene - Lani POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/lani.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMxNWI0ZTA5ODI0MjRkZmI5NzZlYmRiZGM4N2Q2NmQ5">Lani paced around the room. She knew a dignified highborn lady like her <em>shouldn’t </em>pace, but she couldn’t stop herself! Every thirty seconds, she would glance out the window, looking down the road for the carriage that was supposed to have arrived <em>hours ago</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWVmM2RhNjNlYjQ0MjRhMDE2MTBhYmVkMzZiZmNl">“Ho ho… you’re an impatient one, aren’t you…” said an elderly maid as she tidied and cleaned the room. “Why don’t you sit down and read, young Lani? You’ll only tire yourself out.” Lani rolled her eyes. Why did old people always feel the need to give her constant advice? She could figure everything out by herself!</p>
<p class="cnM5NzdjZDhkOTI4OTQ4NDU5NWYyOTQ3NDlmNGZlNjEy">Nevertheless, she forced herself to sit down, turning to look in a mirror. She grumbled at what she saw. “They’ll get bigger, won’t they?” She asked the old maid. “They’re barely past four inches!”</p>
<p class="cnM1YTk0NjcwZjFlMjRjNTdhZWIxYmUyNGU2OTliYjQ3">“Of course, my dear Lani!” The maid gave her a reassuring smile. “You’ll have your growth spurt any day now! Besides, horns don’t stop growing until you’re far into your twenties! You have a <em>wonderful </em>set of horns, I bet all the boys try to talk to you all the time!” Lani giggled at the old maid’s words. Old people always had such nice things to say! Why didn’t she listen to them more often!?</p>
<p class="cnMwMmU0YTA1NGY4OTQyMTFiM2JkY2JhZDIzOGJhOGYy">“But… boys like big ones, right? Big like Serena’s?” Lani reached up and grasped her horns in her hands. Even with her small lady-like hands she could easily wrap them around each horn.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTFjZGNlOTAxNjRmM2RiZGFkMDlhN2M3ZWYzZDcy">“Some might… but others like smaller ones! Bigger isn’t always better, young Lani!” The old maid paused her cleaning and waggled a finger at her. “Don’t fixate on one thing! You have such lovely silky hair, and your eyes are every bit as crimson as any other member of House Halen!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NzYyZmQxNGZmZTRiY2JhYmIyZDlkZGFiNThkYjUy">“Hmm… you’re right! I <em>am </em>pretty!” Lani looked at herself in the mirror, feeling a lot better about her appearance. She should probably thank this old maid. Lani didn’t even know her name! “What’s-” she began before catching sight of a carriage slowly coming up the road. “Seven hells! She’s here! Out the way, old woman!”</p>
<p class="cnMxMzMxZTVhYjJkMjQ2OTY5Y2RmYWI0MTIyMjIxNGM1">Lani jumped up and ran out the bedroom, ignoring the maid calling after her not to run in the house. Down the stairs she went, taking them two at a time. Through the doors where her father and his attendant were waiting.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDUwYTIzOTAwNDRiYmZiZTYyMDdkYWVmZjE1Zjc4">“Lani! Behave yourself!” Father barked at her. Lani skidded to a stop, taking her position by her father. She almost couldn’t stop the rising excitement as the carriage came through the gates and pulled up in front of them. When the demon inside stepped out, and those familiar set of horns appeared, Lani couldn’t contain it any longer. She leapt from the steps and threw herself at her sister, giving her the best hug she could.</p>
<p class="cnM3MjU5NTlmZTNmMTQ0ZjRiMWRjYmZjN2JjZjVlNmFj">“Big sister!” Lani squealed, squeezing her harder. It didn’t matter how hard she squeezed; someone like her could never hurt her sister! “Welcome home!” Well, the family house in Shimashina wasn’t exactly <em>home</em>, that label belonged to the massive estate they all grew up in over in Asamaywa. Regardless, Serena would get the message.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzlmM2IzNDMyNjQwZDhiYzRkOWY0ZDZlZjY5YTEz">“Ooof! You’ve become so strong!” Serena exclaimed, hugging her sister back. “Look at your horns! They’ve become so big!”</p>
<p class="cnM5YmUzYjkxYWRkNjQ0YTliZWNlYzVmNjFkMDg2NTk3">“But not as big as yours!” Lani complained.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTI1YzI5MWIxMjRkNTZiMTEwZGY2YTI3ZDAzOTI1">“Well, make sure to eat everything on your plate! That worked for me!”</p>
<p class="cnNiY2RhNTc1ZWY0YjRiN2Y4ZTBlN2E2MDVmM2Q3NTVl">“Uh, <em>huh,</em>” Lani rolled her eyes. Her big sister was always giving her big-sister advice like that. Well, she could forgive Serena for now; after all-</p>
<p class="cnM3MmZlODc0NDU2YzQ2NDE5YzljODhkMWMwNTcwODNk">Oh, who was this?</p>
<p class="cnMzYTE4MTRmNTY0MDQ3ZmFiZGNhNDhmMWQyYjdmNDlh">Someone else clambered out of the carriage. It was a human wearing work clothes, with golden hair and a cap. “Hup!” the person exclaimed, jumping down from the carriage. They patted themselves down before looking around awkwardly.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTczZTRiYzhmNDQzNzI5MzkxOTFjMDU3MTRhM2Uw">“Human!” Lani called, breaking away from hugging her sister. “Who- oh, I’m sorry! I thought you were a human!” She smiled nervously, hoping she hadn’t insulted Serena’s friend, or was she a servant? Maybe an assistant? Poor girl, here Lani was, worried about her horns growing as big as Serena’s while this demon's horns were so small they were hidden under her hat!</p>
<p class="cnMxNWQwODkwY2RkZTQ0MDQ4MWI5ODU3ZmQ4MWE5ZTMw">If it weren’t for her crimson red eyes, every bit as blood red as any member of House Halen, Lani would have thought she was human!</p>
<p class="cnM3NWE4MTlmYWRlMjQ1ZDZiMDMxMWVlY2JiM2NkNzI2">“Hello!” Said the demon girl, “I’m Amelia! Nice to meet you!”</p>

      <description>Chapter Thirty-Six: Father and Daughter</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM4M2ExN2Y2Mzk0NTQwMWM5ODZjYjZiODA4NjIyZDJh"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNhOTY3MTA1ODQwZTQ4NTE5NmI2ZGYxYWJhNzIzZGY1">“We’re almost there,” Serena said as the carriage trundled along the road. There were no tramlines to the outskirts of Shimashina, so they had to make do with a horse-drawn carriage. “Remember your lessons. First impressions are important, especially towards my father.” The father in question would undoubtedly meet them when they arrived. Hopefully, their lateness didn't irritate him. After she and Amelia had run the last fifty klicks to Shimashina, rode the plateau lifts, met with the <em>Vengeance's </em>officers and explained what had happened, the sky had already darkened.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTRiMzgzYTE2NDQ3NzdhMDRlYmQxMzNlODM2ZWVj">“Don’t worry! I’m sure he’ll like me!” Amelia flashed a thumbs up, her now-crimson eyes brimming with excitement. From what Serena knew, it was normal for a Second Word transformation to leave lingering physical effects. Amelia was quite lucky only her eyes had changed since transforming back. Only time would tell whether they would stay red or eventually revert to her usual blue.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDBjMTQzZmZmZjRhZGZiODRhMThiN2YzY2ViNGUx">“Just… try only to speak when spoken to. I’m not sure how much he knows.” Serena said, thinking back to the previous events in the forest. The overlord had referred to Amelia as a <em>realm traveller,</em> which meant he knew she wasn’t a native of Karligard. If he knew that, then the greatlords below him likely knew. However, had that information filtered down to the highlords, such as her father?</p>
<p class="cnM2MTk2NGVjZmMzYzQzMzY4Njg1YjUyMzVkYjM1YTVl">Even more concerning was the thought that this information would also have risen above the overlord's station to the only one who could claim to be their superior. The thought of it made Serena want to squeeze her horns. Imagining that at some point, a document with her and Amelia’s names would have landed on <em>her</em> desk was extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="cnM3YWUyOTVlOTM4YTQ2ZDA5MmE0MzYxNzQ5ZGM2NDUx">How widespread would the information about Amelia Speaking <em>Asclepius</em> travel? The fact a Second Word had been Spoken in the East was already being whispered about; she had heard the locals gossiping about it outside the carriage. Damn it! Hopefully, House Halen wouldn’t be sued for the financial cost of scrambling hundreds of ships in response to Amelia’s Speaking!</p>
<p class="cnM3M2Q2N2JkYTNmZjQ3NjQ5Y2NiZjQ0NzU4MjBkNjMz">Serena <em>really</em> needed to have a proper sit-down and explain to Amelia how significant it was to get involved with the overlords. She thought she had explained it before but hadn’t accounted for Amelia’s naivety. Amelia hadn’t grown up in this realm, hadn’t developed alongside the culture that glorified and worshipped powerful Speakers. The problem was Amelia was too strong for her own good!</p>
<p class="cnNiNjNhMzdmNTJkNDQyYjhhMmMzYmQyYzY2ODQwZjRi">She felt herself almost shudder at the thought of what might have happened. There was a moment when Amelia looked like she might <em>challenge</em> the overlord over that human girl! Insanity! Even if - and it was a big if - the inexperienced Amelia could rival an overlord in a fight, any battle they might have had would surely have angered the slumbering animal god, <em>Rhaknam</em>! If he took flight in anger, then who knows what kind of catastrophe would have arisen! There were rumours that even an overlord would struggle against him!</p>
<p class="cnNkY2I5MDZlYmFmMDRlNWI4Njc2NGM0ZTcyNzUzYTdk">And, hell forbid, if Amelia somehow posed such a threat to the overlord, then he could call reinforcements! That scenario made Serena feel sick because there was only one entity that the overlord would have a right to call in such a situation, and if <em>she</em> turned up then Serena was sure she would just start crying. At that point, what could anyone do but beg for mercy?</p>
<p class="cnNhMzFlMjkzMDYwZjRiNmQ4ZjI5ZjBjYjQyM2MwZWUw">“You okay?” Amelia asked, “You’ve got that <em>I'm-thinking-about-things-that-make-me-want-to-grab-my-horns</em> look going on?” Amelia held Serena’s hand and fired off a small burst of healing which actually helped a little. “Are you that worried about meeting your family? I won’t mess up, I promise! Eee!” Amelia squirmed as Serena ruffled her girlfriend's hair. Sometimes, she felt a little jealous of Amelia. How nice would it be to be so powerful that everything felt like it wasn’t a problem?</p>
<p class="cnMxODcyZmM2OTYzMzQ2ZjQ4ZjRmMTQ3NWU0YzhhMjgz">“I’m alright, thank you,” Serena said, enjoying Amelia wiggling as her head was ruffled and patted. There was another matter they needed to discuss. Amelia’s confession. Sure, they had told each other they <em>liked</em> each other, but Amelia said she loved her! Only that idiot would have thought to use the presence of a <em>truth-teller</em> to confess her love! Serena didn’t know if the memory made her roll her eyes or squirm with delight!</p>
<p class="cnNiZGNkYzJkMjk1MjQyZTZiNDhmY2NhZmRjNWNiMDU0">She turned away from Amelia as the heat started to creep into her cheeks. Luckily, there was an adequate distraction out the window. They had arrived. “We’re here,” she said, quickly prompting Amelia to fix her hair. They came to a stop and Serena had barely left the carriage before a figure threw themselves at her, squeezing her tight.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjk3NWY5OWQ2ZTQxMjg4YTQ1YmVjZjZjYTE4NjQ1">“Big Sister!” Lani squealed as she hugged Serena as firmly as she could. “Welcome home!”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDE2NzJiNTMyMjQyZGJiNjFiYjViZWIwZjEzNjQ0">Serena couldn’t help smiling. Like Amelia, Lani was often a breath of fresh air away from the seriousness of her normal military life. As much as her little sister could be <em>extremely</em> annoying at times, it was for her happiness that Serena kept fighting. “Ooof”, she exclaimed, hugging Lani back. “You’ve become so strong! Look at your horns! They’ve become so big!”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjgzZTk1N2U3ODQ4MDI4ZTExZWQ5NmZiMmRlMjFi">“But not as big as yours!” Lani complained, looking up and puffing her cheeks out in a very Amelia-like fashion. Serena grinned and gave her little sister some big sister advice, telling her to eat a lot. Lani rolled her eyes, before spotting Amelia climbing down from the carriage.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzMzZGVhZTgwMjRkODc5Y2ZjZGFkMDVjYzJiZDdj">Lani broke away from Serena. “Human!” Lani called out, “Who- oh, I’m sorry! I thought you were a human!” Amelia didn’t seem offended; instead, she broke into a somewhat nervous but otherwise friendly smile before sticking her hand out.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTY4ZTYyMWMyYzQ0OWFiNzNhMDNiM2ZlMGFjNWE3">“Hello!” Amelia chirped, “I’m Amelia! Nice to meet you!”</p>
<p class="cnMzNTVjNDRmMjI1OTQ4YzI5NThkMWMxODdhYmM3MjJl">Lani looked blankly at Amelia’s hand, prompting Serena to sigh. She'd told Amelia that ladies didn’t shake hands, but the idiot kept doing it! “Amelia, women don’t shake hands, at least not in the East.” Serena turned her attention to her little sister. “Lani, this is Amelia Thornheart. Despite her eye colour, she is <em>human</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NzVlMTRhNmVlZTRkYTQ5OTU5OTIwNWE4NzM0ODIz">“Huh!” Lani looked between her and Amelia. “You’re human!? Why do your eyes look like mine!”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjY4Yzc4NzIxNzQ0NDQ5NTE3N2ZmMzgzZTlmNmQ4">“Ah…” Amelia withdrew her hand and scratched her nose. “Some uh, spellwork backfired. My eyes are actually blue, you see…”</p>
<p class="cnMwODFlZTQ0OTY0MjRmZjU5YWQwNmUxMmZjZWY4NWZi">“Oooh, a spell! You’re a mage!? The teachers say humans make poor mages, is that true? I heard humans aren’t as intelligent as demons! Isn’t your kind super weak!?” Lani fired off question after question, not taking into consideration the atmosphere. In that way, she had another similarity with Amelia. “Why would someone like you be with Big Sister? Are you a slave!? Did she capture you!?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NDg4YzU0YjY1ZDQ3NTg4N2Q1Mzc5NzMzMDVhMzkx">“Lani!” Serena barked, switching right past stern-captain mode and into the much more dangerous angry-big-sister mode. “Amelia is a talented <em>Speaker</em> and a willing employee in <em>my </em>retinue. Remember <em>your</em> manners! Apologize!”</p>
<p class="cnNhNzkwYTY3YmMyNzRiNDBhMjlmOTNiZjViYzY2MzU1">“Eeek!” Lani squeaked, “I’m sorry, Miss Amelia!”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjM1ZDNjZGM3MTQ5YzViMDk5MWFjNTY1NTU5MzEy">“<em>Speaker</em> Thornheart!”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDRhYjJkYzg3MTRhYmFiMzhkZjBmOTUyZTJiZWQ0">“S-Speaker Thornheart!” Lani stuttered, “I’m sorry!”</p>
<p class="cnM0N2MwMDFkZjdlZjRhNjBhY2E4ZDVmNmRjZGE2NWU1">“Hehe, it’s okay!” Amelia bent forward with a smile. “I like your horns! They’re so symmetrical! I wish I had horns!”</p>
<p class="cnM1NmI0MWMxZDE4NTQyZmI5MTU2YjRhMmM2YmQxOGI5">“You… you really think so!?” Lani beamed at the naked flattery. “It must be so weird not to have anything up there…” Lani tapped her horns. “Doesn’t it feel weird?”</p>
<p class="cnNiZWFmM2QwZDY3MzRmZGQ5ODI5ZmFkNDBhZGMyMzU5">“I don’t know,” Amelia said with a shrug. “I’ve never had horns to know what it feels like!”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDEwOTYyMGYyZDQyNjVhNDlkZDk0ZDNiMzMzNGVi">“But-”</p>
<p class="cnMxZmNiY2ZjMTE1YzQ3Njk4YzAxN2NiODBmYzJjZDA2">“<em>Ahem!</em>” The authoritative yet polite <em>cough</em> cut Lani off. Serena’s stoic father lowered his hand. “Lani, come back here. Serena, my daughter... it’s been too long. How was Kenhoro?” Serena took the cue and approached her father, surprising him with a sudden hug. It wasn’t something she usually did, and she felt a little mischievous doing so. The widening of her father's eyes behind a pair of neat spectacles was a worthwhile reaction.</p>
<p class="cnMyN2ZlYzUyYzFiMjRiNDA4MWEwMjcyOGEyMzIzOTJm">It seemed a little bit of Amelia’s cheekiness had rubbed off on her.</p>
<p class="cnM1OTU2NWMwZTEzODRmYjM5YTZmN2RjYmE5Njg3OTk2">“Hello, Father,” Serena said. “Kenhoro was busy… We found time to attend the festival. Oh, we bumped into Uncle Yulan!” Serena was confident her father had received a report of the many chaotic events they had been involved in. Even so, there wasn’t any need to bring up how she, Amelia and Lord Yulan leapt out of his penthouse suite, was there? “He’s doing good. Sends his best.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGJlN2RlNGRjMDQwNzg4MDM1OGEzZjViZWJjZDNh">She turned to the old butler beside Father. The tidy old demon was standing impeccably, dressed in a black and white uniform. “Johan, I hope Father isn’t working you too hard. Make sure you’re taking your holiday.” Johan inclined towards her with a perfect bow.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTRlNWUyYzZlNzQ3OTViNmVhZmMzYjViZWY2NmVj">“On the contrary, it is I who pressures your father to take breaks,” Johan said with a smile. “Welcome back to Shimashina, Lady Halen.” He turned towards Amelia. “Speaker Thornheart, welcome.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYWE5ZDQzMGIyZDQyMDNiMzYzYmIzMzM0MGI0ODk0">“I never thought I would meet a human Speaker under these circumstances,” Father said with a small bow. “Nevertheless, fate must have led us to this moment. Welcome to Shimashina, Speaker Thornheart. House Halen will do everything in its power to ensure you are not left wanting during your stay.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNjUyNmFiZDA2OTRlM2E5OTg4MzdlYzJhZDQ1MDk2">For a moment, Serena was worried Amelia was going to stick her hand out for another handshake. Thankfully, the idiot remembered the appropriate curtsy and performed it with a surprising amount of grace. She would have guessed the human was highborn if she hadn’t known that nobility wasn’t really a thing in Amelia’s original world.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmJlMmZkNzE1NDQzNjc4NzA4NGFiYjQ5ZDg2YWMy">“You are most kind,” Amelia intoned. “I look forward to your hospitality.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NjQxODU5NTU5NzRmNWY5YTRlMTExNmY3MjUzMGUy">“Speaker Thornheart,” Johan began, “we have prepared you a room. May I lead you there and give you a tour of the house? Lord Halen has urgent matters to discuss with his daughter.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNGFmZmFhMjUyZTRkYTZiZjE1NjFjYzIzMGM1NTk0">“Oh!” Lani suddenly piped up. “Me! Let me do it! My friends are <em>not going to believe</em> that I’m friends with a human Speaker<em>!</em> Sia is going to be <em>so jealous!</em>” Lani giggled. “Please, Father! Let me do it! I’m so bored here!” Serena’s crafty little sister put on her best act of pleading.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTE1M2RmMzE5ODQyOWU4ODE2NDRjYjVjOTJkNzJj">Father cast Serena a glance, and she returned a quick nod. “Amelia, if you could…” Serena began. She didn’t need to give any further encouragement as Amelia flashed a knowing grin and let Johan lead her away. Lani bounced around Amelia as if she were an over-excited <em>peeka</em>. As they disappeared into the house, Serena could hear her little sister ask if Amelia knew any <em>horn-growing</em> spells.</p><span class="cjNjYWFhOTJkOTQ2ZTRmMWRiYmEzZTk0ZGZlNDJiMWMx"><br/>If you come across this story on Amazon, it's taken without permission from the author.

<p class="cnNlMjZlNTM2YjQ5MTQwNmNiNGU5ZDI1Mzk4YTU4Mzg5">Those two idiots would get on just fine.</p>
<p class="cnMyNzEyZTU1YTFlNzQ5YjliMjFkOTQ1NzhmY2U0ODNh">“Your office?” Serena asked, and her father nodded, guiding her. The two of them began heading into the house. The small estate wasn’t as glamorous as the proper family home in Asamaywa. Chosen due to its closeness to the industrial sector, where House Halen had some of their Shimashina operations. It also boasted extensive gardens, providing a sense of privacy and quiet away from the bustling trade city.</p>
<p class="cnM3YWI2ZWFmZWE1YzQwMThiY2I0NjcxOGYxZDc4NjU0">“Mother and Nina?” Serena asked Father as they reached his office.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDU4ZGUwYTljZDQzY2ZhOWU2OWU5ZjZkNWY4NDJl">“Your mother refused to come, said she preferred to weather storm-season at home. Although I suspect she simply dislikes Shimashina. You know how she feels about kami worship.” He chuckled, closing the door and inviting Serena to sit down. “As for Nina, she’s so busy she barely sends a letter a month. She’s trying to recreate the runecraft the humans inscribed onto the torpedo that hit the<em> Vengeance</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYTE2ZWVmZGM4NjQwZGY4MGE1MTY3MDk4N2Q0MjA3">“Ah…” Serena began. It seemed so long ago, but it was only six weeks since the battle of Port Highwind. That torpedo - somehow enhanced by the human Writers - had begun a chain of events that led her to Kenhoro and everything that happened since. “Any luck?” Serena asked, feeling a little guilty. The documents they had recovered from the citadel detailing the device had been destroyed when she lost control of <em>Narean</em> and battled Korvus.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTU5NWVlZWU1YzQ3YjJiOWY5NTBmYmI1NzI3N2Ux">“Some, but it’s slow progress. They can’t figure out how they managed to Write it so <em>small</em>.” Father sighed, removing his spectacles and cleaning them in a manner that reminded Serena of her quartermaster. “Whatever it is, they’re making more of them. Admiral Zhao went down over Republican territory.”</p>
<p class="cnNlZDQ2NjMxY2RlYzQwOGQ4OTlhZGM5YjFhMjEzZGE4">“The <em>Viper</em> was hit!?” Serena exclaimed. The flagship of the Kenhoro fleet was a proper battleship, dwarfing the <em>Vengeance,</em> and was equipped with as much armour as its quad-expansion lift engine could handle. She had heard nothing about this in the Kenhoro broadsheets. “What happened?” she asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTg1NzM5YTRmNTQxMDliMDQ2NDU0MzUzOGJhNDli">“Details are a little sparse, but it appears she got swarmed. They hit the propulsion engine and the admiral had no choice but to conduct a controlled crash. It blunted the offensive as the priority changed to securing the admiral and the <em>Viper</em>. Gave the enemy time to stabilize the line.” Father shook his head. “A massive ship like that, falling to a few flies. It shouldn’t happen.” He reached into his desk and produced a two-inch shell. “Look at this,” he said, passing the shell to Serena.</p>
<p class="cnM1NTRmOWE2YjE5YzRlNjZiYTJkYjAxMTAzNmQzZWYy">“Flak?” she asked, recognising the military markings stamped upon it.</p>
<p class="cnM5NmMyZGJiNGFkZDQ5NGY4NmJkOTE5MjBiYWE5OTBl">“A new kind of fuse. A proximity fuse. This one is inert, but in practice it activates only when fired from a gun. It reacts to the metal of the enemy ship or missile and detonates itself. No more manually timing fuses.” He slid a document over. “Look at this table. Eighty per cent interception rate in testing. That’s compared to nine per cent with manual fuses.”</p>
<p class="cnNjOGNjNDg0MTQ2NjQ5ZDA5NDJiMWZiMWM4MmVkYTdm">“Eighty percent…” Serena murmured. “Are we making these?” She asked, passing the shell back to her Father.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjIxNTViZjA0YTQ0YjZhNGE0NTg1YWMyZGJmZDk4">“In small quantities, but I’m refurbishing our production lines. Soon, all of our flak production will be using this fuse.” He rolled the shell in his fingers, a thoughtful expression appearing on his aged face. “It’s ingenious. The first version used a chemical battery, but the shells would detonate or fail if they got too close to the lumina, so they installed an aether switch.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZTQyYTUxM2JlZDRlYjVhMjMyMGJmZmQxMzNhNzg3">“I’ve been thinking,” Serena began, “we’re seeing a shift in air strategy. The Republic can’t produce large ships to counter our battleships, so they’ve been forced to innovate with lightcraft, and it’s <em>working</em>. One lightcraft with a spell-infused torpedo taking out a cruiser or battleship? That’s an exchange ratio we can’t afford to leave be…” Serena adjusted in the chair, tapping one of her horns in thought. “How many flak batteries does a typical battleship have? Eight? It’s not going to be enough. If the primary threat to battleships becomes swarms of lightcraft, then they need to install <em>far more</em>. Maybe two dozen? Or more?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNTg1Y2Y2NDY5ZDQ4NjFhMzcwNTMyOGE0MGEyMGEy">“I see we’re of similar mind,” Father said with a nod. “I’ve been doing my best to raise this with the Eastern high command and have been <em>somewhat</em> successful. If we can get positive results in the air, then the North will follow quickly. It’s only… Centralis. They’re slow to adapt and change.” He leaned forward, clenching his hands together and resting his chin upon them. “I was there a few months ago, at the grand shipyards of Noheim… they’re building an entirely new class of ship. They’re <em>enormous</em>, far larger than any flagship so far. They’re calling them <em>capital ships</em>. When I saw it…”</p>
<p class="cnMwNTdkNDJjMWJlMDQ0MDQ4NjRkMGE1YzM2Y2FjMDEy">Her father paused, his eyes unfocused as he recalled the memory. “At first, it provoked a feeling of confidence. To think demon hands could build something so <em>mighty</em>. I saw the <em>power</em> of Centralis.” He clenched his fist, squeezing it tight. “Yet I have this feeling of foreboding I cannot dispel. I struggle to fathom the cost of building a ship of that size, and if it were to fall in battle? Against some human creation like these new torpedos?”</p>
<p class="cnNjY2VkMDcyZTk0ZjQ0MzU4N2E4OGJlMTQyZDJiZjBl">The crimson eyes sharpened again. “The Republic might be losing this war, but the other human nations are not idle. They are building up their fleets. Something bigger is brewing on the horizon… yes, there’s profit to be made… but it’s <em>more</em> than that… this is a test of the Empire, a <em>real</em> test.” Suddenly, he looked very tired and Serena realised Johan was not jesting when he mentioned her father’s heavy workload.</p>
<p class="cnMwZGRmZGVmMDM1ODQyZjRiZTUyZWEzYTMwYWU5NjVk">“Father,” Serena said. “You’re exhausted. Take some time off. If you were a member of my crew, I would order it.” She reached out with a tentative hand, hesitating momentarily before placing it on his shoulder. It was a slightly uncomfortable moment. Physical contact and familial affection weren’t as common between her and Father compared to her sisters and mother.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjhmYmZlOWRiOTRiZjk4MTA5ZmM3NjA5NGEwNTc1">“Ha… a mere Lord-Prospect? Ordering a Highlord? Seems like something you would do…”</p>
<p class="cnNjMWU1MjkwYzMxMTQ3YzJiZDkzYTQ1MjFhYWVjYzY2">Serena blinked as she processed what her father had said. “Father, you haven’t heard?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZDZlNzQ0NjA0MjRhOGI4NmRjMjIzYzllMTMwZWM3">“Heard what?”</p>
<p class="cnM3YjdjOWQ0MjQ5NjQ3M2I5NDhmMGZhZGIwYTFlYjZh">“I’m no longer <em>Lady Halen</em>,” she began, her words prompting her father to look at her in confusion. “I am now <em>Lord Halen</em>, by decree of the overlord. He-”</p>
<p class="cnNiYjZlYWQ1YTQ1YzQ3YzE4NjQ4MjkxMjMxOWY5MTlk">“Serena!” her father yelled, standing up frantically and knocking his chair to the ground. For a moment, she thought he was angry but he was only surprised. “You made <em>Cascadian Lord?</em> When!?”</p>
<p class="cnM1N2NlODU1ZDhhNjRmZWRiZjFjN2YxZTNkNmNlYzZm">Serena recounted some of last night's events. Her father was aware the <em>Sakamoto</em> went down but didn’t appear to know Polina was the cause. The overlord made her <em>Cascadian Lord</em> for her capture of Polina, but she simply described it as due to her <em>military achievements</em> and let her father assume it was her actions in the battle of Port Highwind.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTYzNmQ4YjJhZDRiMDVhNjFlMWQ2YmI5YWJiYmEz">“Tremendous stuff, Serena, my daughter!” Father's face looked a decade younger as he congratulated her. “I’ll have to write a letter to your mother and another to Nina! Or, perhaps you should do it? They’ll both be thrilled! Two lords in the family! Another <em>Lord Halen</em>, hmm… things might get confusing around here.” He picked his chair up and sat back down.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDRhNzY3ZTAxODQwNjhhZmU1NWZiNjMzZDYzNzFi">“We’ll manage,” Serena said with a smile. Father insisted on a toast and dug out a bottle of red loqua. For a while, they sat in a happy silence, talking around the inevitable topic while sipping the delicious Western drink. “Well,” Serena said after the third lull in the conversation. “Shall we address the arcwhale in the room?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MWU2MGU2YzA1YzRiNzhiNDU4ZmM3NTAzYjFlNWJm">“The human,” her father said cooly, placing down his glass.</p>
<p class="cnMxNmVlNTc2OWM2NjQ2ODE4YTExZDQ0NWQyZTc5NDU2">“Amelia, yes.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjZkYzBjMzdhZTQ1Y2ZhZjQ0MWVmZTQ2MWM0Y2Uy">“When I heard you’d become involved with a human Speaker, especially a healer… I admit I panicked a little. I pulled all kinds of favours to get the orders dispatched for you to come here.” He took a slow breath before continuing, “I thought… well, I’m not sure what I thought. Was it a trick? Were you being deceived, or were you deceiving the human? She appeared, and the next moment, you're fighting Korvus Maranai. Your actions seemed mad. I was… concerned.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzQ3YmFiMjg2NjQ3MDU5MDQ5YzVmNmI4ODZiYTZi">“Then, as I waited... reports came in that the human saved your life, defended you against those Speakers in Kenhoro - I started to think maybe you weren’t mad.” He cast a long look at her and Serena held his gaze. “I was about to petition the greatlord to intervene directly when he contacted me first. He explained the human was already under surveillance and you were protected. Still, I was worried.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMWI3ODhjMzJhNzQwY2JiZWVkOTgzYTRlMzQ1MjJk">He took a slow sip of the loqua. “It’s strange. The reports described her as having blue eyes, yet shortly after a Second Word was Spoken, right around where the <em>Sakamoto</em> went down, her eyes seemed to have become a new colour.” His face turned grim. “Do I need to ask?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMTU0ZmVhZDNhNjQwMDg5Y2QyNTM1MjVlNDdlZTY1">“She’s powerful,” Serena explained bluntly. “Beyond you or me. Beyond both of us together. Don’t think you can intimidate her into doing anything; she’s too strong for that and too naive to have the tact to navigate Cascadian politics. Remember, she is employed as part of <em>my retinue</em>; she is not yours to command.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZTZkODRiZGI1MTRhZDZiODY5MGU4OTcxN2RhYjVj">“Is she a threat to the house?” Father asked.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGEzOTAyMDk3OTQ0MWI4OTVmNWU5NDdkYWVkNGM3">“No more than I am.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYjE5MjYxYzFjZTRkYzk4YmMxYTFmNGIyMjZhNzEw">“No more than you are…” he murmured. “Serena, the walls you’ve kept up since your brother's death seem to have weakened. You're more... emotional. Don't think I haven't noticed that you call her <em>Amelia</em>, not using the proper title of <em>Speaker Thornheart</em>.” The mention of Gin caused Serena's heart to twist. Perhaps if her brother never died she wouldn’t be in the military, perhaps her father wouldn’t be working so hard.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjMzNjg1N2E4YjQ4ZjZhMGY4ZjQ5ZGFkYzFjODhj">Perhaps she would have never met Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTg1NTQwNWEzMjRmNmVhYTVmNjM5ODYzYTkyYjg4">“We have a good relationship. After all, we’ve been through… situations together.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NmE0YWVjYjIzYTQwNzRiY2IwZDY0MmNjY2NjZTY2">“I’ve noticed she’s… attractive for a human,” he said, causing Serena to resist a gulp as she identified what direction he was going in. “I am concerned… that your <em>disposition</em> may have caused you to make… poor decisions.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MGVkMGJiMzUxYTRjOWE4ZDI5ZjhmNzMwZTM3YjFj">“My <em>disposition</em> is not a matter for your concern,” Serena said sternly, sensing her annoyance rising. “As a highlord, you should be well aware of how <em>improper</em> of a subject this is to discuss with another lord.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNzY5YjcyNTQyMTRlODg5NzRhMzRiNzYzMmVmOWI2">“I’m not asking as a highlord!” Father suddenly called out, a note of desperation in his voice. “I’m asking as your <em>father</em>. I’m asking my <em>daughter</em>, not the lord she has become!” He took his spectacles off and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “I apologize, Serena. It’s just… even before you became a Speaker, you had plenty of worthy suitors. When you became a Speaker, you would have had your pick. And now? The sky's the limit! Any family would twist their horns backwards for you to marry into them. Tell me, is this… <em>human...</em> really what you want?”</p>
<p class="cnMxYzIwZDZjMGY3YjRkMGVhMzRmZmU0NTMwMDM0ZjI5">Serena was quiet for a full minute while she figured out how best to answer. Settling on her wording, she opened her mouth, ensuring she sounded calm. “Father, as your <em>daughter</em>, I beg for your understanding. I am under no delusion, no spell or deception. I would not have chosen this if I thought it would harm our House. You have a <em>Cascadian Lord</em> as a daughter who will <em>always</em> protect you. And you have a <em>Second Word</em> Speaker who will protect <em>me</em>. And… most of all…” Serena gave a weak smile. “She makes me happy.”</p>
<p class="cnM2YzVlMDJjOGM2ZjRiMTQ4OTBhZjE5Mjc0YTE0Nzgx">Her father was quiet for a moment. “How strange. I said the same thing to Greatlord Oshiro decades ago." Seeing Serena's confused expression, he smiled softly. "We fought once, you know? Back when he was a highlord and I a mere lord. We fought for your mother, who we both fancied terribly. Ha…” He snorted before pouring himself some more loqua. “He thrashed me, obviously. Still, I refused to end the duel, to give up. By law, he could have continued and taken my life, but instead he asked me… <em>why?</em> Just that question: <em>why?</em> I said the same thing; <em>she makes me happy</em>. Somehow, that was enough, and he just…backed off.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjNhYmNhM2UwZjQxOTU5N2RiNDlhNGZjOTBjZTJm">“... I didn’t know.”</p>
<p class="cnNiY2QwZmRlMzllODQzOGE4MGNlZDBjMWViNjNmYjk2">“It’s just a silly old story anyway,” he sniffed, fiddling with the glass. “Still... what about children? Don’t you want some? No matter how powerful she is, I doubt she could put a baby in you.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjk3MzNiNjM4NDQ0YWU5NjVmYzU2OTdiZjQ2MDQz">“Dad!” Serena blurted out, feeling heat rush to her cheeks. “Why did you say that!?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MDQwMzVkNmRhMDRlNTQ4M2U4OTRmNTA3NTJmNTQ2">“What?” he replied as if he did nothing wrong. “I’m an old man, and I want my grandchildren. Nina is married to her work, and Lani is too young.”</p>
<p class="cnNmM2RhZDViMmEyNzQ3NjdhNWYyOTNmYTJiMWY5MGZi">“Tsk! I don’t know about Nina, but you shouldn’t worry about Lani. All she thinks about is which boy she’s going to marry and what she’s going to name her children. She’ll be popping little horns out one after another when she reaches adulthood. Ha!” Serena laughed, and her father joined her. The atmosphere became noticeably lighter.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGI3M2Y2ZTA4NDRiNjc4ZmIwMTczMDI2YmE3Njkw">“The human-”</p>
<p class="cnNkYzA2Mjk0NDQ3ZTRhMzE4NjcwNTBhMmNhN2U3NWVk">“Amelia,” Serena corrected.</p>
<p class="cnM0NmRlYmY5OWFiMzQ0ZGNiY2Q4NGUxZTNjMjFmZjc3">“Right. Amelia and Lani seem like they’ll get on. She’s always complaining about being bored despite being provided with anything she wants. I think I spoil her too much…” he took a sip of the loqua, smiling. “But what’s the point of being a father if I can’t at least spoil my youngest daughter?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGQwMDc4MTdmZTRkYTlhYjJmZmNhMjlhZmJkMjU0">“Don’t be too soft with her; it’ll come back and bite you.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MGRiZmQ2NDExZTQ4MTliMDJkYjY3MzJkN2EwNThl">“Hmm…” he murmured. He opened his mouth to say something but was interrupted by a bell sounding in the office. The small bell was connected to the kitchens by a string. “Dinner is ready. It’ll be nice to have a friendly conversation with the… I mean your… uh... Amelia.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZGQxMmZmZjE3ZDQ3ZjQ4ZTdkYTZhYmViM2ViMzU2">“She only wants to impress you. She’s been going on about meeting the family for weeks.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjQyOTE3NTdkNzQzOTI4MmQ3YTgzNWI2MmQ5ZTg4">“Is that so…” he suddenly paused. “One last thing. Her origins. I’ve been told she’s from Karligard, but her accent is perfect Centralis Imperial. Is there…” he raised a questioning eyebrow, “...something I need to know?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NGExYmQ5MTkxZjRmOWQ5Yzc0NDZkOGJiY2RmNzBj">“Nothing someone like you wouldn’t be able to deduce by yourself over time,” Serena said frankly. It was only a matter of time before her father twigged Amelia came from a different realm. “It would be best to avoid that topic of conversation. Stick with… simple things, oh, and try not to be too surprised when she says or does something weird or incredible like it’s nothing at all. She’s just like that.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYWY5MWJiODgxODQ5MTE4MWUwMmJiYzA1MDZiOTU2">“I see. I hope Lani behaves…” her father stood up and neatened his clothes. “Shall we?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMmFkNTVkOTU3MDRkZDI5MmE0ZDNhOTE4ZTM0ZGJl">Serena stood up and together they headed to the dining hall.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDM4OTk0ZDc4OTQyMGJhYWQ3ZTVmMWUxODMwNTZh">Her first family dinner with Amelia.</p>

      <description>Chapter Thirty-Seven: A Whispered Confession</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMxMThiYjEyZDIyYTRhYzE4YzBlMmY0NmNlMThiMzll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTBhYzI1ZDlmMjQwYjU5ODYyYjNlMzU3ZDMzZTVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena sat down at the ironwood table. It wasn’t comparable to the enormous gold-trimmed table in the grand dining hall at their home estate. Instead, this table only politely whispered of House Halen’s wealth. The rest of the room continued in a similar vein, boasting great tapestries and heavily-framed paintings. While not produced by the most skilled artists in the Empire, these still exuded a quiet sense of affluence.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzFiN2ZhM2FkZjRjMzM4YzYyMTJlNTc5NTg3YTE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking across the table, Serena found the Empress of Cascadia looking back at her. At least, through painted eyes. “What made you choose that incarnation?” she asked Father, nodding towards the painting.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmY5YThiZjYyZDQ4NWM4MzRhODVhOTJlNGY1NTJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The horns,” he replied, sitting next to her. “Your grandfather had horns that curved back like that, a sign of his southern heritage. Also, her black hair reminds me of my beautiful daughters, even when they cause me endless trouble.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTBhYjUyYzEwZTQ5MTY4MWZiMDE3MmU3MzMxZjEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena eyed the painting. The dignified and stoic depiction of the Divine Empress consciously made her straighten her posture and raise her chin. She wouldn’t volunteer the information, but when she was in the academy, she would study paintings of the Empress and try to capture the feeling of power and control that the Imperial figure seemed to exude no matter what medium depicted her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjg5NjI2NGYwYjQ3MTNiNWQ2OGI0Nzk5NjA0ZTNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While she pondered the painting, the door opened, and a group of employees bowed quickly before entering and busying themselves with tasks. Drinks were poured, cutlery was placed, and candles were lit. Eyeing the bottle before her, she raised an eyebrow at her father. “More red loqua?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTE0NGM3ZjkzYjRmN2VhOGVhMTZiZjI0ZmRiOTk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A celebration!” he replied enthusiastically. “You made </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Cascadian Lord!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Red loqua is the least we could do! I’ll throw a grand dinner when we’re next in Asamaywa, invite all the local lords…” Serena nodded but made a mental note to tell her father in the future to ensure any potential guests knew that she was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the market for a husband. In the past, she’d already begun avoiding social events due to the persistent attempts at wooing her, and it would only become worse now she was a full lord.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDU1ZGUxN2Q0OTRiYWFiOGRiMTNiNjQ1NTQxYTNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope that’s juice,” Serena said, motioning to the bottle of blue loqua set down where Lani would be seated. She hoped her father's spoiling of her little sister didn’t go as far as providing her with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">alcohol</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWU5YmQ3ZWIzOTQ0Nzc4NDkyNTlmMTNhZTg2NGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hrmph! What kind of father do you take me for? Although…” He leaned towards Serena and spoke quietly, “She’s almost at that age where her friends might pressure her to drink at the academy. I was hoping you could have a few words with her. She does look up to-” He was cut off as the doors opened again. “Ah, Lani! And…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjY0ZjQzNTBhNDQ4NTBhMjljMTMyYTg3ZTM2ZTRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind Lani, a familiar bundle of blond hair and now-crimson eyes appeared. Serena and her Father stood up as Amelia entered the room. “Speaker Thornheart! Please, sit!” he gestured towards the seat opposite Serena and next to Lani. “I hope Lani has been behaving herself,” he said, earning a stuck-out tongue from the cheeky little sister.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWY0MzhhMzNhNzQ2OGI4ZWVhOTJmMjcxYTNiMzIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lani! Manners!” Serena barked before narrowing her eyes. “What do you think you’re doing?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjBlYWQ4MThjYzQxODc4OTk3YWM5NGZlNWQ1ZDUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh… sitting down?” Lani replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTJmYmYxYjdhNjRiY2ZiNGY4YmIxZTU0ZDllOTY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sitting down at the table </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">before</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speaker Thornheart has sat down? Are they teaching you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">anything</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> at the academy?” Serena crossed her arms and cast a medium-level glare at her little sister, who only half-rolled her eyes in response.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWZiMjQ2NWQ1MDQ1ZGQ4ZDc2ZTk4ZTE4ZWVkNWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, a half-roll meant Lani </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> gotten more polite, if only by a fraction.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDY5NzBlZTlmYjQ4NjBhYWY2Yzg2MjEwNzVkNDli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">unconventional</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of me,” Lani spun around, facing Amelia. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, my deepest apologies.” Amelia looked back and forth awkwardly before sliding into the chair opposite Serena with an expression she knew meant Amelia was uncomfortable but putting on a brave face. After Amelia was settled, Serena and her father followed, and then Lani finally sat down.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDk3ZGE3ZTliMzQ1NTZiNDNkZWQ3ZTUxNzJlOTc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No need to call me Speaker Thornheart!” Amelia chirped after a moment of quiet. “You’re all welcome to call me Amelia. In fact, I’d prefer it!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTVkYWNlMzQ0YTQxMGM5NTkxZmM3MzQzNGNlNDg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How considerate, Speaker-</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ahem</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Amelia,” Father began, correcting himself with a polite cough. “Then please also call me by my name. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Dalinar</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” At this, Amelia beamed and immediately appeared more comfortable. Serena sighed inwardly, Amelia really didn’t hide her emotions or feelings at all. Anyone could read her like an open book, which was both a boon and a curse.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDQ1NzQzN2UyZTQ1NGFhMDljMDUzZGJjOGM3MzFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena resisted a side glance at her father. He was being unusually docile. He’d never liked discussing it, but Serena always knew he disapproved of her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">disposition</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was somewhat surprising he had accepted the situation so readily. He had barely given her any pushback during their earlier conversation and was treating Amelia like an honoured guest.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWVlMmViZDNhNjQ5YjJhNzljNDhmZTJjODk5NTY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The more she thought about it, the more it made perfect sense. Her father was, above everything else, a pragmatist and a rationalist. Despite the political fallout of House Halen publically supporting a human Speaker, and the inevitable loss of business as a result, the benefits of even being slightly supported by a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Second Word</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speaker were far greater. It was almost equivalent to the eastern overlord breaking his usual political neutrality and publically supporting a single house above all others.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTQ3NTNkZjBhYTQ0ZDdhODIxMDc0ZDNiYTBjY2M4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Amelia was connected to House Halen indirectly through Serena, her father, who was an expert at navigating Cascadian nobility, would be able to maximise his gains while hopefully avoiding the risk of Amelia’s ire. If it was ten years ago, her father might have disowned Serena for her actions. Now, the fire in his horns had cooled enough for these events to only cause a little friction between them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzc4NTQ4YTk3NjQ5NDZiODBmODQ2MGI2MmQxMzRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The house employees appeared again with the first course, a delicate fruitbread that etiquette dictated precisely how it was supposed to be eaten. Amelia had a good go, and Serena felt a little proud at her lessons bearing fruit. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmRhNDNlMzhmNzRlMTViOTQ4MGIzOTdjNDE5MzY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, Lani disagreed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjljMjkyNGE4NDQ5MTA4ZTRkYjI0Nzg4ZTkyZjkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not like that! Amelia, watch me!” Lani demonstrated and began giving Amelia an impromptu lesson on how to cut fruitbread as a proper lady. Serena watched her little sister with some amusement. Lani seemed to be trying to take a big-sister role, which didn’t make much sense considering Amelia was ten years Lani’s senior. Nevertheless, it was a sweet gesture, and Amelia seemed happy to play along.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTc1ZGM4YThlMDRkMDliMTYyNmY1MWFkYTc0NjUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was nice to see Amelia make a friend. Especially a friend that Serena knew wasn’t a spy in disguise. Tsk! She resisted twitching with annoyance. Serena needed to have another conversation with Amelia about Polina. She still struggled to understand why Amelia was so determined to protect someone who had attempted to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">harm her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. If it weren’t for Serena’s absolute confidence in Amelia’s loyalty towards herself, she would have been inclined to describe her girlfriend’s actions as a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">betrayal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDM1NDBlZGFhNjQ4MzRhZjJlMjQ5ZjUwMGJkMGU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, she tried to remember that Amelia wasn’t in her right mind, having been transformed by the Second Word, and that her girlfriend was from a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">separate realm</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> with common sense that was completely unlike anything found in Cascadia. Amelia held an underlying belief system that was foreign to Serena. She struggled to wrap her mind around it, but it was slowly starting to make sense or, at the very least, become predictable.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2MyMWViZjNlMTQyNjM4NGIwZmMyZjE2NmVkZjQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be a difficult conversation for both of them and, unfortunately, something that a captain couldn't ignore. Amelia’s actions were the kind that might endanger the crew of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and therefore Serena needed to understand them fully. Even more problematic was that when they had that future conversation, Amelia would demand that Serena explain the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">incident</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that motivated Polina.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDAyOWI0YmNiMTQ1MDFhNmNiODk0ZDE1OGM3YTcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Serena?” someone asked, and Serena blinked, looking around. She had become lost in her own thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjU1OTBmMjljMTRmMGZiZDEzMTFmNmIzOGZkOGRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apologies, it’s been a long day,” she said. “What did I miss?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDE5NmNmYTU3ZjQ2NWJiMTNmNmNhMTI4M2M2NGIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Father says there’s something you have to announce!” Lani prompted. What did she- oh. Serena cleared her throat and delivered the news of her sanctioned lordship to her little sister, who squealed in delight and bounced in her seat. “Everyone at the academy is going to be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so jealous! </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Rion keeps bragging because his Father communed another Word last semester, but this will easily overshadow him! Teehee…</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM0OGQ4NDNkZjQ5ZTQyYmFhZWEzMmUwMWRlYjAwOGIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They finished the fruitbread and soon after the main course arrived. It wasn’t a manwese dish, but rather fried choco with a balanced variety of vegetables. It was a dish you could expect to see in Centralis rather than the East. Did her father know about Amelia’s preference towards the chicken-like meat? Probably.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWNjODE3ZWE3MTRiOWE4NDk4ZTM5ZjE0YzQzM2E1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is new!” exclaimed Lani. “Have you ever had this before, Amelia?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTIwYWUxMTBhMDRlMWM4NTI4YmNhYWRlNWY1MWMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia elegantly placed a forkful into her mouth. The illusion of etiquette fell apart when a rather un-ladylike moan escaped her lips, making Serena sigh and Lani giggle. Despite the mistake, Amelia pushed through and simply declared her compliments must be passed on to the chef.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDVkODQ3YjYzOTQwZDY5MTc1ZDY1NjU2M2E5MGRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Small talk continued through the main course. Father appeared to be content with probing only lightly, something Serena was thankful for. One lapse in judgement and Amelia would blurt out, well, something </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia-like</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWE4NmExMzhkZTQzZGZhOWQ3NGRlZDExM2ZiNjYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you thought about what path you would take in the future?” Father asked as the employees removed their plates. “Surely a Speaker of your talents wouldn’t be satisfied with spending years on a military ship?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzQ5Y2NkNGI2YTQyN2M4Zjg3MzcxNjEwYzlhZjA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia eyes shone with excitement. “I’d like to go travelling! I’d like to see the Shattered Isles! I’d like to visit the Southern Terra Firma, where people ride windlizards across the desert! Oh, I always want to visit Centralis and see the skull of the Titan they found!” Amelia punctuated each statement by unfurling another finger. “Also, I want to see the Cathedral of Bone! And then maybe go to the far West and see how they grow loqua berries! Oh, I'm looking forward to going to the North, where…” Amelia continued for a solid minute, lost in her future travel itinerary. Amazingly, she seemed to have remembered every single point of interest in the Empire that Serena mentioned in the last six weeks.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGNkMjg0ZjMxMTQwY2U5NjQ3ZGJlNTk5NzI1ZGMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When her girlfriend wasn’t being a disaster, she often demonstrated a razor-sharp mind that reminded Serena of Nina.</span></p><span class="cjMzM2Q3YWRkY2FlYTQzOGQ4MjRkZjk2YTE5MWIzODAw"><br/>Reading on Amazon or a pirate site?

In my youth, I dreamt about sailing over the eastern sky-rift to unknown lands yonder…” He took a polite sip of the red loqua. “However, after marrying my dear wife, such desires subsided…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzRhMjE5NzdjOTQxNTc4NWFhMmM2ODhhMzhiN2U2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded enthusiastically. “I heard some sailors in Kenhoro talk about it. Apparently, there’s a whole other continent! Full of riches and treasures!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTExMTk5NDYzMjQ3YmY5YTA3NjM1OTliMzI4OTA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really!?” Lani piped up. “Riches and treasures!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmEwMTUyNTkyZjQwMGFhZWIyMWFmNWMwZWM2Y2Yz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! And not just new lands, but entire new races! Like dwarves!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGI0NzcwZTMxMjRkZDZhNWQ2NTdlYzgxODBmMzVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-dwarves!? What are they?” Lani turned towards Amelia, raptured by the fantasy and caught up in the whirlwind of Amelia’s enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTgxYmU1MDFmNDQxYzM5NzcwODE5YTNhY2RmNWEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re a race of shorty, stocky people who live in the earth and mine all day!” Amelia explained with a cheeky grin. “They’re expert craftsmen who can produce jewels and weapons that are far stronger than anything humans or demons can make!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2E5MGYwYWI4MjRlYTg4NDJiOTgwNDA2MTMzODY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-whoa!” Lani exclaimed, eyes widening. “I… I want to go there! I want to be an adventurer! Dad!” She turned, her eyes wide like a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">peeka</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> begging for more food. “Dad! Buy me a ship and a crew! I want to explore the unknown lands!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTY4ZGJjYWZkZjQyOTBhMDNjYWRlMTllMzg0MWY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Father began, prompting Serena to roll her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWJmYTlkYmY1NTRmMGU5MTRjMzQ0N2FkNDVmNmIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No one’s buying </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">anyone </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">a ship, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">are they, Father?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjE3MzNiODdhNjQ5MDJhN2ZkMzJiYmIyNjE0YTcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh… no, of course not. Lani, stop asking for preposterous things!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjdiMGIwNjc5MjQyMTk4OWUzMDYyNzFkOThmNDQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Boring…” Lani muttered, crossing her arms. Her sulking didn’t last long, as she turned to Amelia and asked, “Hey, do you have a boyfriend!?” Amelia looked surprised for a moment, before glancing at Serena with a mischievous glint in her eye.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGM1YWJlMTExMjQ5MjNhYmRjMTFhOTc5NmU2NzY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Be careful, or I’ll punish you later,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena communicated to Amelia with a hard stare.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGRhZTNmNDA0OTQ3OTdhOWYyZjgyMGM2NTk0NDNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mmm! I’ll enjoy it! </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Came the crimson-eyed reply.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDRlY2Q2YzdmMzRhYzM4MGNiYWIwNzIxYTY2ZmMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don’t!” Amelia replied, “but… you could say there’s someone special…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWRjYThkYjZiYzQ4MTA4MjZiM2E2MzlhNGEyYWZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who… who is it!” Lani almost yelled as she moved into full teenage gossip mode.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWRmNGE1NTAzZTQzMThiMTU0ODhmOGVlYTNiOWI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I couldn’t say…” Amelia said sheepishly. “Although, I can tell you they-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTkyNDA1N2I5YjRkY2ZiYTI5ZTJmMDc4ZjRhODhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah!” Serena blurted out quickly, cutting Amelia’s sentence in half. “Dessert!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDAzMDViNmIxMDRiZTI4Y2ExMzIyYmIxMzUyMzA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!” Father called out. The pair of them quickly formed a firm alliance to end this line of Lani-questioning. “Lani, it’s your favourite! Cheesecake!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjhiMTU1ZWNlYTQ2MDU4M2U1N2E1M2RhZmQ2YTFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cheesecake?” Lani replied with a frown. “I like it, but it’s not my favourite…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTdmNTQzYzA4ZTQ2NTM4YmEwZDI1OTU0MDU4MDhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it not…? Oh, that’s right, it’s Nina’s favourite…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmFkY2NiNjQ1MDQ5OTliNTdjNGNhNTljMmNjNzli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk! Stupid Father!” Lani crossed her arms, looking away dramatically. As the critical blow sent her father reeling, Serena smoothly moved into angry-big-sister mode.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTIxMGVlNzU4MjQzNDRiNTFjOWFkZjE5YjhjNDU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lani! Apologise!” She barked, glaring at Lani until her little sister shrivelled and muttered an apology. How much was Father spoiling her! Not only did she need to talk with Lani about alcohol and talk with Amelia about all kinds of stuff, but now she was going to have to lecture her own father!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWI3MGI3ZTFlMjRkOWY5OTY2OWFkZDhmMzNhZGM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">If only Mother were here,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she thought quietly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjkwMDc3OGQwZTQ4YWJhN2UyNWQwZDM5NWJlMTk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They ate the cheesecake in a contemplative silence, until Amelia piped up with, “Actually, there is one thing I’ve been thinking of doing…” She paused until everyone’s attention was focused on her. “Given my capabilities as, you know… a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">healer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I was wondering if it were possible for me to visit hospitals and similar locations?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDJhMGZhNzBlYjQ1OGFiYzAyYTkzMTBiZDY4ZDM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Visit… hospitals?” Father queried.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWY3OWM1OWIxNzQyODA5NmRmZTU0MDUyZmQ4M2Rj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! You see, I have quite a lot of aether and can heal a decent number of people, even without Speaking,” Amelia said, wiggling awkwardly in her seat. “So I was thinking if I could arrange to visit local hospitals with the greatlords of each city. I don’t mean to make it a public event or anything! I just think it’s a little unfair to have all this healing power and not use it…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzdlOTkwZmQ3YjRiMjliM2FmOGYwNzNjZmVkMjAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s mind quickly churned over all the possible scenarios such a path would take, and unsurprisingly, they all ended with her clutching her horns. A side glance at her father told her his mind was also coming to the same conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjgwNWNlYjExMDRjYjlhOWVhYmU4YjhkOTZiYzU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Such a thing…” Father began, “would likely end up painting a target on both your own and Serena’s backs. It would upturn the political structure of Cascadia. Demonkind has no gods of healing, and if you became a saint of the East, which you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">would </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">if you undertook such a path, it would lead to an internal conflict between the territories.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTk4MWU1ZTVhMTQzNjg4MTAyNmQzYWQ4MjUwMzQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So it’s not possible?” Amelia asked with a dejected expression. “Is there any way it could work?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTFjOTlmOGE4YzQzYmU5OGQzOWMyMGY3NjA5YzUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Something like this would need to be sanctioned by the Empress.” Both Father and Serena glanced at the painting on the wall. “Only then could it be done without triggering chaos. And for that, you’ll need citizenship. Speaking of…” he turned to address Lani. “Lani, would you retire for tonight? I have matters of import to discuss with Amelia.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDNlOWMyNDM0ZDQ1ZGViYWM4M2FlNDVmMTM2Zjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But…” Lani protested but quickly quieted down, seeing the combined stare of both Serena and Father. “Fine… 'Night everyone! Amelia! Tomorrow I’ll show you around the gardens, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTZiODQ4YjJmNzQ1YWI4ODI3MDhmZGZjNGE4ZTM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay!” Amelia flashed Lani her characteristic thumbs-up and the little sister bounced out of the room. When she was gone, the house employees cleaned the table and Father had one of them fetch him a thick brown envelope. After they left he handed the envelope to Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzMwYTYzMGEwYjQ1NjRiYmE2ZjA3N2RjMzFkZThi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An offer of Cascadian citizenship,” he said plainly. “As a Speaker, you’ll also become a Lord-Prospect should you accept, which is why there are so many documents. You’ll have to understand and memorise many regulations and laws.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmM3ZjVlNmU0MjQzZDZiYzYzMGZlZDRlZWZjZGI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Great!” Amelia chirped, flipping to the last page. “Where do I sign!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDBhM2Q3MzE1NDQyNjc5OWE4ZTNjMjhhYTZhMDFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk!” Serena clicked her tongue, barely withholding calling Amelia an idiot. She snatched the documents from her and began flicking through them herself. “Don’t sign anything until we’ve both read and understood it fully.” She turned to Father. “Was the Dragon involved in writing this offer?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmU3MDM0NTMxOTQ4NjQ4MWZlOWY2OGUxM2MxNWQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahem,” her father coughed into his hand. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord Corvus</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. You know how he dislikes being called the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Dragon</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. On that matter, there are two things; firstly, yes, he was instrumental in the construction of the offer. I think you’ll find it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">extra generous</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as consideration was given to Amelia’s exceptional talents.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDY4ZTYyYjc0ZTQ1YTA4ODFhZGQzNDU4ZDhhNWE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe…” Amelia smiled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjlhZWY3NDk0NDRhMDZhOWIwMmEyNTAxN2ZiNTYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Secondly, he’s arriving here tomorrow, so be on your best behaviour.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTFjODIxNDliNDQ5NWU5ZGRlYjZkZTY3N2NlYjdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Dragon’s coming to Shimashina?” Serena struggled to keep the dislike out of her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGE2NjcyNjE1ZTRlMzA5Y2E4MmZlYTk5NTg4MzMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, he’s already in Shimashina. He’s coming </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> tomorrow. He’s coming to give you your new orders. Orders </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">which-</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” he continued quickly, seeing the protest forming in Serena’s mouth, “come straight from Greatlord Oshiro.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmJlM2NkZTE4NjQyYTM4Yjk5YWIyNjNhYmFjOGQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...I see.” Satisfied, Serena began skimming the papers and as she did so, she realised how tired she was. She glanced at the wall clock. It was eleven minutes past eleven. “I’ll go through this tomorrow. It’s getting late, and we’ve had a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">long</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> day.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTViMGQ4NzI3YzQ0NDc5MzYzNDlmYzNmMjI3MTdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah? Oh, of course!” Father stood up. “Amelia, your company has been a pleasure. Did Lani show you your room?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjIwZjUyYTU1MjQ5ZDlhZGNmMWJjMTYyNDFmODM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah!” Amelia said, “It’s really nice, thank you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTViMThmNjQxNDQyNmNhNWI2YTY0NjNhOTBjNmY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I shall leave you both and retire myself. Highlord Corvus is expected midday tomorrow, so please ensure you’re available at that time.” He bowed in Amelia’s direction before excusing himself. Just like that, they were alone. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWFkYmEwZDRjNjQ1ZDY4ZjJjMzcwN2Y4NzU1MzBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a few moments, neither of them said anything.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGU5N2M0ZGQzZDRiODM5MDgyYjYyNGU5ZWY5MTFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Citizenship!” Amelia blurted out. “Hehe! They offered me citizenship! I can’t wait to accept!” Unable to contain her glee Amelia jumped from her chair and spun around the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGZhMjI0YWEwYjQyMWE4MzVkOWViZTkxYTg2MTM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re going to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thoroughly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> go through this tomorrow morning,” Serena declared, standing up and approaching Amelia. “Right now though, I’m honestly exhausted. I just want to sleep. Shall we?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzQyOWFiNGE5NjQ5NzA5ZjU4ODg5YzY0MzA0ZjNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded, and Serena led her upstairs. Amelia’s prepared room was opposite her own. They lingered in the hallway awkwardly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTdmMGEyZWZkNjQ3YWJiNDQ4YTFkNDIzYTE4NmYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…” Serena began before being cut short by a tight embrace. They held each other in the dark corridor for a dozen seconds.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjkyNDNkMTI1NTRmZGZhOTRmMTMxMWIzNzk2ZGVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does he know?” Amelia whispered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGQzMjViOWU3NzQxMzk4OWE1MTRhYTRjNTBiZGYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Serena whispered back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTI5YTA3ZDAxNzRiY2I4NDZiMTk3M2ZmMWJjNDkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He seemed… okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmI3NzM1N2IyOTQzODc4YjVhYTE5ZmI1ZTBjOTI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s a pragmatist. He knows fighting it wouldn’t solve anything.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTRhMzVlZDE4NjRlOWI5YmI3OTRjMjhjYzQyZWVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did I make a good impression?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjBkZGU4OGVjZDRhMTZhOTYzMWQzNGNjNjJkMTI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena softly laughed. After everything, it was these matters that Amelia cared about the most. “I think so,” she said, rubbing Amelia’s head. “We should sleep… we can’t linger here too long.” If a random house employee appeared, it would be a little awkward.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjA1YWEyZGE3ODQ1MzlhMmRlMDQyYWUzMTQxMjAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Different rooms?” Amelia asked quietly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmYxNzU2MTgxMjRkZjg4MmU5NjVmNzE4YjJlYjU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Afraid so, best not to rock the ship just yet.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmEzMWM3MmFjZTQzMzRhNmUyZWU1YWJkM2I0M2Yx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay…” Serena felt the cool touch of Amelia’s lips on her neck. “Goodnight, Ren.” As usual, the sweetness of their goodnights calmed her mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDZjMjQ2MzUyNzQ3NTk5Mzg5Y2M1ZTY1NzQ3M2Iw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Goodnight, Lia,” she said, giving Amelia a small kiss on the forehead.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODUyMzQ1ZDY2NDQ1NjNhOTVjY2IyNTM2NDI1OTQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a final squeeze, Amelia pulled away and they both retreated to their assigned rooms. Serena changed into her night clothes while her senses told her Amelia was doing the same. She clambered into bed, hearing Amelia follow along in her own room. Soon, Serena was breathing softly while the house became quiet and dark. As the night stretched on, the aetherlights dimmed, and only the subtle light of the blue moon blanketed the house. Eventually, while she lay there on the comfy mattress, she realised one thing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDM5NWZlYTg2YzQzZmFhNTdjZWI1OWZhOTE3YTc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She couldn’t get to sleep!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTJlZWFkYmQzYTRjNGViZjQ4MTk0NmI2MDNkMzE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Without Amelia in her arms, the bed felt empty and cold! The room felt too quiet without the sound of Amelia’s soft breathing and gentle heartbeat. Serena sighed, turning and trying to force her mind to rest. If she had any talent in the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaxai</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> branch she could cast a sleep spell upon herself. Surely she would fall asleep eventually, after all-</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODNkZGU1OWFiZjQ5NGJhYTJjNzM1MjY2OTJiNjhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, what was that?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzhkODFmMzQ0ZjQzNDM5YmI1MTM5ZWEzZDQ0Nzcw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The distinctive sound of rustling from Amelia’s room, followed by a small yawn and the pitter-patter of feet. Amelia’s door opened and closed as quietly as the woman could manage. A few more footsteps sounded, along with a creaking floorboard. Then, the smallest of knocks on the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzFkYzIwNzA1ZjQ3NzJiYzFhOTAzMTVmNzkxMWY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena sighed in resignation. She climbed out of bed, strode over to the door and pulled it open. Beyond which was a yawning Amelia with fuzzy bed hair and a sleepy expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzBiMzhhYmNlNTRlZTU4ZTRjMDQ0NmVjYjdjNDNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry,” she began. “I just can’t sleep with- </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">eee!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Amelia squealed as Serena pulled her into the room and shut the door. Before Amelia could say anything, Serena bent down, picked her girlfriend up and carried her over to the bed where she was placed under the covers. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTc1MjE1YWRhMTRmY2JiZTM2ZmM2OTU1NzY1MTc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Make sure Lani or Father don’t see you in the morning,” Serena commanded as she clambered under the sheets and pulled Amelia tight against her. “Now, no talking. Let’s sleep.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYThiOGNiMjJkMDQ1ZmM4YTRhNjFkZmMwY2UyNTk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay!” Amelia whispered frantically, placing a hand over Serena’s and wiggling so she was comfortable. She didn’t have much room to manoeuvre as Serena pulled her tight against her body, her face nuzzling Amelia’s neck. It wasn’t their usual sleeping position, but right now, she simply wanted to feel closer to Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjkzNGU5MGE3OTQzMmNiZTNhOGI5OTFhNDlhMmIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took a while, but eventually Amelia’s breathing slowed and as it did so her heartbeat followed. Serena could feel the rhythmic beating through her hand and focused upon it until half an hour had passed and she was certain Amelia had fallen asleep.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2EyYzFlYzZjOTRlNWE4ZjEzYWE3NDQ1Y2MzNmNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, she could say something she had only come to admit to herself recently.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2Q3YmE3MWQzNTRjZmM5MzZiZGYyNjY3MDljMjgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… love you,” Serena whispered in the quietest voice she could manage. Her whisper faded into nothing, and Serena thought that would be the end of it until she felt Amelia’s heartbeat triple its speed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGM2ZTc2MTkwMDQ2MGU5OGI1MTRjNzRiNGM4ZmVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena let out a soft groan.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2ExNWEzNjlmODRlZTg4YTMxZjAwYTYzZWQyOTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...You weren’t asleep, were you?” she asked softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmJiZGRmNTRiMjQxZDc5ODYxN2FlYzFmNzAwMDMy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope!” came the reply, thoroughly dripping with glee.</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Thirty-Eight: Chesterfield</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNhODgzNTgxNWUzZjQ3ZjBiZTgwZGZhMDQ3NzIwZjk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjdkNWZjOWI2ZDRhMGI5N2FiZGE2ODk0NzE0N2Jm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia blinked awake in the embrace of Serena’s arms. She was warm, cosy, and wanted to do nothing but lie here for hours listening to her girlfriend’s cute snoring. Serena, of course, denied snoring </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">adamantly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Her snoring had become yet another tool in Amelia’s ever-growing repertoire of things to tease Serena about.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTQzY2YyMmE1MTRjNTRhZjM0MmJmOWZmMGZiMDRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia stared at the creeping morning light bathing the room for a few minutes until the sound of footsteps reached her ears. They were too energetic to be a servant and too light to be Dalinar’s, Serena’s father. There was only one person they could be.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODkyM2Y1YWU3ZTQwZTNhZmI3ZDNhNGQyNTVkNTRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lani!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGRhODM3OTMxMzQ4MjBiYmFlYmQ5ZGRlYWFlMmE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the footsteps made their way down the hallway, Amelia elbowed Serena awake. “Lani’s outside,” she whispered, prompting Serena to sit up frantically. Despite the situation, Amelia couldn’t help appreciating Serena’s bed hair and how the light bounced off her horns.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGNiYTFiYTEzMDRhNThhNDk0ODMxN2Y5MTA1MTg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A knock sounded, not at the door to Serena’s room, but at the door to Amelia’s room opposite.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGY4ZWEwNzk4MTRmN2I5OTUzY2VkYjUwZGUzOWEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia! Let’s have breakfast!” Lani said cheerfully. When no reply came, Lani tried again. “Amelia? Are you awake?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmY0NGY0ZGY2NTRiNzZhNTEzMDljMWE0MGEyNzdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bloody hell! What teenager got up this early!? Amelia turned to Serena and quickly mouthed: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What do we do?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Unfortunately, her normally reliable girlfriend seemed at a loss and simply shrugged back at her with eyes wide in fear. Although Amelia didn’t think their relationship was anything to hide, she understood that perhaps this wasn’t the best way for Serena’s little sister to find out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODY2Nzk0NTViOTRlODM5MjZjZmFkZDZhZjFlYTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m coming in!” Lani chirped and opened the door to Amelia’s room. “Huh? You’re not here…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWFiMmI4YWY5NDRhMjhiYjhiMWE0ZDFjMTg3NDc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hide! </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena mouthed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTAzZTExOWUzNjRhZjA5YWY4ZDAwNzQzYzMyMGU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia raised her palms upwards, widened her eyes, and shook her head quickly. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODFjMGMyZGMxMTQ0N2E5ODFkZWU3N2M2YmY3MzVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Where!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> She mouthed back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2RjMTQwYTlmYzRmOTI4YTk1YWE3ZDYxOTA3MTQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">More footsteps and then a knock on Serena’s room. “Big Sister? Are you up?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWM5ZWViZGE2NDQxY2U4MDhkMjA3OGU0NThkYWUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia scrambled out of bed, trying to be as light as possible on her feet. Where the hell was she going to hide!? There were no side rooms, the bed was too high off the ground, and for some reason, this was the only bedroom in Cascadia with no large wardrobes to hide in! She turned to Serena and wiggled her head to say, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s nowhere to hide!</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkNjk3ODg1YTA3MDQxYjVhMWMyNmI1NWJjNTgxMDI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Door!” Serena whispered as loudly as she could get away with. Amelia looked at the door and then at Serena with a tilted head of confusion. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the door!” Serena hissed, and Amelia finally twigged what she was getting at. Darting across the room, she stood behind the door in the corner. Amelia was light on her feet but not light enough. The noise of the creaking floorboards encouraged Lani to open the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWVlNjUzZWQ5NDRjMjY4NmJlYzk3MzI3Y2JlMTIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which she did, just as Amelia got into her position. “Big Sister!” Lani called out, standing a few feet into the room. Amelia was hidden against the wall, the open door hiding her completely. Thankfully, Lani was lax regarding etiquette for her family because if Amelia remembered her lessons correctly, leaving a lady’s bedroom door open was impolite!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWUyMTJhMzhmYjQzMzA5M2M0ODU4NTMwNmFhYzA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lani,” Serena cooly intoned. Amelia couldn’t see what was happening, but from the rustling sounds, she could tell Serena had propped herself up against the pillows. The sound of paper being flipped reached her ears. It seemed Serena had grabbed the citizenship documents and was pretending to flip through them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWMxODAzZDM2NjQ4NTVhMTI1MzU4YTIwYzcxMmQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning!” Lani said in a sing-song voice. “Where’s Amelia? She promised she would help me with my workbooks!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWNlNzI0YjFlZjRmYmRiN2MwNDJlYTYyZDQ5YWNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You woke up early to do </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">homework?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Serena said doubtfully. “Lani! If you’re looking for Amelia, I heard her heading to the kitchen for breakfast. Go find her there.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2M1NTM3OGFiYjQzMjNiMWQ3NTkxOWRmNDhjODdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Lani mumbled, “I just came from there…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGVlMjdkMzg1NTQ0MzM5MGExZmQ5MzkwMTU2YjRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then you must have just missed her. Now, I’m </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">busy, so if you could…” Serena trailed off and Amelia could sense the glare that punctuated that sentence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjZmMGI2YjU1MDQyZTQ4NjBiY2ExZGNhMDI0YmIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boo! Boring! Bye!” Lani bounced out of the room, pulling the door shut behind her. Amelia stayed utterly still, like a frozen hare. She and Serena looked at each other while listening intently to Lani’s footsteps disappearing down the stairs.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Mzg2NWZmOWFkNTQwMjU4ZjgyNzEzMjE2OTZiODM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once Lani was gone, Amelia broke out into a grin and Serena soon followed. She delicately hopped over to the bed and began putting on her clothes. “That was close,” she whispered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjIyMmQ0MTM1ODQxYzY5OGY1N2JkNmExMzg5MjEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I swear,” Serena said, shaking her head. “She never gets up that early. You promised to help her with her work?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjY5NTY1NTk1ODQ4NGY5YmMwYzVmYzU0NDMxN2Q1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I spent an hour yesterday finding out exactly who has a secret crush on who at her academy,” Amelia said with a smile. “Being a teenage demon sounds </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">exhausting!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> I was going to pull my hair out until she mentioned the workbooks! She struggles with mathematics, and that’s my favourite subject!” Amelia finished dressing, and a quick burst of cleaning magic left her clothes and body feeling fresh. “I’ll head down,” she bent forward, kissing Serena. Then, not entirely satisfied, she gave her another, longer-lasting kiss. “See you there?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDRmN2E0Y2JlNzRhNmNiMTk5MmFlMWY1NmJhMTEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk!” Serena tutted, but her rosy cheeks suggested she greatly enjoyed Amelia’s affection. “I’ll be down in ten minutes...”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjdjNTE0MWQzMDRhNjJiMzljYzVmMzg5ZDQwNDMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Waving goodbye, Amelia bounced out of the room and down the stairs. “Hello!” she greeted an old maid cheerfully. “I’m looking for Lani! Which way’s the kitchen?” The old maid bowed and offered to lead Amelia, which she accepted. Amelia was once again impressed by the politeness and professionalism the house employees displayed. She wasn’t sure why, but she had expected snide comments whispered in secret or glances with traces of dislike and distrust. There had been nothing like that. Amelia made a mental note to ask Serena about it later.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDRhMTEwOTRhMTQ0ODdhYTBlY2YwMGYyODU1OTlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They arrived at the kitchen, and when she entered, all the employees stopped what they were doing and bowed to her. It was a little awkward, and Amelia wasn’t sure exactly what to do, but Lani rescued her by taking control of the situation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWQzZDExMWFhMTRiM2U4ZWYwNjc5M2MzZGQwNjM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning! I’ve been looking for you!” Lani exclaimed, grabbing Amelia’s hand. “You promised you were going to help me! Let’s eat!” She dragged Amelia over to the head chef and listed off several dishes. “Come on!” Lani pulled her to the dining room from yesterday, where Amelia was surprised to see Serena’s father already seated.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YThjNWVkMWUzNDQ0NmNiZDY4YzBlM2M5MGY4NGJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Speaker- I mean, Amelia,” Dalinar said, correcting himself quickly. “I hope you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">slept well</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWExY2IyZThiMzQ3M2VhMDI5MjhhMmU1N2E5NDI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia awkwardly returned the greeting, wondering how much Serena’s father knew about last night. Well, she would just power through any awkwardness like usual! </span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup! Thank you for your hospitality, Dalinar!” Amelia beamed and sat down in the same chair as last night. Lani quickly followed and began bombarding Amelia with everything Lani wanted to do after breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWI2NTc0NjhkYTRiMjVhMmRhMTI1NjdiNzMwNTcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lani,” Amelia began when the girl had finally taken a breath. “I have to spend this morning going over documents with Serena, and then at lunchtime, I have a very important meeting.” Lani’s face dropped and Amelia quickly added, “However, afterwards, we can hang out for the rest of the day! Maybe we can go through your workbooks in the garden?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTk5NGQ1NjZkNTQ0MGNiMGJhYTEwMDU5NmJmNDQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay! Do you promise!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTE3NjcxYmJmYzQ2MjFhYjcyMDgzZjVhNjY2ZTMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course! Here, pinky promise!” Amelia curled her pinky finger and held it out. Lani looked at it as if she didn’t know what to do. Amelia mentally slapped herself. Once again, she had forgotten many things native to her world didn’t translate well here. “Here, copy me. Give me your pinky finger.” Once Lani did, Amelia grasped it with her own. “This is a pinky promise. It’s an unbreakable vow between two women. I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">promise</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> we can spend time later, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTc3NGRkYzQ4ZTQ2MjY4OTY4OTJmZDIzMWEyNWQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe… okay! Pinky promise!” Lani announced happily and Amelia suddenly had a dreadful feeling that pinky promises would soon be a widespread thing amongst the gossipy teenagers of the academy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDk3OTJhZDUyMzQ0MmFiODYzMDgxMjMxMzZjMzJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before any more awkward moments could happen, Serena appeared. She was dressed in her military uniform and once again Amelia was taken aback by how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">striking</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena could be. Her girlfriend exuded a natural feeling of command and confidence that Amelia could only hope to emulate.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTEwNjM4NDFjNzQyNjVhOGY2YWM4MDFlZDQ2NTdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Father, Sister, Amelia,” Serena greeted each of them before sitting down. Breakfast arrived, and Amelia found herself eating a tasty fish similar but not quite as tender as sardis. When she made the comparison, Dalinar explained it was something known as a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">springfish</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that was frequently caught in high-sky during this time of year.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Nzk3ZjdkNGEzMzRkODA4ODc3YTU3NDE0MjUwMDRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When did you have sardis?” Dalinar asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmY4OTk0NjhmZDQ3YzZhNWI0ZTlhYjgzYWYwN2Rm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“North of Kenhoro,” Amelia answered. “The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> caught some. It was the most delicious thing I’ve ever eaten!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjQ5MjAzZTYwNjQ1MjFhMWVmNGQ5NDg1YjhhMzIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re so lucky!” Lani chirped with an envious expression on her face. “The fishermen can’t get it here due to the ban!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODE4YmM0NTI5OTRiYjJhOGQ2NGUyNzhjY2NlNDQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ban?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODlmMWE4NGJiNjQ3MmU4OGYzNGZhNDlkMWEzYzJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The nearest schools of sardis fly about two hundred klicks south-east,” Serena explained. “That’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">far</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> too close to the Shattered Isles. The arcwhales are protective of their feeding grounds, and no fishing ship will risk a five hundred meter behemoth ramming it out of the sky.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODY0MzRlMjI0ZTQxN2I4OWQxMzcyNWM2YWY0ZmRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoa." Amelia struggled to imagine a creature of that size. The one she had seen in the skies north of Kenhoro was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">only</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> three hundred meters, and that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">dwarfed </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and sent the crew into a panic. “How big is Rhaknam?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDhiNDEyYTMwMzQ1MGZhMWM1ODY1ZWYzNzkzMjJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Serena looked up thoughtfully, “He hasn’t been seen for a while, but I remember reading about a sighting in the eighth century, about sixty years ago. Then it was said he was a little over </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">two kilometres</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> long.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTBmNDNjZmI2NDQwZmRiOTJkZmY2MGI1ZjJhODk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s ridiculous!” Amelia couldn’t help blurting out. “How is that even possible? Wouldn’t signals from the brain take too long to move throughout the body?” Serena shrugged and explained that Rhaknam was a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">god,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and things like that didn’t apply to him.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjcwMmEwMWZiODRlYWNiZjk5MTVmZmU2YzgxNzQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What other animal gods are there?” Amelia couldn’t help but inquire, her childlike curiosity getting the better of her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzkxNTJkN2U0NDQ3ZTY5OTNmNGE2ZTZjYTJiZDhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sven</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Winterlord!” Lani piped up. “He brings the winter in the North every year! Apparently, there’s so much snow you have to wear masks or you’ll go blind from the sunlight bouncing off the ground!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2RjZGRmNjVhYTQxOTFiODgwZTFiZThjMjkwOWIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the Southern Terra Firma, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Urlan</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the Greatwurm resides under the blistering sands,” Dalinar explained. “There’s also the Greatspider, although, unlike </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Urlan,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it’s never been seen. Nevertheless, it’s worshipped by the desert tribes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWZkOTBhYjUwMzRjZmM5MzYxMGFkMjdkMTVhOGY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s the Greatspider called?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWE4NzU5ZmFkNTRlZGZhMDUwNjU3ZmY3OWI4NjE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Elana</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Dalinar answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODNkNWYwMjQ4MDQzMjM4YWM5OTkwMjgwMmMyNGZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Elana?” Amelia frowned. “Isn’t that…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2I5YzYzY2YzOTRjMDk5ZWIyMWMxNTZiMWRjMDJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The desert tribes believe the Greatspider is one of the Empress’s forms,” Serena explained. “They hold that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Urlan</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is her husband, and together they have spawned the many other animal gods they worship.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2U2ZTlhYzcyMjRmMzliNDllZDI4ZTExZDc4NDZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For the briefest moment, Amelia’s mind turned to how a giant spider and worm could procreate. Then, she caught herself and quickly pushed the disturbing images out of her mind.</span></p><span class="cmQzNzE2NWRmYjkxYTQ5N2U4OTcwNjEwODAwNjllYTZl"><br/>Love this story?

<p class="cnM1ZjllNmM2MzYzNDQ2Zjg4ZGM0NTEyYzU3ODUzMWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent warriors,” Dalinar said, sipping his tea. “The tribal demons. Not quite the society I would enjoy, but it has a certain simplicity to it.” At seeing Amelia’s confused expression, he explained, “The southern nobility is entirely defined by strength. Any position can be challenged at any time.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDc5YzdlNDI0MTRlNjNhN2VkZWRiOWJkMDlmNGUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even the Overlord?” Amelia inquired.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjFiMTk2NDIwODRlNmRiNjE5ZmU3MDgyOTM4M2Nh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even the Overlord,” Dalinar clarified.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTU1YjI5ZThiZjQ4ODE4ODdkNzYxMjJlNmY0ZWNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Back to the animal gods,” Serena began, looking suspiciously at Amelia as she changed the subject. What did she expect Amelia was going to do, challenge the southern overlord!? “There is, of course, the mysterious </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Orr.”</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> At Serena’s words, her Father chuckled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWU0NDUyNzQ4YjRmMTQ5MDJjZjVkMWI4NTVkODZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” Amelia questioned the reaction.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzc0NTMzNjNmZTQ1MjU4YjBiZGUyYzVmZjMwMmU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Orr’s </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">nothing more than a nighttime story for fathers like me to scare our misbehaving children,” Dalinar explained. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Orr</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is the hypothetical </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">being</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> responsible for the ever-lasting great storm system north of Cascadia and west of the human continent.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjljYWI4MWE5NzQ2MDY5ODAyYTI0MTA4NTNiMDI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not just any storm; it’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">two thousand</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> klicks wide, and any ship trying to break through has been destroyed,” Serena explained. “Under our weather models, it should be impossible. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Something</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is providing the energy for that storm. Besides, there are rumours…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGNiZGJmYjk3NTQ1NzA4MTE1NGUwODZlOTQxNThm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rumours!?” Amelia sat at the edge of her chair.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzEyYzhiMDIzNjQzOGJiNWU0OTI1NjQwZDY5ZDY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A terrible shadow, seen within the storm.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjk3ZjFmZDQ4YzRjM2JhNmE2NGE0MDRkMGIyYzRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sailor’s tales,” Dalinar said dismissively, “Superstition. A fantasy worshipped by the priests of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mur</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjkyZWJmZWRmZTRiYmI5ZDFmZmIwYTY2OGFkY2Q1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mur?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmIwOTI3NTczYjRmNDhhZWM2MzQyZjg0MGM0MDkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Just west of Karligard, of course,” Dalinar answered softly, meeting Amelia’s eyes with an indecipherable gaze. Oops! Amelia slapped herself mentally. She </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> seen </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mur</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the maps Serena had shown her. She’d spent so much time memorising the locations of her supposed journey south that she’d forgotten about the neighbouring kingdoms in the other directions!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjIyMTc5Y2UzMzQzMDU5NTUwOTcwZDNiYjY2MWVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes. Of course…” Amelia muttered, scratching her nose awkwardly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzRjMzdlZWQ1YzQ5NDg5MGVlNzRlNDYxZTYzMWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it’s time we went over these citizenship documents,” Serena said plainly, casting Amelia a glance that instructed her to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Stop talking, idiot! </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Father, can we use the study?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTA5ZGRkYjYxMjRiNzVhNjdiMDU0YTgzNTYyZWNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a problem. I have some work to do myself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjlkM2I3YTQyODQyNzg5NzZhNmI4ZDg2Mzg4NWU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With breakfast over, Lani was ushered away and the remaining trio headed to Dalinar’s study where Serena cleared out a space and began going through Amelia’s citizenship documents. Dalinar’s words from yesterday rang true; the documents were quite generous, absolving Amelia of specific responsibilities that would expose her to too much Cascadian nobility.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTBhMjNkYTA0NDQ5Y2FhYTU5MzM2NmE0MDM0MGVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looks like they still want her to take the oath ceremony next year,” Serena said, looking up from the papers and casting an eye across the study towards Dalinar.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzhmOTMwYjI4NDQ0NTc5NmYyMWY1YTA4ZThiOTY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. Plenty of time for Amelia to become comfortable as both a citizen and Lord-Prospect.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzQ5MTRjNzZmMzQ5NjM5YjRlMjI0ODExOWVhNmVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s the oath ceremony?” Amelia asked, glancing at them both.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Nzk5YzE1N2I3NzRlYTU5OGM0ZDNkZWQxZmRiMDkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Every four years, any new nobility are required to travel to the Capital to swear oaths before the Empress,” Serena answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODgwZTc1ZDc5YTQxMTNhYzZkNTJkZDJmYzI5OGY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Every four years? Why so long?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2Y2MDM0MmI0NDQwNjBiOGRhMTliMzg4MzBmNDVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A holdover from pre-airship travel. Before, making the journey needed a tremendous amount of preparation. Now, you can hop on a cutter or take a train.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTM4NWYwYTk0MzQzMWJhMWVlMzJlNDBhNmRlOTlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there a problem with me taking the ceremony?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTY3MmU0MzEyNDRlMDY4ZGVhNWQzNjc0YzYyOTY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No… it’s just…” Serena sighed, casting another look at her father. “Occasionally, the Empress will request a private conversation with one or two of the oath-takers, typically newly-crowned Greatlords or other powerful Speakers. With you,” Serena jabbed a finger at Amelia, “You will almost certainly be pulled into a room for a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">private conversation </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODJkMjlhMTMxYzRkNTNiNmNjYWU5ZWE1ZWE5NDcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cool!” Amelia flashed a thumbs up. “I bet she’s really nice!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmY0NTA1ZjJiYzQ3NjBiYzhjYjkzNTQ3MWJiN2Nm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is…” Serena muttered with a frown. “Entirely the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wrong</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> way to go about it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGE2ZTgxZTQwNDRlOWVhNjRlMTA3NWJmMzY0YTRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, Serena,” Dalinar said from his desk, “You’ll have plenty of time for Amelia to learn all the required etiquette.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDA1MTJiMGQ3YzRhMWE4MmQwMjI4ZDcxYjk1MDYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...I hope so,” Serena said, returning to read the documents. The minutes ticked by, and eventually, she put the papers down with a sigh. “That’s it. Surprisingly, there’s nothing hidden. It looks okay.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDJjODg4ZTM2MzQ0YjM5OGRhMmJjNDZhNDAxNmJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Awesome! Can I sign it then!?” Amelia grabbed a pen and eagerly looked at Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmFlZjE0NGZjZjRhY2M5NWFjODIxNmIzMzdmYzgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...I don’t see why not. You’ll need your signature here, here…” Serena flicked through the papers, “... and here.” Amelia quickly scribbled her signature at the required locations before placing the pen down.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzUxNGM1NmZhZDQxMzI5Y2IwMjUzM2RmZjc4YTlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All done!” Amelia exclaimed. “What now?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzE3YmEwZWNlZjRiMzBiNmUyOTA5ODdhZjY0ZTg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now you’re a citizen and noble of Cascadia,” Serena tilted her head in a slight bow. “Lady Thornheart, may you serve your overlord and the Empress with all you have to give.” Serena paused, looking concerned. “Maybe not </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">all</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you have to give; I don’t think the Empire’s ready for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">all that</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTJjNGQ0OWRjNjRmNzc5YWE5MGQzMzllMjdkMDRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Congratulations, Lady Thornheart,” Dalinar said from behind his desk, “I imagine it won’t be long before we’re calling you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Thornheart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzlmMGRkY2Y1NDQ1YjFiNGZiOTNmOGI3MGVhMWM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe…” Amelia grinned nervously. “Thank you!” Before she could say anything else, the door opened, and the old butler called Johan appeared.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDAxNTBjMmMyZTRiODk5YTA4NDMxODk0M2M0YjFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Highlord,” Johan announced to the room. “Highlord Corvus has arrived with a guest.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWJmNGM0OWVhYTQ4ZjNiN2E2NTJhOGJmMzE0ZmRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah!” Dalinar stood up. “Lead me to them. Serena…” He turned to Serena. “I’ll bring them here, so be prepared.” Serena nodded and began adjusting her military uniform, her face suddenly becoming very serious.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWIxN2I3OTExNDQ5OGU5NDNlM2YyZmIxMWI0ZDYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After Dalinar and the butler had left, Amelia asked, “You’re nervous around the Dragon, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjBlYmYzZTZjODQ5NWNhOTE5NDRkOTRhNjMxMDhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk! Obviously,” Serena mumbled as she fiddled with her hair. “The man’s a snake, and like the most dangerous snakes, he has his own goals and has the power to pursue them. If the ship didn’t prevent him, he would have put us both in chains and, more likely than not, attempted to hang one or both of us.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmN2Q0YjIyNTZhYzRlMDBiOGE4ZmRmNjVkZTIyODQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Amelia thought quickly. “I’ll try not to say too much then; let you take the lead.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjJkNTIxYjQ0ZTRmOGM5YTM4YzZjNmIwNmRhYTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perfect, thank you, Amelia.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTA2MmY4MmE2ZjQ2ZmQ4MmVjNjE0YWE5YjcwZDQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded happily. “You’re welcome.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzY3YjJmNDRkNDQwODY4MTVhNzhkMzEyY2NkZmMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>

<p class="cnM5NDVmN2YyYzMxMTQ1YzQ4Yzk5Yjg4NjQ2OTZkMjU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena had just finished adjusting her uniform to be perfectly straight when Father appeared with the Dragon and another man shortly behind him. When they entered, Serena swore the temperature of the room dropped. Once again, she was reminded how accurate the man's moniker was. The Dragon was crowned with at least six sets of horns, some of the most prominent Serena had ever seen on a demon.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjU0MDI5NzcwNzRjZjliMzNhMTk3ZTUxYTFlY2Zi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The plain-looking man who followed the Dragon was practically the exact opposite. Where the Dragon’s presence dominated the room, this man seemed unassuming and unthreatening instead. His horns were small stubs, a horn-type found in some areas of Centralis, and his face was plain, neither attractive nor unattractive.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWJiNmFhMWI1ZjQ3NzI4YjNhNzJlYzg4ZTU1NGU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Intelligence Officer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGZmYWZkZjIxMDQxZGI5ZDc0MjI4YzU1Njk4MmNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Halen,” the Dragon intoned as he stepped in, his deep voice filling the room and sending shivers down Serena’s spine. “And </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lady Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I see you’ve seen fit to join our humble Empire.” Amelia politely returned the greeting, and Serena quickly followed suit.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmViOGM0NDcyYzRkNzZhMGQ5NWQ2ZDg2NDE5NTE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please, sit.” Father gestured to the prepared chairs, and the Dragon and his guest slowly sat down. Serena, Amelia, and her father quickly followed. An awkward silence passed before the plain-looking demon spoke up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTZkZGYyYTRkNDQ5MjQ5M2JjMTBiNDgxYTM4N2I1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some tea, perhaps?” He requested with a smile. Dalinar quickly rang a bell and a moment later an employee appeared. The guest raised a finger. “A pot of mint tea, if you have it.” The employee bowed at the request and vanished. “I’ve always preferred conversation with tea,” he said to the room. “Having something to do with your hands makes those awkward moments almost bearable, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmY2M2EyODI2MDQ2Njk5NGVlM2IyZjk5NmQ2OTUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No one seemed to know how to reply to that statement, so Serena simply resigned herself to silence. She noticed that the Dragon’s guest was carrying some kind of case, which made her uneasy for some reason.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjMyN2JjZjY3NjQxZmQ4MTNlN2FmODYyMzA4MDAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A suffocating eternity later, the tea arrived. While they held their cups in polite silence, the Dragon eventually began talking.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTA1ZDM3MGQ5YjRkM2FiMzM3MGNlNmNjMDQyYmE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have matters of import to discuss,” he said. “This here is Mister Chesterfield, a representative from Centralis Intelligence. He will explain some of these matters, as they are beyond my paygrade.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWZhYzY0MWJjZDQyYzQ5ZTk2NTA3ODRlY2JlNDI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh? Now, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">was interesting. As far as Serena understood, there was very little </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">beyond </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">the Dragon’s paygrade. Additionally, he had referred to his guest as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mister</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, not Lord or Speaker. Who was this man exactly? He didn’t appear to be any kind of mage or warrior.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmNhNDY5MGI1NDRiODZhMjNlMzIxOWNiZGM2NDJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A pleasure to meet you, Lord Halen,” Chesterfield said, tilting his head in Serena’s direction. “And a terrific pleasure to meet </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Lord-Prospect Thornheart.” He smiled at Amelia for a period of time that was just a little too long to feel natural. “Now, before we get onto the more serious stuff…” Chesterfield glanced at the Dragon, who pulled out a small box from about his person and passed it to Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2VhOGQ4NTc5YTQ1NmJhZDA5NjAxMTJiNjg0NTVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She took the box. It was a little larger than her fist and covered in black cloth. On the top side, a familiar symbol was embossed in gold. A crown wreathed by horns. The emblem of Cascadia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTZlMTI3ZTQyYjQzMTE5YmUzOGY5YWNjNTNlNDQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Open it,” the Dragon instructed, and Serena did. Within the box lay a bronze medal with embossed silver. “Your bronze eagle,” the Dragon explained. “For your exceptional work capturing Port Highwind. It would have been silver if…” His eyes narrowed. “...You hadn’t ended up losing control of your Word and battling the commander of your ground forces to near-death.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTJlMDExZTdmZjRlMTE5OTIxOGQ1NGM4YmNhNzNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt a flash of annoyance but quickly quenched the feeling. After all, the Dragon was correct. What happened in Port Highwind </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">her failure; it was a miracle she hadn’t been dishonourably discharged.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2QwYjY3OTdkODRiMjk5ZTJiNzAxNDJkMDJlMzYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Highlord,” she uttered with as much sincerity as she could manage. “It’s a great honour.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmIzZjNkNjA5OTRkNDVhYTkyZDVlOGFhYzQwNWY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord Oshiro also offers his congratulations and wishes he could have been here to hand it off personally.” The Dragon said. He produced a cigar and lit it, inhaling and exhaling slowly out his nostrils. Now, he really </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">did </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">look like a dragon. Serena couldn’t help but wonder if he did it on purpose. “Speaking of the Greatlord, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is being pulled out of the Eastern Fleet.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWViZGYxNzJlOTQzNDk5MzkxNGY2OGZhMzliYmI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Serena hissed, unable to control her displeasure at the sudden subject change.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDBhNTRjNTcxMDRhMjc4ZGI2NjcyMDUyMjZiNjZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">know,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is leased to the Eastern Fleet on a contractual basis. That contract has ended, and Greatlord Oshiro has not sought to renew the lease from the Centralis Navy.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjgxYmFlZDBlMjQ4ZDc5ODljOTRiN2IwY2M0NWJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re taking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">my </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">ship from me?” Seeing Chesterfield smile at her words, Serena struggled to keep herself calm and threw him a piercing glare. He held her gaze, and eventually, Serena looked away.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjE2ODE3MGIzZjQ4NmI5MTNmNTcyNmM5Y2FlNDI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, no.” The Dragon puffed his cigar again. “The ship has taken a liking to you, and as you know, without the consent of both parties of the original agreement, the Captain of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> can not be removed so easily.” Another stream of smoke out of his nostrils. “You and your crew will remain with the ship. You’ll be doing important work, taking on missions directly from Intelligence. Chesterfield will be your handler, through whom your orders will be given.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTBjZTU1MjgyYzRiZDBhZThiOTA1M2QxOTllNmU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would like to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">protest</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena said with as much force as possible. She didn’t want to be passed so quickly from Greatlord Oshiro, a man she respected, to some nameless face from Intelligence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWE5ZTFjOWY4NjQ2YmRiODhhMTg0NzVhYmNmOWQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahem,” Chesterfield coughed into his hand. “The instructions for this… shuffle come directly from the top.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGQwZjA0MmE1ODQ0MzhiNGZhMjM4YjgyY2JhODhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The top?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmNjNDA2NzgyNTQyZmU5NWY4NzhlNWZhNzhjYTMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Empress herself has commanded it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTcyNWM3ZTY2MTRkNjA4NDNmZjliMGRiNDI0MTM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena bit her tongue, swallowing loudly. She forced herself to slow her breathing. “Then, I accept,” she finally said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDM4NzZlYTg0NzQ3ZjhhYjA4NjI1MjY3ZjcxNDc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent!” Chesterfield clapped his hands, turning to Amelia. “Lord-Prospect Thornheart, am I correct in my understanding that you intend to keep following Lord Halen, your employer?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmVhZjdjOTg3ZjRiMTM4MjkyYWQxZmMxOTI0MDk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm…” Amelia glanced at Serena. “Y-yeah! I’ll follow her!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmYzOTE1MmY0MjQyOTg5ZjNhOWQyOGJiOThjOWI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Terrific!” Chesterfield’s face broke into a warm smile that seemed genuine yet entirely out of place considering the atmosphere. “Now then.” He turned to the Dragon. “Francis, if you could…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTBiZTVhNGViZjQzMzJhZDAyNzA5N2FiNjMzNmEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sir.” The Dragon nodded before standing up and gesturing for Serena’s father to do the same. “Highlord Halen, could you show me around your spectacular gardens?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2EwYjI5MGY4YzQ4ZWQ5NDU1MGM4NWU1ZWJlOWE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh? Yes, of course!” Father stood up, his face looking a little confused. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjdjMmQyYzQ2YzQ1NjY5YmYyYWFkNmFmODIxODY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dragon politely nodded at the room and the pair of them exited, leaving only Chesterfield and his easy, out-of-place smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzBmNjQxYWY4ZTQ0MWY4NTY0MjZlZjcwMDAzM2Mx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who are you?” Serena asked, raising an eyebrow. “You’re not some paper-filing, pen-twirling middle-ranked Intelligence Officer. You’re high up, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjdkZTY2YWE3ZjQxNzliZGUwY2U0YTA5MTY2MWZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quite high up,” Chesterfield said softly, sipping the mint tea. “However, when you’re as high up as I am…” he looked at Amelia briefly, “...you come to understand there’s always someone greater. Well then…” Chesterfield opened the box he had brought with him. From within, he pulled out two more boxes. One was about ten inches in all directions, while the other was about as big as Serena’s medal box.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2I3ZjcyZDFkNDQyYmQ4MGVmM2UxZTNkN2E5MjVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The smaller box made her instincts scream. Whatever was in there couldn’t be good. Chesterfield brought his hand to the lid of the larger box, hesitating. “Would you like to know what the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">really </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">is?” He looked at Serena with a tense expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDEzMzA3Mjc4MTQzYTQ5MjI2MDdkMjcxZWU2MWVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“... Yes,” Serena finally answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWU5NjE5ZWQxYzRkMWU4Mzg3OGQyNjY3MTc0NjNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wonderful,” Chesterfield said, opening the larger box and pulling out a human skull and placing it on the table.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGVmNzg0ZDFlNTRiZThhMmY1MWI3MDVkMTY1OWEx" style="margin-bottom: 2em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anathor, could you join us, please?” </span></p>

<p class="cnM4ODE5ZDRkZDVjNDQ2NDZhMDM4YzJiMjQ1ZDJiM2M2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzI3NTc2Mjk3MDRhOWQ5MmFjODI0MjBjNThhMTZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena vaguely sensed a disruption in the aetherfield before the skull's eyes glowed red, and a familiar gruff voice spoke out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzE1YWY2ZTk2NjQ0NzM5ZGJiZWI5NjFlMWI4YjIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… Captain. Miss Thornheart,” Anathor intoned in greeting. Serena opened her mouth as a question formed but quickly closed it. Anathor </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> once told her he could leave the ship if he had to, but it wasn’t a good idea as the ship would begin to behave strangely if he was gone for too long. As captain of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena had never known Anathor to leave.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTJlYjFiNGZhZTRjZTY5MzVmM2NlYTQzMjkyMjI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, not to her knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzI3Zjk2NGU1MjQ4MWRhNjkzNjE5YjM5OTM1Y2Nh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No greeting for me, Anathor?” Chesterfield said with a soft smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjkyYWE5YTEyNDQzYWU5NGNlMjYyZDEzNGQ2ZDY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… hello, Chesterfield,” the skull eventually mumbled after a long silence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGNlMjNhNjJmODQxZDliNGQ4MmQ5YjNiOGM4MDQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before we begin,” Chesterfield announced, spreading his hands wide. “I hope you don’t mind, but it’s important that we record this conversation, so…” the demon reached into a pocket and brought out an ornately-cut moon crystal sitting in a small box. Unlike the other box on the table, which gave her an ominous feeling, this one was immediately recognisable. She used the same device to record her initial interrogation with Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmE4ZDRmZTQ2YjQ5OTdhZDYyMTAxN2E5NmU4NjA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">An Axiom Crystal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTAyMTM5ODM4NDRkZjdhZDQ0ZmE4OTRjNjEzNDE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesterfield placed the device on the table and twisted the activation crystal. With a small click, the crystal began to glow a gentle blue as it passively recorded all sounds in its vicinity. Casting a suspicious glance at the Intelligence Officer, Serena reached over and picked up the device, examining it from all angles.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODYxNDgwMDdkYTRlZGRiNjlmZjJiOTM1ODEwMmRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can be at ease, Lord Halen. There’s no truth-telling crystal being used,” Chesterfield assured her with a disarming smile. “It was considered but eventually decided to be too offensive a strategy. Besides…” his smile widened slightly, “I’m more than capable of telling if someone’s telling the truth. It becomes second nature when you’ve been doing this as long as I have.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTcxYzUwZWIyNTQ5OGM5YzM2NjBjNjQwZTk4NGI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Satisfied but remaining suspicious, Serena returned the Axiom Crystal and glanced at Amelia. Her girlfriend must have sensed her concern as she said, “Other than that device and the aetherlights, the only other crystal in the room is whatever’s used in the locking mechanism of the safe hidden behind that painting.” Amelia gestured to one of her father’s landscape paintings on the wall.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGJmMjk2ZjVkNjRiZDBiZWRkOGQyOGQzZmM1Zjc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Additionally,” Amelia continued, “I can’t sense any blessings on this man. Still…” Amelia glanced at Serena and then Chesterfield. “I don’t intend to tell any lies, but I might refuse to answer some questions.” Amelia held Chesterfield’s gaze calmly. It seemed her girlfriend was made of sterner stuff than Serena was. Something about Chesterfield put her on edge. The man wasn’t a mage or warrior, and he didn’t seem to be warded in any way, yet something felt </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">off</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTk3N2JlM2UzYTRjOGZhNTBlYzJjODk0Y2Q1OTRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, now!” Chesterfield announced cheerfully. “This is already getting off to a wrong start. This is no interrogation or underhanded way to investigate you two. All that’s already been done, thanks to my wonderful subordinates. One of which you’re familiar with, an…” he raised an eyebrow, “...Officer Adachi?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTUxNWM3NzIxZjRjNzBhNjhlNjhlMmIyYzM1ZWQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I meant no offence,” Serena said smoothly. “I, as well as any Captain worth their horns, know full well the games Intelligence plays. The last game of which would have killed dozens of innocent civilians if Amelia wasn’t there to heal them.” She tried not to glare at Chesterfield but nevertheless found herself giving him a hard stare. His behaviour and attitude were disarming, much like Amelia's. However, unlike Amelia, this man had none of her naivety.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDJmMWRmNGMwZjRlNTE4MmZiZTc3MGEwY2ZjMDhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A very dangerous demon.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWIxMjQ4NWM2ZDQ0ZDM5OGI1ZjlkOGY4YWYzMmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is understandable, and what happened the other night with the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakamoto</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was an unexpected consequence of a rushed operation. Speaking of…” Chesterfield gave Amelia a polite smile. “Lord-Prospect Thornheart, your continued supply of aether over such an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">enormous</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> distance to maintain the ward you’ve placed upon Miss Volkova is, while a brilliant testimony to your talent, causing us significant problems.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmYxYjYzZTQ4ODRlNGU5NmU5NWVjYWQyNjc2MzUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not only is this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">river</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of aether causing continued interference with our early warning aetherscopes - a vital part of our strategic defence - but it is also interfering with the arcwhales' yearly migration, whom rely upon the natural aether flows to navigate south to the Shattered Isles. I kindly request you cease this particular spellwork.” Chesterfield finished his sentence with a delicate sip of his mint tea.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODQ2MzBlMWJiNDQ5NWRiOGZkMGMzNDlmZjhjMTYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia didn’t reply immediately and Serena wasn’t sure if she should speak for her or not. On one horn, Amelia’s naivety and tendency to just power through every problem meant Serena often found the urge to jump in and prevent possible escalations. On the other horn, Amelia often demonstrated remarkably sharp observation skills and an ability to approach serious topics maturely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzAwZmY3YWQ1MjQxZjg4NDMwZTk3NzcwOWRkN2My" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“... I can do that,” Amelia eventually said. “If I write a letter to her, can you ensure she reads it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzc3YTQ0NzdkOTQ2MmFhMjI0MmQ3NDA1MzNhOTJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Certainly.” Chesterfield nodded. “Please understand it will be read beforehand to prevent any </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">accidental</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> slips of intelligence. I’m sure Lord Halen here will be able to aid you in its writing.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjU5Njk5OGU1MTQyOWNiZTI5YzY0NWQxZjM0YTZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded slowly and a moment later Serena felt the flow of aether that had been pouring out of Amelia for almost two days now cut off.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDBhYjI2NzcxZjQ1ZTFiNjVlZGJkNWVlMDM3NjM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent. Thank you, Lord-Prospect Thornheart. Now…” Chesterfield took another polite sip of the mint tea and turned his gaze to Serena. “Where were we? Ah, yes, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. How long have you been its captain?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWM5ZjRjMWRlZjRlYTQ4NzY4OTQ1MTgyYzMyMGY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nearly four years,” Serena answered, glancing at the skull's glowing eyes. She knew Chesterfield would already know this information but played along to move the conversation along.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTExODYxOTQyMjRlOGE4YjFmNjcyNTNmZTY1YWEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And what information regarding the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> were you given after it chose you to be its captain?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzcyMmQyZTA0YjRkNjNiY2FjYWIyYTNiMTZlMTNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena frowned slightly. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was one of the few subjects she’d refused to answer Amelia’s prodding questions about. If Chesterfield was asking these questions now, then a decision must have been made to permit Amelia to hear the answers.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGY3ODg2OWZmZjRiYjViNWY5YjcwYjQzMzk4NGEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An anomaly. A living ship with a damaged soul.” Serena glanced at Anathor. “With a Formless guardian, forever bound to the ship to protect it and its crew.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjk1YmIwNzQxZTRiZTBhZmI0ZGQxNjIzZTU3ZTVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… my noble duty…” Anathor quietly mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2RkNDgxMWUzMjQ5NzJiYmY4ZjA4NGYxMWQ5NWIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesterfield nodded. “A good summary. And what of the fourth deck? What were you told regarding that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODQzNTY5OTE4YTQzMjg4Njg4YjliYmJkNzAzOTNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena glanced at Amelia, feeling a little guilty. When the fourth deck had been brought up previously, she had lied and told Amelia no one knew what was contained within.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzgxN2YyZTI3NzQwOWNiOTVhMWNjNzRmNGY2NjZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A protective shell,” she answered. “Containing the damaged soul, in a form that must never be released unless…” Serena hesitated as she remembered the words once carefully explained to her. “Unless the ship's capture is imminent, or the destruction of the enemy is of cataclysmic importance.” Chesterfield nodded. Serena looked at Amelia; instead of seeing any annoyance at being lied to, her girlfriend was on the edge of her seat with the same excited glint in her eyes that she always had when discussing any mystery.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTIxMzczMzM2OTRiY2E4ZTFlZDgxNWQ0MmE2Mjk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A simple and accurate summary, Lord Halen,” Chesterfield said. “However, a little bereft of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">whys</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hows</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Tell me, have you never felt the urge to investigate further? Anathor tells me you never truly tried to pry any further secrets.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGU0ZWJiNTIzYTQyNDVhNzJmNTQ1OGNhMDAyOWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena shrugged. “I had my duty, and that was enough for me. Besides, a living ship isn’t that unusual. The South uses stone golems for work, and the North has ice spirits. It wasn’t a difficult thing to accept.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGY0MTNlNDZlNzQyMjNhMzdkZGE5ZDJjNjJmNDQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How very reliable. If half our captains were as straightforward as you are, the war would be over already,” Chesterfield said with an amused smile. “I’m here to unlock more of the puzzle, as the knowledge is required for your upcoming duty. Firstly, I have to clarify a few things.” The demon took a sip and, finding it empty, frowned and poured himself a refill.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWQ1ODFjOGRhZjQ4YzI5ZDc3NTdiMzUxYjg4ODY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The information you will receive is classified at the highest level. I will later clarify what you can pass down to your officers; if I do not explicitly sanction it, then it’s only for your and Lord-Prospect Thornheart’s ears.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzZiMDJiOTdhZjQ4NDBhMTQxNzliZGQ3NjBjYTVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia is not part of the military,” Serena clarified. “Why is she involved?” She sensed Amelia cast a longing look at her but resisted the urge to turn her head. Instead, she did her best to hold Chesterfield's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzljOWEwMDg5MTRlN2RhMDFlNGIwMDE5MmY3MWVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, she is not. However, this task is something only you can do together. The combination of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Lord-Prospect Thornheart and yourself is a unique arrangement. This task also falls under her obligation as Cascadian nobility to protect the Empire from its enemies…” Chesterfield’s expression slightly twisted, as if he had eaten something sour. “...Domestic and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">foreign</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGE4MTdlODljNTQxZGJhYjgwMWUzZDFhOTU4YTQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He quickly recovered and eased back into a relaxed smile. “We cannot, of course, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">force</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Lord-Prospect Thornheart. Nor would we want to, out of respect for her tremendous talent. Yet, as you will find out shortly, we believe, given the reports of her personality and desires, she will be more than happy to accompany you in this duty.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjllMTg3NmM0NTQ1OWNiNTcyYTEzZDM4M2E5OWY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt herself frown but otherwise didn’t challenge Chesterfield further.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmVmNWZiZDQyNjQ3MTVhMjU3Njg0MmExOTg1N2Rl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now. Your summary of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was accurate but a little misleading. Unlike the stone golems of the South or the ice spirits of the North who gain their bodies and souls through a natural process, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was an artificial joining of a ship and a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">splintered</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> soul.”</span></p><span class="cmMzNDkwNzhkMzI3MTQzYjBhZDZkNGJjNTY5ZWMyODIy"><br/>Unauthorized usage: this tale is on Amazon without the author's consent.

<p class="cnMxNGE2NTAyZmE3NjQwZTNiNjllYTU2YWEwNDc1Njdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whose soul!?” Amelia blurted out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTZmYmIzNTE4OTRlODM4MmEwNTVmYmUzMTUxYTdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Classified,” Chesterfield answered mildly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzZiNWQ1Y2MxNjQ0ZGRhMzBhMmU4MWVhOTYxZmY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One moment,” Serena tapped her horns in thought. “I was told the soul was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">damaged,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> but you just referred to it as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">splintered</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. What’s the difference?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjYyNDI1OWI3NTRlZjNhZmU1ZTRiMTc0YjViMDhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! And we arrive at the most important part!” Chesterfield placed down his teacup and clasped his hands together. “A long time ago, it was whole, and then…” He mocked an explosion with his hands. “...then it was many.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWFhMTdkYzQ4NDQzZGVhZjdkZTExYzZhNjY4NGZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Splintered,” Serena said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWMwYWFkMzEzODQ2Mzg5MTQzNDY4NTcxYzcxM2Ji" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Splintered,” Chesterfield echoed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTNmOWRmYjdhZjRhODk5NTY4MjljOGEwOWE5MmNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So it’s not a damaged soul contained within the fourth deck, but a splinter of a larger soul?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzQ0ZTcyNmUzODQzMDliMjA2NmNkYmE1YjE5NmUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Precisely, although a better term would be a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shard</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Normally, a splintered soul would have its shards evaporate into the mists, but the larger shards of this soul are unique and are determined to hang around this realm. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> contains one of the greater shards, which is why the ship has the unusual ability to be unaffected by most lumina interference.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTg2MzAwNGM1NzQ4MmFhYjU1NmQwOTk4YTE1ZjU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena narrowed her eyes. “There are more shards?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjVmN2UzZDZhOTQ2Njg4YTc2ODY3NGIxNDE0Mjhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The demon nodded. “There are. Some have owners, whom we call </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shardbearers</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The remaining shards do not have owners, and it is those which the Empire is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">interested in recovering.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWUwNDFmNmM2NDRiZjA5NzEzZTJiOWQ5OTA1YWRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Nzg5MDYwZmNmMTQzNzdhZDExZDRhYTJhODFjNDVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because whatever unclaimed shards remain, they were large enough to avoid evaporation after the splintering and would have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">crystalised </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">into a stable form by now.” He raised a finger and pointed high up on the wall. “What’s that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzNkODU1MzkxMzQ1MmRhYTZjMGRmN2VmODc5ZWVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena followed his finger. “...An aetherlight.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGQ0OGQwZmZiMzQ1ZDlhZmM4ZmZkZmQzZjg3Zjdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, but in this context, it’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">power</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Generated from a cut </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">crystal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Chesterfield gave her a pointed stare.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzc4ZTQ0NmY3NzRiMWNiYTIxYWI3ZWZhNzY4NjYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re that dangerous?” She asked, understanding his point. “A weapon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGI3NzcxMzZlMDRkYjc5NTZhZDMzMDQ0NmZlMTRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weapons and a whole host of other applications that can be as benevolent as they are devastating. But we don’t want you to sail around the Known World collecting shards so we can cut them, no…” Chesterfield narrowed his eyes. “We want you to deliver these shards to the fourth deck so they can reform and make whole what was once lost.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDAyYWQ3ODdmYTRmYmM5NjIyYmY1YTY4Y2U2MmI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena blinked. She took a sip of the mint tea for the first time and found it was cold. Still, she drank it slowly while running Chesterfield's words through her mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Yjg4MzhjNDM5ZDQyOTk5NWExODkxZGQyYTk4MzE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What was it exactly? When it was whole?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmI1ZWY2Zjg5ZDQ3NTc5YzA4YTBjYzk0ZTQ5ODAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… it was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hope</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Captain,” Anathor answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjJjNDM3ZjM4ZjRmYmM4YzdlODljMzcxODBkZmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena turned towards the glowing skull and raised an eyebrow. “Hope?” she asked. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTRjZmJkZGQzNzQzYWU4NmRiZWQ1ZDJlNGQ5NDgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When all was lost, a desperate plea was made…” Anathor grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmJlMzBkMGM1MzRmNzRiYmQ3Y2I1NjFiMmI4Njc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anathor…” Chesterfield intoned, his voice taking on a note of warning.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjM2MGE2ODEyNTQ5MTg4MmRmYjRhMzIzMjI1M2Y4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… a cardinal sin…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTdhZGYzMTY1YjRiZTJhNDRkNzllNTc5MGZkNjlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anathor!” Chesterfield exclaimed, rolling his eyes before smiling apologetically at Serena. “Apologies, Lord Halen. For the security of the Empire, much of the information regarding the shards is given on a need-to-know basis. You understand this, yes? You would not provide your squad commanders with all the details of an operation lest they get captured, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWVkN2ViYjY5NjRjZjM5YTk4MTRkZGI1NmZiZWZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena nodded slowly. In the military, it was well understood that any information you were given from your superior was what you needed to know, and any information withheld was withheld for good reason. The same concept equally applied in Intelligence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzliZDRkNTkwNTQwMGFiZmY5OGFmYWRjMjUzYmZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I hope you can forgive my frustrations about why Anathor…” Chesterfield eyed the skull with a smile that, for the first time, had the subtle curve of a hidden predator. “Decides to ramble on, forgetting what is and isn’t important.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Zjk1NWI2Mjk3YzRjMDdiOWIxZjUyYTNhZGE5M2Zm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… I do not like you, young Chesterfield,” Anathor grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTJjYjI1NzViODQ0ZmZhZWU5MDcxMmUxMGYwZjI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why us?” Serena said, interrupting their bickering. “If these shards are so valuable, and the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> owns a large one - why risk it sailing around the world? Why risk it in combat? Why not send the Empress’s Lord Guardians or Intelligence Operatives to collect them?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTUxZmFkNTVjNzRhZmI5NzA5YmM1NWI0OGUzOWEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So many questions…” Chesterfield mumbled. “We have had some success with your suggestions, but the larger a shard is, the more difficult it is to find. One thing we have learned is that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shards</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> can find other </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shards</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. This makes sense, of course. A splintered soul would desperately want to reform itself. Therefore, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> can find its brethren. As for why we use the ship in combat…” Chesterfield smiled softly. “There is a war going on; why wouldn’t we use the tools that give us a distinct advantage?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmZkNTQwZTYxZTQzYjU4MzY5OTllODM3YmFmYTRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena suspected this was only a half-answer. Still, she decided not to press further. “You said earlier that Amelia was part of the unique combination that makes this task possible. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> can find other shards, and I’m its Captain, but why Amelia?” Serena glanced at Amelia and found she was nodding along.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWZkYWJhM2NiZTQ4OTk5OTQwNGY4MmQ3NDE2ZjVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s rather simple,” Chesterfield began with a gentle smile. “Lord-Prospect Thornheart is a powerful Speaker with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">exceptional</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> perception. On top of that, she has no significant obligations, such as having a city or territory to manage. She is free to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">roam</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She has also expressed the desire to travel and experience many new things. With that, and considering her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">loyalty</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to you, it seems a natural fit, does it not?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGEwOTRiN2VmYzQ4YTZiODI3ODgxMGE5YWYyYzU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, mmm!” Amelia nodded enthusiastically. “I agree!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODRlNGEzZmZiMDRjYzY5ZmEzYTgxNzZjZDk2ODUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena resisted the urge to roll her eyes. “So where are these shards, then?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWM3ODkzZGIwMDQ2MWQ5MjEyY2VjZDU3NWQxNzhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An excellent question, and unfortunately, I don’t have the answer.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzE2MmZhNzUzMzRlMjViMTVlMzdlMTBmODc5ZDY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good start,” Serena grumbled. Chesterfield appeared to find her annoyance amusing whilst Anathor chuckled softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTBkYzQ4MTlhZjQ0MGNhNWZjOTkxN2ZkYzBiM2Mx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have threads we can pull. Areas of interest. Locations which have demonstrated unusual characteristics. Shards can have… varied influences on their environment. For security, you’ll have one thread to pull at a time. I hope you understand.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmU0NDQxODcwMTQ0OTU5MjFkOGU5MzdiZTI1OGE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena narrowed her eyes at the mild-mannered demon. “And you’ll be our handler?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGM2OTQ5YWEwNzRiODlhMTE4ZjJmMjBiYzQ1MGUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… I don’t want you on the ship…” Anathor quietly mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTliN2I5YjlkZjQ3NTRhNDJiM2YxZTE3N2I1NDYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see we’re of similar mind, Anathor,” Chesterfield said with a smile. “I will not be joining you on your adventures. Unfortunately, I have no end to pressing matters I need to address and therefore I cannot leave Centralis for long. Officer Adachi will join your crew and act as our line of communication.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGJjZjNmM2E0NDQwMTBiZjg0MmYzYjRjMjFkOWMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Aiden would be joining the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">crew? Serena felt a small smile coming along. During their time in Kenhoro, she became somewhat accustomed to the infamous drunk and found herself missing his silly antics. Still, one Intelligence Officer would hardly bolster their forces.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTBjYWQzOTRiMzQxY2RiZGY1ZjViNDhiMWZhMWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My ground forces?” Serena asked. “They were disbanded by the D- I mean, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord Corvus</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Are they being reinstated?” Serena was a talented Speaker and Amelia was at her own ridiculous level, but two Speakers can only be in two locations simultaneously.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWI2MjJlNzQ5NDQxODA4YmUxYTlmMDljZWU5NTE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes,” Chesterfield took another sip. “A decision has been made. It was a difficult problem to solve. The presence of Lord-Prospect Thornheart is problematic, and we don’t want another assassination or mutiny on our hands. Considering your destinations will likely take you outside the Empire, we cannot let you take a battalion with you. International conventions prohibit such actions.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTA0NDU2ODI0OTRkM2VhMDI1ZDUxMWI4YjZjZGM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We believe forming an elite squad of capable warriors and mages is the best solution. It’s important that they are loyal to their Captain, with no pre-existing bias towards working with a human Speaker. For this, the best option is to recruit from the upcoming batch of graduates directly.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Nzc1YjQ3YjA1YTQ4MTFiMWUxMGQ2MzJiMmNjNTll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjIyOTEzZGJkNzQyZTlhNWY5YTQ5OWNlNzk4ZDAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No more than a dozen. Each one either orange-aura or second-circle at a minimum. It would be a formidable force, even without you and Lord-Prospect Thornheart backing it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGMzZTIxZjk5NzRmYzlhNzFkMDM4ZGE2N2QwOTYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where from?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2VjOGY0ZjQ2YTQ0MGZiMjkxODc0MTkwYzk1ZDE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Asamaywa Academy.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjZlYWY2MDljOTQ2NjE5NDBkMjE3OWJhNTE5OWI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt her eyes widen. That was the academy she graduated from. Her home away from home. “When?” she finally asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWMwOTQ5ZjYwNzQ4NWU5ZjYyNmRjZDdhNjZhMDhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The last semester begins in two weeks. The arrangements have been made already. You’ll be a guest instructor, training the second-years before graduation. Also…” Chesterfield gestured towards Amelia. “We would also like Lord-Prospect Thornheart to join the class. After all, one of the most important traits you’ll need to uncover is the willingness to work alongside a human Speaker. Furthermore, Lord-Prospect Thornheart’s participation in the magic and aether classes would be greatly appreciated, as her perception and intuition will help identify talented mages who are comfortable working with her. She’ll become a teaching assistant for the Head Mage.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGI3YzE1MzIxYzRjYmVhMTFmMDkyMzY4ZjAxNmQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, it also gives time for Lord-Prospect Thornheart to become better acquainted with demonkind. The experience will be beneficial for her as well.” Chesterfield punctuated his sentence with a sip of tea. He then placed the teacup on the table and reclined slightly, resting his hands on his knees. “Any questions?” he finally said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWExYWIxZjNlYjQ3YTRhZTcxYzk1Y2FhZTg2ZjJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I’m going to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">school!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Amelia blurted out. “Magic school!?” Her crimson eyes were wide with excitement and she was grinning like an idiot. “I can’t wait! This is going to be amazing!” She turned to Serena, nodding happily. “Let’s do it!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmJiYmFjMmM0OTQ3OWU5NjQ4Mjk1NTRmYzE2MjZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena couldn’t help but smile at the familiar optimistic enthusiasm. It was only a semester, and it was an opportunity for her to experience the nostalgia of returning to the academy where she had spent so many years training. Thinking about it some more, she felt her own excitement grow. She could show the Grandmaster how far she had come since graduating. What would he say when he saw her sword now?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGE2MWEwNDIwNzRmMzE5MDlkMmVlMDY0NjQ4Y2Fm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, the Asamaywa Academy possessed proper facilities for Speakers to train in; Serena could use them to get a firm grasp on her recently achieved blue-aura.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzZkYWY1MTA3ZTRmMWJhYzNmMDk4YzA5MTU4MzA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was, however, one thing yet to be addressed. Something that had been gnawing at her instincts for a while. Serena gestured to the small box on the table. “One question. What’s in there? A shard?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODRhZjg5ZjIxMjQzMTVhMTgzZWRiMzFkYjQ3NWEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good question and good guess, but wrong. This little box doesn’t contain a shard.” Chesterfield's expression suddenly turned serious, and his eyes darkened. “It’s unpleasant, but you must know the threats you’ll face.” Chesterfield reached over and pulled the small box so it was facing her. His hand was poised above it, ready to open the box.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTQ5ZjhkMzYwODQ0YTI5MzNhMDk1NmRkOTZmNWQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re not the only ones looking for the shards. For nearly a thousand years, the Enemy has also been looking for them. You know them as the Darkblades, but did you ever know why they’re called ‘dark’? Here, take a look…” With a grim expression, Chesterfield opened the box.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmJiNTI5ZGQ4MTQyZjVhNDcyMjM4YTIzZmYyODMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The room’s temperature plunged, the aetherlights dimmed, and Serena felt the aetherfield protest. Her instincts screamed at her. Her sword-hand instinctively went to her waist. From within the box, shadow erupted, spewing over the edge and covering the table in what could only be described as an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">absence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of warmth and light.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzczNTQ2YTA4MDQyZjNiY2VlM2VjYjUxZGE5M2Nm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s impossible…” Serena muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGMyYWM3NjAzZjQ2ODNhNmJkOTdmYWRiZmRjMTFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… A hateful thing…” Anathor grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzg5NzUxN2FiMjQzNmViNjBlYmExNDdiYWFmNDBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Laying within the box was something unbelievable. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTY3OTYyMjYxODRjMzc4OTVhNmIxYzVkNjE3MDIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something of myth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmM5ODFkMjVkMTQ4OWFiYTcyODMwNDdkMjgwNTEw" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">A black moon crystal.<br/></span></p>

<p class="cnNmOTcyZWM4ZDdmMjQ2NWQ4MjZlZTBjOWFkYjg3YjZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmI1OGUxMjQxZDRhMjBiNzQ0ZGFhYjljYmVmMjQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s impossible,” Serena said again, knowing her words contradicted the ominous reality before her. Her heartbeat shot up and adrenaline filled her body, causing her to shake. The black moon crystal made her grit her teeth in anxiety. Strangely, the sight of it also prompted a deep feeling of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">anger</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was as if the existence of this crystal was an offence to all living things. She hated this crystal, and somehow, she knew it hated her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWVjZjQ1Y2E4ZjQ1ODRiMzFhYWI5ZDVlYTlkY2Ji" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weird…” Amelia muttered, shuddering and rubbing her arms.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTQzNzYyNWZmOTQwNDU5NzgyNGE2ZGQ0OTg5Mzdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… never gets easier…” Anathor mumbled. The ethereal shadow spreading from the crystal could not reach the glowing skull. Whatever abilities Anathor possessed, it was enough to prevent the corruption from getting too close.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmUwM2ZjZjEyNzRkYjQ5M2JkY2UzZGM3ODlhMGZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here,” Chesterfield said, reaching over and picking up the crystal with only the slightest bit of hesitation. “It’s uncomfortable but not painful,” he explained, holding it out to her. Shadow spewed from the crystal and covered his hand, frothing over and falling towards the ground in slow motion. It also crawled up his forearm as if seeking to cover his entire body in darkness.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWVhZDFhYTRjZDQ2M2I4ZDdlZGMyMjM5OGY1ODI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before she could decide whether she wanted to ignore her instincts and accept Chesterfield's offer, Amelia’s hand darted out and snatched the crystal. Amelia didn’t seem affected by the shadow that quickly consumed her hand and crept up her wrist. Instead, she examined the crystal as if it were an intellectual curiosity, turning it this way and that. Serena sensed Amelia's aether flare and the shadow retreated back into the crystal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTlhMjgzNTViNjQwYjc5ZTA0YzliNGJiM2Q0ZTY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It reminds me of…” Amelia muttered. “...Antimatter.” She looked up and made eye contact with Chesterfield. “What happens if this touches a normal crystal? It won’t explode, will it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTgyMWY4YmQxMjRkMGFiNDA1MGFiMjlmZmM0ZDc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesterfield shook his head. “No, but it’ll cause an awful amount of aetherfield interference.” He slowly looked at both of them. “The Enemy has been using these to create a new type of aetheric-warfare ship.” His eyebrows narrowed. “What’s antimatter?” he asked, returning his attention to Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGJlMDcyODJlZjRiNWY5MzUyNzM4N2NkYjdiODA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Something that explodes,” Amelia answered dismissively. “You know, I’ve got pretty good aetherfield perception, but it wasn’t until I Spoke the Second Word I understood how life and crystals themselves bend the aetherfield into themselves, much like a planet bends spacetime.” She bounced the crystal a few times in her hand, causing even more shadow to gush out. “But this is the opposite. It bends the aetherfield </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">away</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I can feel it trying to push my wards open. How strange… It’s not an aggressive action; it’s just its </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">nature</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to resist aether. Yet… it feels so…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTcwMzUzZDI4ZTQ1NzI5OGI3ZjRjZWQzNTkwMzZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hateful,” Anathor grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWFlODUzYmU2ZDRkYzk5NTZmOWI1MzY0MDY3ZDJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s really going to get along with Nina,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena thought. Her genius sister rambled and murmured theories exactly like Amelia sometimes did. Despite the almost unbelievable level of advanced technology Amelia had informed Serena about, all of it seemed like it would be impossible to re-create in this world with the lumina interference damaging electrical circuits.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGY5YWRiMWYyYTRlMTE4NmIzMzkyNWJlMzRhZWI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if anyone could do it, Nina could.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTU2MjMzYTg0NTRiZWY4NDhhNmFkYjI1MTAwNjll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Try it,” Amelia said, holding the crystal out. “It’s safe. My wards on you will hold.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGU5ODg1ZmQ4ZTRhYmQ5YjIzYTVkOWYzMTBiZWQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena reached out to take the crystal, a small smile forming as she realised that Amelia had snatched the crystal first to ensure it wasn’t dangerous. Honestly, who was supposed to protect who? Well, they could protect each other. That didn’t sound too bad.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDY0NWQ0NDQ4MDQ3ZThiYTQzY2ZmMDhmMTA2Mjgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When the crystal made contact with her palm, Serena shuddered involuntarily. There was such a sensation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">coldness</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lifelessness</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the crystal she couldn’t help but cringe. Chesterfield and Amelia were correct; there was no pain. Still, it was uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2M0OTEzNGU2ODQ2ZTI5M2I1YzE3MTEyOTlmNzE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was shocking was the red-aura Serena kept running at all times </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">melted</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> away from her hand. As the shadow crept up her forearm, the red aura covering it vanished. It wasn’t the same as an attack; her aura wasn’t resisting a strike; instead, it simply became </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">undone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODE3ODEzZGI3YzQ3NTE5ZWNlMDk3NDljMjE0MGYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">just-in-case-a-mountain-falls-on-you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> wards Amelia kept active on Serena held firm. The first ward wobbled slightly, but Serena sensed a little increase of aether from Amelia, and it quickly stabilised. She reached internally within herself and moved her aether, forming the second aura. The orange glow filled her body and even reached up her arm, but the black moon crystal refused to allow the aura to go so far as to protect her hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODE2NTU0OGQ1YzRhNjE4NzBjNDI1MWM5MGQ3ODZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gritting her teeth, Serena churned her aether and moved her aura into the next stage. Yellow hues lit her body and the room as the third aura was established. To her relief, this time she was able to protect her hand. Still, the aura near the black crystal wobbled, trying to come undone. Serena flared her aether and strengthened the aura as much as she could without Speaking. Now, her aura appeared to be too much for the crystal to contend with and the shadow was finally pushed back within the crystal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODlmNTQ2OGQzZDQzODM4YzIyMTNjZjNiNjkwODhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not wanting to burn through her reserves and not wanting to hold this crystal a moment longer, Serena placed it back in the box and closed the lid. She opened her mouth to question Chesterfield, but he interrupted her with a raised finger.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWI0ZTc3ZjIyNTRhN2NhZDRkZTU1NzZhYjA0OWMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a wonderful father you have,” Chesterfield said quietly. “He’s rushing up here now, preparing to Speak one of his Words.” Chesterfield’s statement was quickly validated as a moment later, Serena’s father burst through the study door with his aether boiling and a worried look.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDA4MTA2OWNlNjQ3MTZiZDAwMGMzYzE5ZTNjODc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Serena! What-” he exclaimed, frantically scanning the room. Eyeing Serena and seeing her unharmed, he quickly calmed. “I sensed you flared your aether. Why?” He cast a wary eye at Chesterfield, who had slightly turned to face him while resuming his mint tea consumption with an easy smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTA3NjM2NGMxNTRkYmI5ZjgxOGZlYTIwYjZhYmI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing, Father,” Serena reassured. His reaction was understandable. Forming high-level auras and wards was something not done in polite company, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">flaring</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> aether was often an action taken before a fight. “Just a demonstration.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YThhNGQyMmMyYzRkYjFiNTJlNDBlOGI1NjQ4YWZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…” her father said after some hesitation. He relaxed his aether and Serena sensed the Word he had been simmering fade away. A moment later, the Dragon appeared behind him with his usual expression of disapproval.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjhkNzU4N2I0NTQ4MjBhYWFhNWJkMTJjZWM1OTEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The man ran off before I could explain,” the Dragon grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmJiZDNkOGRjNjQ0OGY4OGU0NTA4NDM0YWQzNDc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An understandable reaction,” Chesterfield said, nodding slightly. “Highlord Halen, could you wait downstairs with Highlord Corvus? We are almost done, and there are some important matters I need to discuss with you. Ah-” Serena’s father was eyeing the box with a wary eye. “Do not worry about this item. It was required to explain Lord Halen’s new orders.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmNkODUwOGZhMTRmNjVhMmQ2NzA1NWRhMzY0M2Q3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena gave her father another reassuring nod, and he eventually left after apologising for the intrusion. The dragon followed soon afterwards. After their footsteps faded, Chesterfield said with a gentle smile, “I suppose what they said about your father is true.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjYwYTdmZmU4MzQ0NWZhYTQ0MDNmNzAwOWIyOWFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s that?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2I1Yjg4OGI4ZTQwM2VhMTA1Yjk1ZjE1ZDdmMDYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That his fierce heart had been cooled by his daughters.” Chesterfield tapped his chest. “A parent’s first duty is towards their children. This has always been true and will continue to be so,” he said softly, his voice taking on a rare note of emotion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTY0ODIyZDI1MjQ1ZGY5MTkxODAyNzc2YWI1YzYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That crystal,” Serena said, fixing her eyes upon the closed box. “It was undoing my aura. Does the Enemy use it as a weapon? Is that why they’re called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Darkblades?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Serena had simply assumed they had that name because they worshipped the dark gods and black beasts that invaded Cascadia a thousand years ago. She didn’t realise the name could be so literal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2Y5ZjkxMWVhZjQxNDc5ZTEwZjgyZTU0Y2Q5MDJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right.” Chesterfield nodded. “Their elite warriors have blades with a crystal edge. A talentless darkblade can get lucky and assassinate an aura-coated warrior with a single strike. An Enemy with talent can endanger even a Speaker.” Chestfield sighed. “And an Enemy Speaker is truly a great threat. As you’ve found out, third-level auras and wards are needed just to resist contact with this crystal.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTFlZDlmMDRjMDQwZTE4NWMzNzZlYWYzODBkMWFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But the Enemy wouldn’t be able to coat their weapons with aura, right? Even if a black-crystal blade renders an aura-covered sword impotent, the impact of the steel would shatter the crystal?” Serena asked, her mind quickly going over the combat implications of the black moon crystal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzlkYmJjZWZmZTRjNTM5ODdiODZmMWY5NzhhMmE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s correct, Lord Halen.” Chesterfield nodded. “They need to make contact with the crystal to cut through your aura. A talented fighter like yourself can still outperform them in combat. However, it’s not </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">only </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">swords that you have to be wary of.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmQzMTMzYTU3NjQ0MWJiZWI5MWQ0NjQ4NmJkNmU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took Serena a moment to see what he was hinting at. “Bullets,” she muttered. “Gun and shellfire.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODVhODNhODFhNjQ0OTRiOTNkZmYxNDliN2E1MzEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly,” Chesterfield said with a grim expression. “A red-aura warrior is resistant to most handguns, an orange-aura warrior is resistant to most rifles and once we reach yellow and beyond, then conventional weapons become mostly ineffective.” He placed down his cup and raised his hands slightly. “However, bullets with black-crystal tips will bore right through a weak aura like it was never there. The only saving grace we have is the disruption caused by the crystal, which isn't instantaneous. It takes a fraction of a second to tunnel through aura, which can be enough time to slow the projectile and prevent it from being lethal, but this relies on the victim being sufficiently powerful in the first place.”</span></p><span class="cjcyYTI4YjQ3OWI0YzQzNTg5MTc1MjE5ZmU3OTYxYmYy"><br/>This novel is published on a different platform.

<p class="cnMzZjE3NjFlOWRiODQzNjI4NzIwMTg1MjgwNzQwODRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is yellow enough?” Serena asked. Her yellow aura at her maximum comfortable output was enough to resist the crystal in her hand, but would it be enough for a black-crystal bullet?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGQ3Mjg2NTBmMDRlZDQ5NDRhNDQxY2ZhZGZjN2E2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“With your talent? Your yellow aura could resist small calibre shells easily enough but would struggle against a proper assassination attempt with a long gun.” Chesterfield shrugged. “Of course, this doesn’t account for the additional protections offered by Lord-Prospect Thornheart.” He gestured to Amelia, who turned to Serena with a determined look in her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjI3MjMzNTQyMzQ5ZGJiNWU5ZWNhZDEwZWU2Yzlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to layer </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">many </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">more wards on you now,” she said, nodding quickly. Serena suspected she would soon discover the difference between what an average Speaker and Amelia considered ‘many more wards’.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDJjMmIzODBiYjRlMDBhY2MxOGJkZDNkYmZhY2Qz" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Amelia,” she said before gesturing to the box on the table. “So, it's real then, the <em>black moon</em> of myth?"<br/><br/>"Yes, but don't ask me any questions about its location. I cannot answer that."<br/><br/>"Well, it's not in the sky," Amelia piped up. Chesterfield's eyes narrowed slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTQxYmU5NDA1MzRkZjBiNDE5M2ZhN2JmYzQxNmRi" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YmZhOWZlNzdkMjQ2YzVhNGEwMDcyMTg0MDE0YzBj" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"How would you know that?" he asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWY5N2I5NDRjNTQ1Yzk5OGJjZTQ1NTI3ZGE0OWQw" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZWYzNzdiMzJkZjQyZDhhOTc1MjkxMWM2ZGYwNTU4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Well, even though it's black, you would see the stars blink out as the moon moves in front of them. Unless it's <em>really </em>small and <em>really</em> far away..." Amelia shrugged. "And if it was raining black-moon crystals down, then we would know about it, right? Unless it's from a land on the other side of the planet... Is it?" Amelia tilted her head with a questioning look.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2E3ZTNhNTRhMjQ3ZjBhMWRhYzExNGI0MjA4NTcz" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YzY1MjgxNTg1ZTRhNTk4MWI2ZDZmZGVkYTUyOGE3" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"... You're quite the detective," Chesterfield answered but didn't elaborate further.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGQ0MTViZDllZjQ0YTA5ZDcxZWM0MjM5ZGNhMTM0" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYTAwNzQxYTk5MjQ5ZGZiMDRlODM4YTZmNzk3ZWFm" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing this line of inquiry had ended, Serena raised her own question. "How many of these are there? I can’t recall anything like it on the battlefield.” She had never encountered a darkblade or heard stories about these black-crystal-coated weapons.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTM5OGQzYzIwZjQyZDNhOWIxN2Y1MGE1NzM4ODIw" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YTc0MGQ4ODg2OTRmMDk4MDlhYzI1Mzg1ZTg0YjQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Most nations are aware of their existence, but like Cascadia, they vehemently avoid using such weapons.” Chesterfield raised a finger. “One, because these things are offensive to life itself, and two-” He raised a second finger. “If one nation starts using them on the battlefield, everyone else will and no one wants their pool of talented warriors and mages to be so easily reduced.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjgzNzdiZjZiYjQzMWM5Y2QxZDAxZjA4NzZjZTYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, while Christdom and its allies are firmly against the black crystal's,” He raised both hands and made the mocking motion for quoting, “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">demonic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> existence, other nations have found some usage. The Federation uses ground black-crystal in their intelligence operatives' suicide pills, to ensure no healing magic can stop the suicide attempt.” Chesterfield turned his head towards Amelia. “Miss Volkova voluntarily informed us she had consumed such a pill, after her assassination attempt against Lord Halen had failed. Of course, such a small amount of black crystal is insufficient to prevent the healing prowess you displayed while under the influence of the Second Word.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWExYmY1MTI4YjQzMzI5NTI3ODI1NzZkZWU1YWY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Voluntarily?” Amelia replied suspiciously.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDIzNDgwYzNkYTQzNzE5NmRkNmVmOTY4NGIzY2Nk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesterfield took a moment to reply. “I see that your concerns about Miss Volkova’s safety have not been alleviated. Lord-Prospect, during your time in Asamaywa, would you like me to have Miss Volkova brought down so you can verify that she is appropriately cared for?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzNhM2M1Y2YyNTRjZjA5NTQ1MDUwYmMxNWYxZTRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I’d like that,” Amelia replied bluntly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDVmNWUwNDhmMjRjNDBiOTYzMzMwNDFjYmQyNDM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then it’ll happen.” Chesterfield nodded, turning back towards Serena. “The aetheric-warfare ships I spoke about have only recently been sighted, but national navies will inevitably copy the designs. However,” Chesterfield clasped his hands together. “After you’ve recruited your fill at the Asamaywa Academy, the first location of interest will be within demon territory. Only after successful trials can we consider sending you further afield. Unfortunately, you should expect to encounter darkblades at even domestic locations. They are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">tenaciously </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">trying to gather the shards for their nefarious purpose.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzdiZDQyZmRjODQzODk4ZGQ0MzIxMTQzNmM2OGIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Which is?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmEwNTQ1YzU5YzRkOGZhZjYxYWIwNDY3ZGZiZDU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weapon construction. Of what form we don’t know, but it will unquestionably be a great danger to Cascadia and all life.” Chesterfield rubbed the bridge of his nose. “We’re on the precipice of a great war at an industrial scale never before seen in this realm. Yet, even that may pale compared to what might happen if the Enemy gains possession of too many shards.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjYyZTYxN2E4YzQ1Njk5MWI3NmM2YTI4YTZhMjU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The insidious plans of the darkblades are centuries in the making, and our own plans to counter them are equally long. This task is a priority for the Empress…” Chesterfield leaned forward, his expression becoming serious again. “Are you two prepared to play your part? With faith and obedience to her Divine Will? Are you prepared to demonstrate your loyalty to her, who seeks to protect not only demonkind but also humankind forever?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGE5MjMwYzUxZjRmMTViMzZkYzQ5MjE1NDE0Mjhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena gulped. Despite her ability to remain calm in most situations, the magnitude and significance of this task made her shake in anticipation. To follow orders given directly by </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDE3NjEzYmFlMzQ3NTU5ZjRhMzgyNTBkZDBjYjk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will serve with loyalty and honour,” Serena replied, determination dripping from her voice. This was a grand purpose; perhaps it would be her life’s purpose. She would welcome it!</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjkyZWIwOWJiZDQ4MGJiZTg0MWJhOGY0MGNjY2Zi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesterfield nodded, satisfied with her response. He turned to Amelia with the same question. Amelia was a little taken aback by the sudden seriousness of the moment but kept her calm.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDE1ZjgwOWZlNDQzMGRiMmIxZjU4ZDY4MTllYzA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah! I will serve with loyalty and… honour!” Amelia nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzJhYjg4OTNiZjRjNjhiMzZjN2YzNzZjZWRmNDJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent. We leave immediately. A carriage outside will take us to the airdocks, where I’ll provide further details. Any questions?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGE3OGUzYzE5MzQ0NTZhYzM3YzljMmY3MTNlZTRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Serena answered immediately.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDg2YzJlNGQyNzQxNGRhODNlM2EzOGE4NmNkODE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait! I can’t go!” Amelia blurted out suddenly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGIxMTk3MTg3NDRlYTM5ODJjMjc1M2E5N2U1OTIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” Serena and Chesterfield uttered simultaneously.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzA5YzY0MzQyNzQwZTFiZTE4ZjBlOGRkNmM3OTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…” Amelia hesitated for a moment. “I promised Lani I would help her with her workbooks this afternoon! Plus, she told me she would teach me the etiquette differences between Manwese and Samino culture! So I can only leave tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTIwMDViMGJkOTQ3NjA4YjNlZTNlOTU3ZjA5OTkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You…” Chesterfield began and then stopped himself. He spent a moment collecting himself before asking in disbelief, “Are you really - in light of everything we’ve discussed - going to prioritise </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">homework</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> over </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">divinely given</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> duty?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTM4ZDA3MmZhYjRmMjA4MGU1ODcyMzQ0Y2NiOTJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!” Amelia declared, crossing her arms. “I’m prioritising a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">promise</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> made by </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">House Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to a lady of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">House Halen!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">refuse</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to let the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sacred pinky promise</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> be broken! If it’s such a problem, then I can leave in the night and fly to catch up with the ship!” Amelia shrugged. “I know ways to get wings without Speaking my Second Word, and I’ve had a lot of practice!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2I0NDMwZTIzNzRhYjI4YTNjMzk5OWQyZGM5ODI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesterfield’s eyes twitched and Serena found herself only amused by the reaction. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">See what I have to deal with,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she thought. A small part of her wanted to chastise Amelia, but Chesterfield was slimy, and Serena knew he was keeping a lot of information from her. Allowing Amelia to, well, be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was her way of getting back at him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzEyNzNmOTFhMzQ2ZjI4N2VhZTQyYzNhYjllNTI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fine</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Chesterfield finally intoned. “I suppose this behaviour is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">understandable</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, given your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">personality</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” It looked like it took him great effort, but Chesterfield eventually recovered his regular, easy-going expression. “We can leave tomorrow. I’ll send a carriage for you at first light.” He stood up, and Serena and Amelia quickly joined him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWI3ZTY2ZGU3MzQ0MzFiNGYzOGRiNzg2NThmZDUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Halen, Lord-Prospect Thornheart. On behalf of the Empire and her Divine Ruler, I sincerely thank you for accepting this duty.” He bowed deeply to them with such perfect movement Serena immediately pegged him as someone from a highborn family. “Now, I have important matters to discuss with Highlord Halen. Thank you both for your time.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODE4NDQ0OTNkOTQ0MzJhNDU1N2I5MWQ4ZjgzODc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… goodbye, Captain, Miss Thornheart…” Anathor grumbled, and the skull's glowing eyes dimmed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDdkNmM2ZjkxMzRhMGU4Yzk3YWFjMWNlYzA0MWEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena bowed back, and Amelia quickly followed. With no more words, Chesterfield packed up the skull and boxes and left the study. They didn’t move until his footsteps had long disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzFkMDIxNGU1ZDQzNjU4NWQwZjQ2MGUyNDlkN2M0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia looked at Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTI2OTYwZWY0ZTQ4NGU4MTBkMzMxODFlYmQ5YWIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s an arsehole, isn’t he?” Amelia said with a cheeky smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODIzNzAzMGY3YTQwNTc4YTdjNWIzYzQ1Yzk4MWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena laughed, ruffling Amelia’s hair and, ignoring her protests, pulled her into an embrace. “Idiot,” she said. “He’s dangerous.” Before Amelia could respond, Serena put a hand around the back of Amelia's head and kissed her. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjllMzMxZTg1MDQzZmE4MjdiZTE2OGJmM2Q2NTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When Amelia leaned back, Serena found herself captivated by the blond human.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDA1OWUyM2EwMDRmNTZhOWNlMDM4MTUzZWNjMWI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So am I,” Amelia said with a wink.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTBkNDc1YzdmNzQ2MjZiOGY3ZWZkZmUyOWIyMzA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">How can a human be this beautiful? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s even more attractive with demon eyes.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Feeling a sudden urge, she pulled Amelia back in and set about enjoying the softness of her lips.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWIyM2VjNzJhZjQ0ZjI4OWUyZmM4MTViMzZlNmVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTUwODEyOTNmNzRhNmFhNjJkZDA3NjdkZjM1NWMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmQ1ZWJmMzJlMDQzYWJiMDdkMTdkYTQzMzE2YTgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDQwNTllNmViMzRmZTFiOWUzMWYxOTY1YWRiMDlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmph!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjA3NWRjYzVkZjQxMjdiMDgxNDY5NjlmNDM0MmJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia pulled away, her face flushed. “I need some air!” She grinned as she frantically wafted her face. “What’s got into you so suddenly? You were so serious a moment ago!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWMzODEwOGMzMzQ3MTRiYjlkYzM4YzJmYzJiM2Mz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena smiled, feeling her cheeks become warm. “I made a promise, remember?” Serena ran a hand through Amelia’s hair, tucking it behind her ear. “You made me promise always to hug and kiss you when I felt like it. And now… I feel like it.” She pulled Amelia in and again gave her a long kiss. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzBlNmFhN2IxNDQwZTU5YTI1MWU1MDMyNjdlNjcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, Serena hadn’t expected it to be so intense. Then again, it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> been several days since they had last had a moment of proper intimacy. Damn it! Their time in Kenhoro had conditioned her to get used to an unreasonable amount of attention and pleasure. How were they going to manage on the ship? Would Anathor complain?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmVjNWM1MTNjNTQzNjA4ZjA1YTU0MjE1OTZkZTkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe…” Amelia nuzzled against Serena’s neck before giving her a gentle kiss.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzBjZjdmOWIwNDRjNjBiODA5YzVhOGY3YjQ2Y2Rj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you, Ren,” Amelia whispered. The words made Serena’s heart soar, and she decided she would never take such words for granted or get sick of hearing them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzEwMmFkNzE1ZjQ1YmQ4YjlkYzYxMDUxYjZmZDI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you, Lia,” she whispered back. Serena placed a hand under Amelia's chin and slightly tilted her head up. Then, taking a moment to look into those beautiful crimson eyes, leaned in.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWUyYzk5YTg0YzRiOGI5Y2RjMDg4ZDc2Y2JmODdi" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Until, again, their lips met.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMzM2IzZDI3YTYwZDQ1OTQ5MjcyMTcwNmZlYzJiZjFl"><img alt="New Scene - Lani POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/lani.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNhNzYzNzZjNzk2NTQwYTZhZmRjMGJmM2YxMzIzYmM1">Lani was bored. Father had instructed her to stay out of the way while he had important guests, but that was <em>hours</em> ago. What was she supposed to do? Sit in her room and poke holes in her pillow with her horns? Annoyingly, that was precisely what she had been doing! After thoroughly destroying one pillow, Lani sat up in bed and proceeded to tilt her head back, leaving two small dents in the wooden frame behind her.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTNjYmRiZGM3MDRlYjc5NzNkYmI4YmQyYWZlOGQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… Am… Bored…” Lani muttered, punctuating each word by nodding backwards and further damaging the wooden bedframe. On the bright side, her horns had grown enough to do this! A year ago, she’d had to bend her neck all the way back!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmY2MDhjNjgwYzQ1Mzc5ZGJiOTYwNzNmN2UxNzZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lani, my dear,” said the old maid sitting across the room. “How much of the house are you intending to destroy with your horns?” The old maid spoke in that <em>you're-being-childish</em></span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>-</em>and-we-both-know-it</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> tone that annoyed Lani so much.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWIzMGJmYjc4NDQ3OGRiMTY2NTQ5YThmMjgxNTJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of it!” Lani declared, bashing her horns against the wood once again. “Maybe then Father wouldn’t lock me up with nothing to do!” It was so frustrating! Lani wanted to socialise with her human friend but apparently Amelia had to attend a bunch of meetings! Couldn’t they do it another time!?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzcxMTM1NzMzNDQ2ODQ5MzYyYzlkM2Q4ODQxY2Rl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re not locked up, dear,” said the maid, raising a finger. “Why not walk around the gardens?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTNkNzdiOGI4MjQ3Mjg5NTA0YTEyZDM0NGQ4NDMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t want to.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmVhMjM1ZTE5YjQ3NTY5NTkxOGQ1NmM5YmFmZmMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shall we have some tea in the conservatory?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDg3MzMwNzkxOTQ2M2Y5ZTM5NTUxYjhkMjM0MjZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boring.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTRjNGY5MDUwZjRjODFiNTMwYWY1N2JmYTQ3YTc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We could bake those cookies again? You know, the ones with the popping sugar?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTA3NTc5NjdkNzRiNTdhOTA1ZGI3YTk0MWMyNzZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Uhhh…</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Lani rolled her eyes and then rolled her body off the bed, letting herself fall into a crumbled heap.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTExYWZiZmY1NTQyY2NhNjdiYmI0YmI5YzIyZTZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, the lady of the house seems to have died!” Lani heard the maid intone cheerfully. “To think, after surviving such struggles! What a shame… just as Highlord Corvus and his guest are leaving! Speaker Thornheart is going to be so-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzU2YzMzYjdkMDQ3ZmNiNzk3ODEyMDk2ZDc2NDJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!?” Lani leapt up and ran to the window. There, she saw Highlord Corvus with his scary-looking horns shaking hands with Father. A carriage was waiting for them and inside Lani could see the plain-looking demon that had come with the Highlord. “Why didn’t you tell me sooner, old woman!” Lani complained. “I’m free!” Lani darted to the door and threw it open, bouncing down the hallway and leaving the old maid behind.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjgwY2JiYTlkOTQ5NmI5OWJmZjgzODU4YmQ3MDA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe!” Lani giggled to herself but quickly stopped when she remembered her job to teach Amelia what it meant to be a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">proper</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> lady! She forced herself to slow down, corrected her posture and kept her head high. “Mmm… now where are you…” Amelia told her she would find Lani after her meetings, but Lani couldn’t wait that long!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNThlODAzZmFhMjQyOTI4YjdlOGM4YTE0NmJhZjBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After not finding Amelia in the entryway or the kitchens, a servant informed her that Amelia was probably still in Father’s study along with Serena. After chastising the servant for not telling her sooner, Lani walked as fast as her dignified posture would allow and soon found herself outside the room in question. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGZmYWQ5Zjc4MTQ3YTliM2UzMmIzMzY4MWEzZWIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena might tell her off for walking in, but Serena had already had more than enough of Amelia’s time! It was her turn now! </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDc5MzQ2NWRlNzQzZGZhNjQ4OGE4NjJiMmZiNmQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lani threw open the study door. “Hello! Amelia- huh?” Lani’s words were cut short as she saw Amelia being </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thrown</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> away from Serena; the human fell to the floor and tumbled before stopping.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTUxMzg0YWQzZDRhODhhNmU0ZWQ5YjNlYTE2Y2I0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia was red-faced and breathing heavily. Her hair was ruffled and to make things even worse, her shirt was ripped and some of the buttons had come undone! “What-” Lani looked at Amelia, then at Serena to find her sister was also red-faced and looking at Lani in surprise!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzZkM2ViMDljMDRmMGNhYmJkZDRhMTM2YTI4YTRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lani, I didn’t hear you…” Serena muttered. She seemed angry, but strangely, when she met Lani's gaze, she turned her head away with a guilty expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjE5MDQwNmZjOTQ1MzQ5NDg1YTk3YzM1MDNlMWU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What in the Seven Hells was going on!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTIyMjk1MjNhODRhMTdhOWFkZWMzNzVhNmU1ZGE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hang on a minute…” Lani muttered, crossing her arms and narrowing her eyes. She observed the two women and mentally recounted the facts. Her guilty-looking sister. Amelia being pushed to the ground. Amelia, with ripped clothing and also an expression of guilt and shame…</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmEzNTI0NmEyMjQyZTVhYTVjNWRhYjEzYTRjMGRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It could only mean one thing!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjJmYmI5Y2JhNDQwMTViYzcxMjI5MjVhYzc4Y2E1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you!” Lani pointed an accusatory finger at Serena, stepping between the demon and the human. “You’re bullying Amelia, aren’t you!? You’re beating her up! How… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">How horrible!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” She felt tears form as her anger rose. How could Serena do something so cruel? “Amelia’s not part of your crew!” Lani declared, trying to sound as forceful as possible. “You’re not allowed to hurt her! I’m going to tell Father!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGRjZTU4NTNmNDRkYWU4YTIwMzliZDAyMGNiMjMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!” Both her sister and Amelia cried out suddenly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjJkYTEzZTUwZTRhYjY4ZGYwNDczZGNjOWI3MmZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lani, look…” Serena mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDQxYmVmMjU2NDRiYTA4OWE4YjdlNTA5MWI0ZTUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lani! I’m fine!” Amelia popped up with a smile, patting her hair and adjusting her shirt. “Your sister wasn’t punishing me! I promise! She was just, uh, showing me some of her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimokan </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">martial techniques! She’s been teaching me!” Amelia said, nodding enthusiastically.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTdkZDk0NGM2YzRhNjE4NzFhOWY5ZTU4ZWM3MGEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Too suspicious!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGZmNGE5MDRkZDRmNGNiMzMzMzY1MzUzNTFkODI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’ve heard about this! The victim makes excuses for the perpetrator! Is that what’s happening!?” Lani glared at the pair! She would get to the bottom of why Serena was bullying her friend!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDk2NGVmMmY2NTQyYzFhZWY1MTRlNGFmYzI3YjUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Christ in the Seven Hells…” Serena muttered, making the sign of the demon cross. “I’m going to go insane…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTFmZmRlNmZkZTQzMjRiNDc1OTBkMmRjZWQ2OGVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lani!” Amelia exclaimed. “I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">promise</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that everything’s fine. We train like this all the time! Serena says it’s important to practice martial arts in all kinds of places, to get used to fighting at unexpected times!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2JjYjEwYzU3NTRiZjQ4ZjY0YzBhOTUxN2JkNmM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lani wanted to roll her eyes, but the sincerity in Amelia’s gaze made her pause. Maybe it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> just a bit of martial arts training. Amelia </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">told her she was being taught before…</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjMxNDI1ODk5YTRiNTQ4YzQzYzkyODAyNWZjYzBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you promise?” Lani asked suspiciously. “Do you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">pinky-promise</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzc2MTQ3MjYzMTRhYmE5ZjIwNWE2MzFjMTQwZjRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">pinky-promise</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that I’m not getting bullied!” Amelia held out her pinky. “You just walked in at a… uh… inopportune time.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTIwYTM1ZmUwMTRjOTM4ZTY0NzE4MTRiMjEzMzBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lani grasped the outstretched pinky with her own. “Fine! But we’re going to spend the rest of the day together, right!?” Amelia nodded and reaffirmed the promise. “Hrmph!” Lani declared triumphantly. She stuck her tongue out at her big sister and led Amelia out of the office. First, she would find Amelia a new shirt and then tell Amelia all the recent gossip Lani remembered from the Academy!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDEyNDA2NjZjOTQ0OGM4YmVhM2ZlOTJhMWVjMTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As she left and walked down the hallway, she heard a sound from the study that suspiciously sounded like two horns ramming into a wall.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGE2YWE3MDc0NzRkNmQ4YzcxOGUyMTVlOTlhODkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMDE1YmUzMDJhNzRmNzdhMzAyZTI5M2YxNWYxNjJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNlYTZhMjBiZjExOTQyMzJiZGJjMDQ0ODYxZjVmYTRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Night had fallen, Lani had gone to bed, and Serena had finally found time to relax with Amelia. The pair of them sat on the balcony outside Serena’s room and watched the blue moonlight gently bathe the great distant forest. Shimashina was built on a shallower plateau than most other cities; it sat a mere hundred feet above the ground. Serena took some time to point out the remains of the old walls built at the plateau’s edge.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTgzOTc4ZGM4YTQ4MzViZjlhNDE0M2U4ZWFjYmQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The beasts must have been truly fearsome,” Amelia said thoughtfully after Serena explained the defensive structure. “For demons to build another wall despite being so safe up here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDIxMzEwOGY2ZjRlMTc5MGY0NTQ2ODM5YTkzNzI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some could climb the rock, and some could fly,” Serena explained, remembering the words of The Bible. “So every bit helps. Still, the rock protected us from the types that could burrow through the earth. It must have been a terrifying time…” Serena trailed off. What would it have been like to live in those times? Pockets of resistance desperately surviving on rocky formations, not knowing if they were the last demons left? Not knowing anything until the Empress and her armies came to save them?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTEzODQzMGM0YzQ0MWY5ZjQ3YzdmM2Y3Yzc4MThj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh… almost as scary as Lani walking in on us early,” Amelia said, flashing a sly smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzlhMTViZTJkMTQxZDk4MmUxOTI0MzM1YTAwNjg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seven Hells, that girl…” Serena muttered. “I can’t believe she snuck up on </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">us</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!” Like Amelia, Serena had exceptional hearing, yet they had been so occupied with their </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">activities</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that Lani had approached unheard! “I suppose it’s a lesson… How was your day with her?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTdlNzIzNTAwNjRjZWFiZWZjNmU1MmFlMzEwYTYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s smarter than she lets on,” Amelia said. “I think she lacks experience working hard for something. All the spoiling has led her to think everything should be easy, and if it isn’t, then it’s not worth it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGZlYzdmZGZiNDQ0MzU5ZjQ3ZmFkM2RmZmNjMTMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena clicked her tongue. “Try telling Father that. Maybe he’ll listen to you.” Amelia laughed, and they relaxed further into their chairs. Amelia propped her legs up on the railing. It was a terrible breach of etiquette, but Serena let it go. After all, who would see them at this time?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTAxYjA0MmJlNTQ0MjFiMDUwNGIxNzg3OTRmYjc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The moon’s getting bigger.” Amelia pointed at the sky. The blue moon had passed its apoapsis and was on its way back down. In a few weeks, it would begin decelerating, and thousands of tonnes of its moon crystals would detach and rain down across the East.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDc2MThiZjVkMTRkY2RhYTAyODMyN2M1MDY1MDQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought we might be in Shimashina longer to witness the moonrain here, but it looks like we’ll catch it back home instead,” Serena explained quietly. She had assumed the repairs would take longer in Kenhoro. With the extra assistance they’d received, not only did they finish early, but they had also installed the new propeller that was supposed to reduce cavitation. She would have to test it out on the way.</span></p><span class="cjkzZTdlM2Q0NGNhMTQzNDk4NWM1ZDhkNjgxZDEwYzg4"><br/>Unauthorized usage: this narrative is on Amazon without the author's consent.

<p class="cnMyYWJjNGIyY2IwNjQ3N2E4OGQxOTQyMDAwN2E5Mjk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shame we’re leaving so soon,” Amelia said, yawning loudly. “I like it here. It’s quiet, and everyone’s so nice. Your father… Lani… even the house employees! I thought they would make snide comments behind my back, but they were so… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">professional</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDRjZWNhYjcyNzRkZTU5MDY3ZjJhOTI5ZjEzZmNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course they were,” Serena answered. “Being employed in a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> house is a prestigious position. They aren’t just some shop worker.” Any employee that would mutter insults or gossip behind their employer's back would never make it past the interview stage anyway. “They understand that insulting you - a guest - would insult Father. They would also be well aware of the heightened hearing present in Speaker households.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGMwNzM5ZWJhODRiM2JiMWQ2M2ExOTk2Yzk1MWU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makes sense,” Amelia mused.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmJmYjg4ZWU5MDQ3MDNhYmRkOWQyMzc1ODc1MDg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The pair of them talked about small topics before Serena decided it was time to move on to the lingering topic they had mutually been avoiding for a while. Still, Serena didn’t want to ask directly, so she settled on asking around it first.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzEzZWU3ZjI0MzQyNmI4MjZlZjg5ZDA0N2JjMTc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What was it like, Speaking the Second Word?” Serena asked tentatively.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2Q0OTdhNzgxNDQ0OThhMjEzMDYxMzlhNjIyNzRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…” Amelia placed a finger on her cheek, looking up in thought. “It was strange. When you Speak the First Word you’re just supplied with their divine aether, right? When I Spoke the Second Word it was like </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> came in person and shared my body, my </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">new</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> body, that is. We could speak to each other just by thinking.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTc2ZDMyOGRkNjQ4ZDQ5ZTNiNzc5ODYxODMwMjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> like?” Serena couldn’t help but feel a little excited. Information regarding the Second Word and how it worked was not easy to come by. She would warn Amelia not to be too forthcoming, but for now, she would take advantage of her girlfriend’s honesty.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzViNzM3MDAzOTRlYmE4YzVkOTI2YzRlMDVjMDk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh, he didn’t like me much. He complained about me </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">forcing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the connection, which I suppose I did. Oh,” Amelia raised a finger. “When I first Spoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the initial communication with him was like an attack. I think you’d need to be able to speak </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">at least three</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> First Words to handle a Second Word.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjNkOTY5NGU1NTRhODlhZjNmMjE1M2E4YTY1ZDQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena found herself nodding. Three First Words matched what she had heard elsewhere. And Three First Words were only the start of Amelia's talents. Speaking of...</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGFkMmE5NDdiYTRhY2ViYjU1N2U5MTg0MTBmNGUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey…” Serena said softly. “When you were transformed, did you ever try… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you know</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…” she gestured awkwardly, then sighed, seeing Amelia not understand what she was implying. “Did you ever try and form the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Third Word?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Serena finished as quietly as she could. After Amelia had confessed her true powers to Serena, this was one of several topics they tended to avoid. She usually wouldn’t dare bring it up vocally, but Amelia had growing confidence in using sound-blocking spells from the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaxai</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> branch. Even with the spellwork active, Serena made sure to whisper.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzRlMjdiODIzYzRlOTBhZDMwM2ExOWI4MDU2Y2Ew" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, oh!” Amelia’s eyes widened. “No, I didn’t,” she said in a hushed voice. “I’m kind of scared to do so without more information, you know? You saw how I lost myself with the Second Word. I can’t imagine how much deeper the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bond</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> will become. That much power… it’s quite scary, you know? I feel much more in control now, but still…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDJhMzVlMTc4MTQ1OTRhMzIwMDZjNTg4OWM2ZTQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena questioned Amelia further about her transformation experience and soon felt ready to pierce the main topic. “So, about Polina…” she began. “It’s difficult for me to understand.” Amelia had passionately defended Polina yet quickly ended her efforts when Chesterfield demanded it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGQ2MTQwZTMwZTQ1ODU4NzY1OTU5MWM3N2Q4NWRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia took a moment to answer. “When I was transformed, I could </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">see</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her soul. I could see your soul, too. That level of perception is difficult to explain, but you can truly see someone’s nature. There was no wickedness and evil, so the thought of killing her for her idiotic actions seemed fundamentally </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wrong</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to me. If treated correctly, I believe she can escape her dislike of demonkind. That's what I wanted to do, and by doing it, I would prove there can be unity between demons and humans... Looking back, I think I was a bit selfish...”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWYzMjI3NGE0ZDRmNzhhYmZmMmJmMzQyNzUzYTVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena nodded; given her girlfriend's overly friendly and optimistic personality, she could just about understand where Amelia was coming from. "I think I understand," Serena said, taking a breath and pausing. It was time to let Amelia know what Polina had hinted at during her interrogation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWE5MTFiZjRiYzRjZDU5NjFhZDgwMzA4N2I3MmYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Back in forty-two, just after I became captain of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena began. “We were tasked with hunting down Republican trade ships. We knew they were using the trade routes along the North Sabanis Channel to import Federation weapons and aimed to hit them the moment they entered Republican airspace where we could legally attack them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTQ4NWZhOGQzYzRkZDJiNjAxNmE2MTAyMzlmZGVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We had intel on a convoy. Eight medium transports. I had the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> waiting within the lumina, and soon, our Observer's eyes picked them up. Everything matched the intel. The number and type of ships, the location. I gave the order, and we unleashed hell.” Serena sighed, unable to keep the guilt from creeping into her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTFiMGY5Mjg0NjRiYzA5ODkyNjM1MDljNDgyYTFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“After the smoke had settled, we realised we had just shredded eight civilian ships. Federation ships. I don’t know if the Republicans pulled off a bait and switch to try to bring the Federation into the war, or the Federation intentionally set up a false flag to legitimise sending aid, or if it was a genuine mistake or bad intel.” She cleared her throat. “But almost three hundred civilians died. Some ships managed to make it to landfall, but most fell into the undersky.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTQzMjYwN2JjODRjZTVhYzgwZDFhNTI1YTBjY2E4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s why so many humans hate me. They view me as responsible for a slaughter, and in some way, I am.” Serena turned to look at Amelia. Thankfully, her girlfriend seemed just to be listening and showed no signs of disgust. “It was ultimately ruled an accident, but it’s blood on my hands that’ll never wash off and ensures I’ll have people after my horns for as long as I live. Polina must have had friends or family on that convoy. That type of hatred, the type she has… it’s not the type that goes away easily.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODc3ZmMwMWVmODQzMTQ5ODI1NmE4NTdjNDI2MmJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah,” Amelia said. “I understand your hesitation now.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDYzMzZkODNmOTRiOTVhOGIwNjA0NjJkOGYzMmFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And… what do you think? About me? Now that you know?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDZlODA4NTk2ZjQ2YzZiZTU4NzUzZWNhYTJkMjQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> an accident, wasn’t it?” Amelia looked thoughtful. “I understand these things happen in war. We’ve had our fair share of World Wars. I think there were…” Amelia began counting on her fingers. “Seven? Or eight?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjM3Njc5Mzg3MDQ3NzlhZDk0YjA3NWNiZGIwZDE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s a World War?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTVhYmM0OTkxYTQzMjQ4NzBkNWRhNjhmNTM3ODgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a war involving every nation in the world. Pretty devastating stuff,” Amelia explained. Serena tried to imagine a conflict of that scale but couldn’t. Would the Long Discordancy count as a World War? “Anyway,” Amelia continued, “It's not all that different from Polina's situation, is it? You both did something by accident, and others blame you for it. Anyway, it doesn’t change how I feel, and I’m here if you ever want to talk about it, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODc3MWMxZmQ4ODRjMTBhYmY3NTUwODM2NWYxZWMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena smiled. Whatever had she done to deserve such a caring and loyal girlfriend?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzJjM2RkOWFlNzRjOWY5MDRkMGNjN2QzZWFjNTdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Amelia. I guess I've been viewing the situation as a soldier while you've been viewing it as, well, <em>you</em>. Still, there's one more thing I don't understand. After such efforts to protect Polina, why did you obey Chesterfield’s request?” It surprised Serena that Amelia, who almost challenged an Overlord directly over Polina, would relent to some high-up Intelligence Officer from Centralis.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYThjOTZhOTgxNDRjOGQ5OWFiNjU3ZjVhYjU1OTYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Well…” Amelia shivered slightly. “Firstly, Chesterfield was difficult for me to read. It was as if something was blocking my intuition. What did he feel like to you? A mage, or a warrior?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjQyZWRhZmQ0MTRmZDNiMzI2MjE1Y2VkOThiZDg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Neither,” Serena answered, thinking back to the plain-looking demon from which she sensed no talent with aether.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGE2ZWFlNjk0MjQ5MDZiODU5MTk5YTA4OTkwMjNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly, yet there was this subtle intensity when he asked me to stop my ward. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0">I’m not sure, but at that moment, I could sense <em>danger</em> from him.</span> There’s more to him than meets the eye. I stopped it because I felt it would be a mistake to resist, and I decided to trust you when you told me Polina wouldn’t be harmed. I suppose I always trusted you… I was just being a bit stubborn regarding the whole situation. Besides…” Amelia smiled softly. “I didn’t want to cause any harm to the arcwhales.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGY4YWZhYjczZDQzMjY5YWU2YmNlNDJiM2RkYmE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!” Serena laughed. “Idiot.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGNjZjVhNGUxNDRkNmY4NjM5NjM1OTNiMzRlNzI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… did you notice?” Amelia sat up with an inquisitive look in her eyes. “Chesterfield didn’t feel like a mage or a warrior, yet he knew when I had stopped the ward. It’s suspicious. I wanted to look closer but didn’t want to Speak to increase my perception. Maybe next time we meet, I’ll be in a position I can look closer!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzM0ZTJlYjg0NjQzNTY4YTA0Nzg1M2RhZjVlNzJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We should be careful… I hope we never see him again,” Serena muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTk5ZDljZjkzYzQzYjQ5YWZiMTVmOWQzY2FiNjEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…” Amelia mumbled after a moment of silence. “There’s something I wanted to say.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2JlZjI1MDhiMjQ5NzFiOTgwM2Q4YjkwMjM3NzJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDgzNDEyNTYyNTRjNzE5MzViMjU3Yjg0NTI1NjVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a little awkward, but I sometimes forget how much of a big deal it is for you to… You know…” Amelia gestured wildly, “...fight for Cascadia. Be a Cascadian Lord and be part of this thing that is bigger than just you. I don’t really have the same level of attachment to the whole Empire thing, and I’m not sure I ever will, so…” Amelia took a breath. “I just wanted to promise you I’ll never make you choose between your duty and me, okay? We can exist side-by-side! Ah…” Amelia buried her face in her hands.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzVmMmZlYTQzNzQzZDRiYjAwZTc2NzFlMGY0MWFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s… thoughtful of you,” Serena answered with a smile, enjoying Amelia’s shyness.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGM3YWQ5MjIyZjQ4MWY4Mzk3NjRkMzdlYWJhNTlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And, and…” Amelia muttered. “I also promise that for me, I’m </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">always</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> going to put you first because…” She looked down and poked her index fingers together. “I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">really </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">like you,” Amelia said in a small voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODJkZDRhMjFhMzQ2MDc5ZTlmNjEyZDI2ZTY2MzFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot,” Serena ruffled her girlfriend's hair as her cheeks warmed. Amelia was so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">cute</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> sometimes. She had already confessed her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">love</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to Serena, yet she was getting all awkward about this! “Look after yourself as well. I would say try not to get into trouble in the future, but that’s a given with you, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjUyMDNkYmVhMjQ4MDdiMjhlNzRkNmYyMDQxYTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey!” Amelia puffed out her cheeks and Serena couldn’t resist pulling on them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDYxYzExZGE5NDRhZTQ5NWYwNDAwMmM4ZmY5Zjlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you excited about teaching magic?” Serena asked once she had her fill of Amelia’s soft cheeks. “I imagine they’ll want you to use your monstrous aether reserves to demonstrate magic for the class. You’ll be in front of several dozen mages. Will you be okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWY1NTFlNTIwMDQ3ZjA4N2U3OWJmNzFiZjc0MGI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah!” Amelia nodded. “I’ll just imagine I’m you! Strutting about with your head held high and looking down on everyone- mmph!” Amelia’s answer was cut off as Serena once again explored how much Amelia’s cheeks would stretch.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDYxYTA2NmJiMjQ2OGViNzMyMTFhNzU0MzMzMGM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s a new type of training I want to introduce you to,” Serena explained. “We’ll do it when we sail to Asamaywa. It’s something all talented soldiers go through, and while you’re not a soldier, you need to get used to the sounds of battle.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWJiMjBkOWM2ZTQ2MTFiOTNjZTkwNGMzNjM1NGFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Sounds of battle?” Amelia mumbled through stretched cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTRlZjRiZGQ2MzQ5Y2ViNzU3NDhhYjlmOThiMWYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Warfare is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">loud</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Most civilians don’t understand how loud it is. Even if shellfire cannot harm you, you still need to get used to it and learn how to override your instincts to hide. This training will help you with that.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmRlNGVhNTFhZjQwYWJhNzhlMGE0MTc2MGZjOGE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I see</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Can you stop playing with my cheeks?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDBmYmRmNTVkZjQ2NGI4ZmVmODRlZGVlZDhhZWU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena pulled her arms back, but Amelia reached forward and grabbed her hands. Her girlfriend looked at her with a twinkle in her eye. “We’re leaving tomorrow, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDM5ZjYyMjk0ZDRhOThiNzA2MTZmM2EwMTY3OWM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWZhYzU4OGI5YjQzNjM4YTg3OTdjMmE4Y2JlNTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then tonight might be the last night for a while that we can…” Amelia tilted her head towards the bedroom. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">You know…</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWVjNDZkN2JlZjRmMTBhZjI5ZWQxZTQxZTVjYTA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena rolled her eyes but couldn’t help smiling. “You’re so shameless sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzU4Y2UzMGEzMzQzMzdhZWQ4ZTBhYWQ0MDAwMjI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you have a coin?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODg2MjkxZGJmNTQ4NjA4ZmZkZGFmNTc0OWMzNDBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTcxY2I5MjFkNTQ4OTdiMmZkNzQ5ZDQ5YjZjODYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia repeated the sudden request and Serena dug out a half-denarii. “Here,” she said, passing it to Amelia who flicked it in the air. She caught it and covered it in her palm.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Mzg1ZDlhODRjYTRkYTZiZTgzODA0MzQxY2QwNjQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heads or tails?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjZhOTcwMjE1ZDQyZTc4YTA1M2Y0NTQ4NjEyOTBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For what?” Serena narrowed her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGRjMzBmNTQ5ZjRkMmJhMmRkNzA4ZThlODI5NGRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just answer!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDg3NzExNGNiZjQzMDZiMjY4NWUzYTY2OGVhYjg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“.. Heads. What’s this for?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDRjMTE3NDU5MDQ0ZGU5NGUyOTUxOTIyNThkY2I5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia looked up with a cheeky grin. “It’s for whoever’s tongue goes first, obviously!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzBhOTFiZTY3NjQ3OTY4NTRiNzBiMzY3YmUyY2U4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s eyes widened, but before she could chastise Amelia for being so crass, her girlfriend opened her palm and revealed the coin. The answer sent them both giggling into the bedroom, where their last night in Shimashina was bereft of sleep and instead full of many soft moans.</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Forty-Two: The Cascadian Ambassador</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM3ZDM0NTczMjE1NDRhZDRhZGI2ODQ5ZDc4YWM3ZDQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="Interlude - Anton POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/interludeanton.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTM3OGZkYmI1NDRmZGJhNWJjNWI2ODU0YzhhMjJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton peered through the windows, watching the arriving ship come into dock above the Numengrad skyline. The capital of the Federation was usually cool this time of year, however, the warm air from the southern storms had finally reached the city, causing an abnormal amount of humidity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton opened the window the few inches it allowed. Windows in the Red Citadel - the center of government for the Federation - couldn’t be opened fully. Still, the subtle breeze freshened the room and took away some of the stickiness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDQ3MDU4YzVmMTRlOWJiYjc2YWNkYzU2Y2VhZTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ship docked in the Red Citadel's private airdock where a small group disembarked. Even from this distance, the singular demon in the group was easily identified. Standing a head above the rest, the height difference was further emphasised by two sets of horns. The demon glanced at the Red Citadel with an indecipherable expression before following a guard out of sight.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTQ2OWE4NzQ4YjQzZjBiZDZlNmNkNWQ3YTYyZmNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Calvin Cornelissen, the Cascadian Ambassador to the Federation, had arrived.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWRhNjVmMmU1MDRlY2Y5NGQwMmIwNjI4MGMyYzEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sighing, Anton walked away from the window and brewed some Jimari coffee. He always made sure to brew Cascadian coffee when meeting with their ambassador; it was important to show that despite the sanctions Cascadia had leveraged against the Federation for its just support of Republican efforts, they were easily circumvented.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGJhZGYxZGRhNjRiZTFiYjQ1MjQyZmJlNDgzZWIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton sat down and nursed his coffee. Under his instruction, the guards would make Ambassador Cornelissen wait ten minutes. The Federation was always busy serving the people; therefore, you wait for the Federation, and the Federation does not wait for you. Even so, for this particular matter, Anton’s mind was too busy by recent events to make good use of the enforced waiting time. His mind churned over the difficult conversation that was about to happen.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTk4ZGE2MWE5OTRiOWY4ZDRkZjUxMWJjYjA1YWVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t help that when this conversation was over he would report to the head of the Red Navy and the head of the People’s Army. Two individuals who could crush any man or demon with their presence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTM4N2MxYTE5MDQ4ZGZiNjY0NjVjZjUxM2E1ZmE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The allotted time passed in silence and then a side door opened. A guard stepped through. A rifle was holstered over his shoulder and his uniform was simple and brown. Yet, foolish would the man be who assumed this man was a simple soldier; a guard position in the Red Citadel was an elite position reserved for only the most loyal and decorated soldiers. This simple guard would, at minimum, be an orange-aura warrior and likely had decades of experience using it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTBkOTlmNTUzYzQ0MTdiZTBhYjYzODdjMTM2MzVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Ambassador is waiting for you, sir,” informed the guard.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTk1ZjNlOWViYzQ2MjViNjQ1NTY0OWRhM2U2MGQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton stood up, tidied his uniform and let the guard lead him to the meeting room. The room itself was large and immaculate with white marble floors and a long polished ironwood table. This table was almost ten meters long and if Anton really wanted to indicate his disapproval, he would make sure his guest would sit at one end and Anton at the other.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGUxZTI0YjhhYjQ5YmFhZGFhMTExNzgwMDdlOWI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, now was not the time for that kind of politicking and so Calvin Cornelissen was sitting in the center of the long table. The ambassador stood up when Anton entered the room but Anton waved him down. Anton passed his usual position at the head of the table and sat down opposite the ambassador.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzY5NGI2Y2JmYjQyNjE4MDY3M2Q5MDk1YjA3M2E0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a small sense of satisfaction Anton noted the guard had sat Cornelissen down on the right side of the table. Now, when the ambassador faced him as he did now, his vision would be consumed by the enormous ten-by-sixteen foot painting behind Anton upon which the visage of the leader of the Federation would bore his painted eyes into the demon.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGMyODAxZGRiOTQwZDc5NzliYTdjZTFhMTI4YzQz" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ambassador,” Anton cooly intoned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Zjg0MzIzOTVhMjQ5MzE5ZGM5MzJlMjg0MjMyZjll" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMjk1MDFmOGY4NDQ4MzU4NDM4YmMyYzU2NjRmYzMz" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Secretary.” Cornelissen nodded in response, his pure yellow eyes holding Anton’s gaze.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWNhYjY3ZTFhMTQ0M2NhNzE2OWVjZTY5NzkwMzk0" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MzUwMWMyYTk4MDRjNjBiMWRmODExZDQxODY5ODI3" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Would you care for a drink?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2EyNjFkMmFjMDRiMDNhYWJjMTA2ZjVlNWE4MDc5" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYWZlYjg3ZGY5MTQzY2RiNmM1MTZlMjQ0OGU3NzUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWU3M2VmNWFhNzRmMmU4NTc0MmQ4YjU1MzM5MjNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton took a moment to reply. He slurped the coffee before setting it down and resting an arm on the table. “We have much to discuss,” he said. “It’s not often we summon you on the same day you request to speak with us.” Due to recent events in the Cascadian city of Kenhoro, the Federation quickly collected what information they could and summoned the Cascadian ambassador. As fast as they had moved, the Cascadian government had worked equally as quickly and only a few minutes after the summon had been sent they had received the request from Cornelissen.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDI0YzVmMTNlNTQyNThiNjU4ODgwNzVmOWJhZmVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please inform me, Ambassador Cornelissen, what bothers Cascadia?” Anton smiled. Cornelissen was the guest and by having him speak first he could better determine his own moves. Would the demon jump straight into the topic they cared most about, or would he talk around it?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTgwMDMzMmEyYzQ5ZDI5M2UwODYyYTQ2YmNlZTcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Matters of concern,” Cornelissen intoned. “In addition to the current restrictions imposed upon the Federation regarding red crystal exports, Cascadia will immediately cease exporting blue and purple crystals to the Federation. Furthermore, as with red crystal, we will forbid the re-export of those crystals from the Sabanis Dominance. We regretfully take these actions in response to the Federation’s continued </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">encouragement</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the tribal warriors of the Endless Sands to bolster Republican forces.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjhmZWY5MzMzODQ1Y2NiYTNlNzZlODRjOWYwY2Jm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Skirting around the main topic then,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Anton thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWNmY2RhMTYzMTRjZTM5Y2YyMzNjYjRkMWQwM2Y1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nonsense,” Anton immediately protested, keeping his voice calm and his temper measured through decades of political experience. “These tribesmen merely seek to earn a better living and travel to Ironburg for work. We have their visas and documents proving their reason for travel, and we even have copies of the Republican work orders. Do I need to fetch them for you to look at?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTA0MDQ4YjZkNjQ2ZjBhNTQ1NzBjZDNkZDE3ZmNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Regardless of what any documents say, our battalion commanders are reporting an increasing amount of tribesmen on the ground,” the Ambassador’s expression darkened. “Need I remind you of their </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fanatical beliefs?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> The tribesmen believe that by grounding down our horns, they can create ever stronger golems. We have already shown you evidence of the barbaric desecration of demon bodies. Until the Federation prohibits their travel and actively assists Cascadian efforts in stamping down on the illegal horn trade, these restrictions will be maintained.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGY5ZGZiZTIxNzQ5NTY5NGE0NzBiOWI3ZTI4NzBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton felt the faintest pinch of annoyance but quickly quenched it before it could manifest on his face. After Cascadia had restricted the outflow of red-crystal, the Federation needed to rely on less efficient explosive production utilising different crystals. This caused them to come to a mutually beneficial agreement with the desert tribes. The Federation would give them cover and means to travel to the Republic so they could find the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ingredients </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">for their magic, and the Federation would be allowed to mine the desert crystals. Cascadia’s problem was entirely their own making! Anton would love to point this out but couldn’t, as their official public opinion was that Cascadian sanctions did not affect the Federation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGNjYWRlNWU0YjQ4MGM5ODZkNTU1OWMyNjE1MjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, with reduced access to not only the red crystal of the Southern Terra Firma, but the blue crystal of the Eastern Terra Firma and the cold purple crystal of the Northern Terra Firma, the Federation would essentially be publicly cut off from all Cascadian crystal exports. The yellow crystal that fell in Centralis was never exported internationally and the green crystal from the mysterious Western Terra Firma was hoarded by the hidden Overlord. Any attempts the Federation made to establish any kind of relationship with Cascadia’s western territory were met in failure. As far as Anton knew, even Centralis only got a small measured amount of green crystal each year.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjg4MzMxZTAzNjRlOGU4MGM2NmU2MWFlYTIzYzNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, they could get access indirectly. The Bureau had worked hard over the last few years to establish a coherent network in the Sabanis Dominance. Through this network, they would be able to circumnavigate the sanctions. Even so, these activities would weigh on the treasury.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTBhMzY2NzNjOTQ1Y2Y5MmQxYzYxMzQxZTgzNWNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This needed a response.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjczYzQ0YzZmNTQzOTJiNTNiMzJjNzE2OTI4ZTYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Federation is appalled by the horn trade,” Anton said easily. “We, of course, endeavour to catch these smugglers and firmly denounce their activities. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">However…</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Anton narrowed his eyes. “I must firmly protest the choices of your government. You cannot expect to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bully</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> us into restricting the travel of our desert neighbours with whom we have maintained friendly relations for decades. Such an action by us would risk another desert conflict. I would like to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">strongly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> communicate our disapproval of the chosen actions of the Cascadian government. Should you proceed with this path, we will have no option but to impose tariffs on Federation steel, which the Cascadian defence industry</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> runs on</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjU1NjNlZDM0NDQ5N2M5OTdlNzYwNzA2NTI5MDEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Federation was the largest producer of industrial-grade steel in the Known World, and Cascadia, along with Christdom, were their largest customers. Everyone needed steel, and with an ever-larger war on the horizon, the Federation was making more gold than ever. So much gold that they couldn’t risk cutting off exports entirely. The profits of their Cascadian steel trade helped pay for the expenses for alternative crystal sources.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTk4MTQzZDA5MDRmYWZiMzI0ZGQwOGJjOTZlMzJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...I will communicate your message to my government,” Cornelissen responded neutrally. “These tariffs, what percentage would the Federation impose?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGI1ZDgzZmJlMTQ2NjY4YmZhMmY5NTgwZjZiNjdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton gave the figure he was authorised to share. To the demon’s credit, he didn’t show any outward change in expression. Like himself, Calvin Cornelissen was a titanic diplomat. If tensions had not been so high between the Federation and the Empire, they might have even been friends.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTljZjY2ZGUzZjRjMjdiMDIwMDEzYjJiMzhkNjE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDM4YzVkMzFiNjRhNTBiZjgyYjQ4NGJlMmQ1Yzhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are other matters,” the ambassador continued. “We are, once again, greatly concerned about the increasing presence of Federation steam and aethersmiths working in Republican territory. Their assistance to the rebel government only elongates this conflict and means more death than is necessary, both human and demon.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmQ1MmM0ZDczYTRiY2FiNmYwYzZmNjMxOGRkOWFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surely you don’t plan to suggest we restrict the travel of our </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">own </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">citizens?” Anton clasped his hands together. “There are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">many </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">humans from </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">many </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">nations who volunteer their skills for what they believe to be a worthy cause.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDJmMzFjNzBlZDRkMzBiMTBlN2M4YjFlZGI2OTg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">worthy cause? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">The Republic is our overseas territory and has been for nearly a century. The interference of Christdom fanaticism caused this conflict, and the aid from the human nations fuels it. May I remind you of the barbaric attack that started this conflict? The wanton destruction of demon settlements? My government is concerned that continued </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">indirect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> aid by the Federation may indicate a hostile stance.”</span></p><span class="cjE0YzIzNDU3MjVjMTQyZWJhY2Q5ODZiYTc0MzNhOTAx"><br/>This tale has been pilfered from Royal Road.

<p class="cnM5YzkyNDUwMWRhZjQ5YjU4ODhiZTMzZTUxMWMwNjEy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton wanted to smile sarcastically but managed to keep his composure. “May I remind </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that it was the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">massacre</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Republican humans in thirty-nine, a crime against humanity committed by the forces of Greatlord Orlan, that prompted such a… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">visceral</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> reaction?” Anton raised his arms in a disarming manner. “We risk an unproductive argument, Ambassador. The Federation disavows all crimes committed by </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">both</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> sides. We will not prohibit Federation volunteers. We do not believe this makes us a participant in the conflict.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNkYjk0ZWQ1NGJjZDQzY2M4OGQwYWYzN2FjYjUzZDVh" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a participant </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">publicly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Cornelissen’s voice took a hard edge. “For a non-participant, the Federation seems eager to trade munitions and men. I’ve heard terrible rumours that the Federation may begin providing the rebels with ships in a doomed attempt to reconstitute the decimated Republican navy.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWQwMTFlMTA5ZDQxYTJhOTEzMmY2NjNmNjM1NTQx" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1N2YxNTIzOTQwYzQ5ZTJhYzA0YzI2YzMyYTA1MGM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton felt his eyes narrow. How had that information leaked? Before he could respond, Cornelissen continued, “I would like to inform you that should Federation warships be used in Republican airspace to attack our forces, then Cascadia will have no choice but to consider the Federation a direct participant in the conflict.” The demon's eyes flared and an uneasy silence formed between the two men.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzYyMDMzMTExODQ5MWI4YTA2NTc1YzY1NzI4ZDBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ambassador had turned it up a notch, coming on more forceful than usual. Anton took a few measured breaths and responded, “I do not believe these rumours of yours have any merit, but I will communicate your concern with my superiors. An answer will be delivered as soon as feasible.” Anton held the demon’s gaze until the ambassador nodded, satisfied.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGM1Mzk4OGZiNjQyYjI4MmZmMjQ2MzExOTc1MWE3" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is one final matter to discuss,” Cornelissen began.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWMwZjBkNjdlYzRlODA4M2ZhYTEzNDE3ZTUxNTE5" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4M2RkZjU3NzdlNzQ5Mjg4MTc0NGMzYzJlY2MyMmM0" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Here it comes,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Anton thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmI4NGIxYzdiZTQyMjViZTZlODY3NDY5YTA3OWFj" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5OTk2ZGJmNTE4YTQ0M2Y5YmFhMDI3NzgyNWRlNWI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have been instructed by the Empress </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">directly </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">to raise with you the issue of the terrorist attack committed by Federation agent Polina Volkova against the civilian transport </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakamoto</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> three days ago. Furthermore, we are concerned about her interaction with the human Amelia Thornheart, now known as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thornheart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODQ4YjY4MmJhZTRlYWE4MDlkNGU3ZmJhYjgxZGM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite Anton’s extensive experience, he felt a bead of sweat form and his heart race. “Lord-Prospect?” he asked a moment too late for it to seem natural.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2Q3ZTQ3YWE2MTQ2NTNiZDE1MDM2ZDMxYmQ4MjM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quite. Lord-Prospect Thornheart has formally and willfully been incorporated as a citizen of the Empire.” The ambassador had a glint in his eye, like a predator eyeing his prey. “Due to her magical talent and her heroic actions in preventing so many deaths during the terror attack committed by Polina Volkova, she has been awarded the title of Lord-Prospect. As I speak to you, all our other ambassadors are informing their respective counterparts of this information.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTM2ZTdiN2RkOTRhMzliNzExZDVmYjA3MmFmNzc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Curse it! Christdom had moved too slowly! Anton knew the Vatican was on the brink of announcing Amelia Thornheart as their kidnapped saint. They had, along with the Federation, planned to use this as justification to expand Republican aid. What could Cascadia do after the Pope - God's messenger on earth - announced to all of humankind that Amelia Thornheart was a captured and manipulated saint!? They would have had to give her up, lest they risk a crusade!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDA5OTBiYzg2OTQ2YWY4Mjk1NTcxY2I5YjlkZTVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If they went ahead with that plan now, it would have a muted effect, being seen as a frustrated </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">reaction</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. If this news was true, then instead of presenting a case of humankind’s noble fight for a lost saint, it would be seen as challenging the very idea of statehood and citizenship!</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2U5ZDJlYzcwMjRhNzRhMTFhNmJhMGE3YzM1N2U2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As if reading his mind, the ambassador continued, “Of course, should you wish to verify Lord-Prospect Thornheart’s loyalty to Cascadia, we would happily arrange a meeting with the Federation Ambassador in Centralis.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDZjYmRiZDEzMzRiNzQ5ZTgzMTg1ZTIwNDMyODY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Tap tap tap</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Anton tapped the table. His mind churned. He would need to be careful. Once he had chosen his words, he took another moment to keep his voice calm. “We have, of course, been aware of Amelia Thornheart’s existence. Her name is in all the papers; ‘the mysterious lost Speaker of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco’</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">… Are you not concerned about how the Vatican will respond to this? They may see it as provocative.” </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Provocative</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was an understatement. This was a daring move by Cascadia that could trigger a direct war with Christdom.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTA3MmY5NjRjZjQwMzdhNWFhY2NiNWVlZTc4M2Q3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are confident the Pope would not be so rash,” Cornelissen answered. “As you know, our ambassador to Christdom has long been expelled so we are resorting to communicating with the Vatican through diplomatic channels in Ulm. We understand that there may be concerns of a diplomatic incident considering Lord-Prospect Thornheart’s ability to Speak </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">; however, the Empress is confident that by welcoming this human Speaker into Cascadian nobility, we can remind the world once again that demons and humans can live side-by-side, in mutual benefit.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjg3NjllZDFlOTQyOWFhMmNmZGZhMjAzOWZkOWY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">As if</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Anton thought. If there was one consistent trend of the last few decades it was the increasing tension of human-demon relations. As these relations had fallen, something else was building up in their wake. Something ominous and dreadful. Christdom was building their new fleets as they spoke. Centralis was constructing </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">capital</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> ships and in response to both, the Federation had no choice but to expand its navy for national security. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTRkOTZlMDkwYjQyOWNhZTg1NzFjOGUyNjQ2ZDA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn it! If Cascadia wanted to avoid conflict so much, then why didn’t they just go home? Couldn’t they see how unacceptable it was for a demon territory to be established on the human continent? For the millions of Republican humans to be ruled by their demon demigod? Wasn’t their continent big enough?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzY3OTFlZjY5YjQyYWI5NGYxNzkxMTJlMWQyZTU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We, of course, agree,” Anton responded. “Successful human-demon relations is something the Federation always strives for. We are merely concerned that this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">particular</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> human and the events surrounding her could cause unintended consequences.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTYzMjExZmRiNzQ1YTdhZDBhOWUzZTNhNGFjOTc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of consequences,” Cornelissen continued. “May we turn the discussion to the terrorist Polina Volkova? We have avoided raising this matter publicly, hoping that perhaps we can settle it quietly first.” The ambassador produced a warm smile that made Anton feel like shivering.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDEyMzk5Mjk0MTQ0ODZhYWFiZGZkNTZkMDI2Zjgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was going to cost them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjRjYzMwMmFlYzRkNzRiMjM4Njc1ZTMwNzg0MTY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Federation didn’t know what in the six heavens had caused the events that ended in the downing of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakamoto</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.

<p class="cnMwNmQyNTYwNGZkNTQ5NzZhMmZjY2Q5YzIzYTYyZjE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“First and foremost,” Anton began, “We would like to inform Cascadia that the terrible and unfortunate event that transpired is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">categorically</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> disavowed by the Federation, and we were all relieved to find no innocent civilians were harmed-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTE3Y2JkZjdjNzRkNzk5OTJmYzQ4MjA2MGU5Y2E3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks to the talent of Lord-Prospect Thornheart,” Cornelissen interrupted. “I believe you are aware there were a small number of Federation citizens on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakamoto</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> who would have surely perished had it not been for her magic?”</span></p>

<p class="cnMwNGM3ZWM0NDkxNzQxNjFhNTEwYmQwYmE1M2RiMTMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thornheart, Secretary,” Cornelissen said with a smile. “Let’s not disrespect her, even if we’re so far away, by ignoring her noble title.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTZmYzE2Y2E5ZjQ5ZWM5NjAwYmVmZDA0YjU0MmIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thornheart, yes.” Anton spent a fraction of a second clenching his jaw and then forced his face into a relaxed expression. “Furthermore, if it wasn’t clear, we would like to inform your government that these events were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">absolutely </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">not an intended outcome and should we have been aware of the possibility of it happening, then we would have expended every effort to stop it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWMwZDdmMTc5NjRjMGI5NTM0YWE5NzQxZTI5NjE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some might suggest not establishing intelligence cells to spy on our ships and citizens would be a good first step.” The ambassador punctuated his statement by relaxing into his chair. Anton knew as well as Cornelissen did that fieldwork like this was an established practice between Cascadia and the human kingdoms. Still, that didn’t mean they openly admitted such a thing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmQ2YmI2NjI0NzRhNGNiYTAxYzRkNGFhNDZkOGUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We would like to discuss transferring this… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">rogue</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> agent into Federation custody,” Anton began, producing a slip of paper from his inner pocket. He passed the slip to the ambassador. “I’m sure you recognise these names.” The paper contained a list of Cascadian spies the Federation had caught and were serving lengthy prison sentences. “We would like to offer an exchange for any two names of your choosing. In addition, we will pay for all repairs for the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakamoto</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTk5OGM4ZGY2ZjRlYzY4ODEyNTQyZDNmYzNlOWEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ambassador glanced up from the list before slowly placing it on the table. “A tempting offer, Secretary, however…” the demon's eyes narrowed. “Considering the unique </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">talent</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Polina Volkova, a mere two names isn’t going to cut it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTA4ZjMxMDkyYTRjZmE5NzRjZGM1NDRmNjNjOGQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah shit,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Anton thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">They know about her blessing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDMxNWMxOGJlMjQ2MWVhOWZlZTZkNDU1YWNjM2Vj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He locked eyes with the demon for longer than was polite. “How many names to satisfy Cascadia?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTRjZGQ5OTBkZjQ2NDZiZWY5ZjRmMmZmMDUxNDE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of them.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGM4ZTk0OWJmNzQwZGRhMGNkYWQ5Njg1ODk5NmI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Impossible</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Anton stated firmly. “There is a limit, Ambassador. There is only so far we can stretch. Eight names.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjhiN2M2MzBhNjRmODc5OWRjMDQwOTVlOGVhMGUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fifteen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjU4NTY0MWZmMzQyYzA4MGEzYWIzOGZiNTg0ZDM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ten, and we’ll double the payment for the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakamoto</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzI2NjFjYTEzMTQ1OGRhM2ZmNjk2N2VlMTAzMjBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Twelve</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> names and you’ll pay for the Sakamoto and an additional hundred thousand denarii in compensation. This is our offer,” Cornelissen said with an element of finality.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNThkMDU4MTFjMzQ2YzJiZDIzYjljMGI3N2I1ZDJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton forced himself to slow down. He took a sip of his coffee, finding its now-cold bitterness entirely suitable for the atmosphere. “I will need to discuss this with my superiors,” he said. “Ambassador, would you care to stay within the Red Citadel until we can sort this out?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjRlNTcwNmUxYzRhYWNiM2RjZTlmMjdmNDJiYjg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Certainly,” Cornelissen replied. “Please understand that if I need to communicate with my government, I must do so from our embassy.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzkxM2ZiYWQ1MDQ4ZDJhMmM5ZDA1MTM0ZDk3Yzdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course,” Anton said with a nod. Aetherfield communication was easily eavesdropped and so sensitive discussions over it required encryption. Demon cryptography had only recently caught up with human innovation and the embassy communications they had easily listened in on previously were now resistant to their efforts.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzcyYjgzMmQzMDQyZDU5MTUzZjAwNGYwMTVkNzM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two men settled on some further details and soon they covered everything their respective governments had requested of them. Anton stood up first, trying to regain some feeling of control.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmYxMjg4NmI2ZDRiYmE4YjBiZWZjMjM3ZmFhZGQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ambassador, thank you for your time.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTYzMGE1NWUzYTQ5NThiZGYzYWRkZjVjMzFjODA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thank </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Secretary,” Cornelissen said cooly. “One last quick matter…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTljOTdmNjMzNTRkODU4NjYzZDMzYmYwOTBkMjk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjYxNGY4MWI2ZTQ0ODViZDE5YjBhNmVjOWY0Zjlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A colleague of Polina Volkova, an individual identified by </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Natalia Marakova</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> has escaped our capture and seriously wounded several city guards. We know she’s still in Kenhoro, hiding away in some safe house…” Cornelissen eyes narrowed. “Instead of further conflict and risk of casualties, we’d much rather arrange a time where our guards outside the Federation embassy can look away for a few minutes and allow her to return to Federation hands. See it as…” the ambassador looked thoughtful momentarily. “...a gesture of goodwill.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDk5YWI4ZDcxNTRmOTI4ODM0NTc2ZmJlZGVmMmI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“... I understand,” Anton responded after a moment's hesitation. “I will communicate this to my superiors.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDMyY2ZiMTM2NjQ5ZThiYzEyOTJkMzc4M2NkYTM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWEyZDc5MjIzYzQ0NzJiNGRlNjUyMmYzNGNlZDcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton called the guard in and Calvin Cornelissen was led away. For a long while after the demon was gone, Anton stood staring into space. How had all this happened? How had one human Speaker caused so much insanity to take place? How did their Intelligence Operatives, with the aid of a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">truth-teller</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, find out </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so little</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> about her?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzY0MmYwZTU2NzQxYTZiNmIwZGFmZGJlMzhlMjdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Who the hell was Amelia Thornheart?</span></p>

<p class="cnM0OTA1ODhiOTM4ZDRhNTM5ZTI5NjdkNGIwOTVjZTk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGU2ZmVjZjFiNTQ5Yjc4ZWNiYWMzMTY3YmFkNTI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right then, this looks good enough.” Serena held up her hand, feeling the strength and direction of the wind. Her gunners would need to adjust slightly, but for a crew as experienced as hers, they would hit the target easily enough.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGIzYTk1ZTI4MTRlN2U5ZWYzYTY3OGMwZTAxOWU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sure</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> this is a real training method?” The target in question complained before putting her hands on her hips and pouting. “You’re not making this up so you can shoot your adorable girlfriend, are you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmRhZTFmN2IxMjQwMzU5NzczMGExNWY5NGRiYTVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt a sly smile form but otherwise chose not to reply immediately.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTVkMTAxOGZlMTQ2ZGI4MzU3Yjk0MzBlZjBlOWY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They’d set sail from Shimashina that morning. After clearing the aetherscope range of the city’s perimeter ships, Serena ordered the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a few dozen klicks away from the regular travel route and found a small mid-sky island floating six klicks above the continent. Dagon had taken command as acting captain while Serena and Amelia jumped the few dozen meters down onto the island with their training equipment.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmY2MDJiMGQ0NjRiMjU5ODA2NTA1ZjVjYWNjZjBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With only a few thousand square feet and a handful of trees, the island was mostly unremarkable. One thing of note was that the island was lumina-locked; without significant external force the island would maintain its current location and elevation perpetually. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjk5Mjk4YzJjOTQwMzQ5Y2VkNTc5NzhhMDhjNjIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lumina-locking occurred naturally and artificially. The military used the technology to capture islands and use them as entrenched defensive artillery positions or early-warning aetherscope installations. In the hands of the rich and powerful, luxury islands and private resorts were traded on the markets. Serena once heard that a Centralis merchant took a particular liking to an island floating around Fengra and had - at tremendous cost - it transported all the way to Centralis.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGE5OGIxZmU1YTQwMzRhNTM3OWUwZjRhYjNmMDcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena shook her head, both at the thought of owning an entire island and at Amelia’s question regarding training. Once a mage or a warrior became proficient with their aether control, they would be put through this gauntlet. Even if someone’s talents meant they were now effectively resistant to bullets, their previous instincts often took a while to adjust.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTVkMjMwZDRjNTQyNDZhMGUzZWI2NDg2NWZjM2Qx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re essentially immune to conventional weapons,” Serena explained to the pouting target dummy. “Even if you know this, the demon body - I mean - the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human body</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, will react naturally when untrained. For example…” Serena unholstered her pistol and shot Amelia in the stomach. Amelia tensed a bit as her wards easily defended against the bullet. Her girlfriend gave her a tilted look which seemed to say, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM1NGZiMTU1MmExNTQ2N2M4YjM0OGMxNTY1YjEyNGNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re better than before,” Serena said with a smile. “Before, you would jump like a surprised </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">peeka</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. You need to eradicate all </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">normal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> reactions to gunfire and being hit. In a fight you cannot waste time with things that cannot harm you!” Serena picked up a rifle and aimed it at Amelia, causing the woman to clench her fists and hold her breath. “Don’t anticipate the shot,” Serena informed her. “A rifle bullet will go straight through </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">several</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> soldiers without stopping. It is wards and aura that stop a bullet, not tensed muscles! Focus on strengthening your wards!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzIzZWIwYjAzODRhMGU5MzljODI2MmVlZDAwYTQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A subtle pulse in the aetherfield informed Serena Amelia had done precisely that. With her girlfriend’s skill at cloaking her magic, that subtle pulse likely reflected a titanic amount of reinforcement that would drain the reserves of any normal mage in seconds. “Ready?” Serena asked. The moment Amelia nodded Serena pulled the trigger and a thunderous boom sounded as the rifle bullet slammed into Amelia. The woman squeaked and took a step back.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTZjMjE2MzkxZTQ2NGNiNTNjMTA2ZjY5MzM4NDBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you can see,” Serena explained once the smoke had cleared. “Even if your wards protect you, the bullet's momentum must go somewhere. You might be able to take a cannon shell directly, but that same cannon shell could launch you out and away from the battlefield. Remember when Korvus and his men tried to assassinate you? You survived, but the forces flipped you over, and you lost your bearings?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzVlODM4ODBmZDQzMzg5ZmMxNWIxOWQ5OTZkNzky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Amelia replied, eyeing the rifle warily. “It’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> much louder than the pistol. I can’t help but react! How can I ignore something like that with my enhanced hearing?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzAzNzNjODdkNjRhN2E4YzliNGQwMzZmODA4YWJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good question. Suppression through noise and chaos is one of the best ways to limit the effectiveness of enemy Speakers.” Serena remembered the field manuals describing the recommended amount of munitions to throw in the grid square of a Speaker to prevent their effective command. She had, on more than one occasion, been subject to such a barrage.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWY2ZDdmZWIwZDQ4NDg4NTQwMmFmMjc5YWU3Njdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are ways warriors can manipulate their aura to protect their ears. Some of my previous squad commanders preferred to fight practically deaf so they could focus on the aetherfield and their eyes. From what I’ve heard, mages can do something similar.” She operated the rifle's bolt handle, loading another round. “Ready? I’ll keep shooting you. Focus on your reaction and your ears.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDc1YzAzZjY0ZDQ5OGQ4NTlhZTYxYTU2OTE0MWU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The one-sided assault began as Amelia took bullet after bullet against her warded torso. After two dozen rounds she stopped reacting so noticeably but would still cringe if she saw the weapon aimed at her head. Serena explained that while it was a natural reaction, Amelia’s head and even her eyes were as protected by her wards as her torso. Once Amelia had gotten used to her head and face being targeted, Serena had her turn around so she couldn’t see the shot coming.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDQyNzIxZjRjZDRkOGQ4ZDkxN2Y3ZDg2YzA1OTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After another fifty rounds at the back of Amelia’s head, the human stopped jumping entirely. Next, Serena ordered her to practice her kata while under fire. This was a repeat of some of the training she had undertaken in Kenhoro, although Serena and Grandmaster Gu had used a small calibre pistol.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWM3ZmY1NmQxMzQ3NTU5YTNiMGJlYmYxZDAyNmM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good, now draw your sword,” Serena instructed after half an hour. “We’ll lightly duel, and I’ll show you how firearms can be used in Speaker swordfights. I’ll stick to orange. Try and match me.” Serena drew her sword and Amelia followed suit. She had been given a soldier’s sword from the ship’s armoury. “We’ll keep it sharp and fast, no strong moves, lest one of us is thrown off the island.” If that were to happen, both could Speak and return to the island by flaring their aether against the lumina, but it wouldn’t be ideal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTU0ZDZjZGRmYTQ4OGQ5ZjllNmQwZjU1MGFmMmFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After the traditional pre-spar bow, Serena moved her aether into orange and began her attack. Amelia had become quite proficient with the Grandmaster as her instructor but she still fell short against Serena’s experience. Her assault kept Amelia’s defences on the brink of collapsing. In between the stabbing and thrusting, Serena began slipping her pistol through gaps in Amelia’s defence and letting off a shot point-blank. The first few times, it caused Amelia’s defence to collapse entirely. Eventually, she got used to the tactic and could ignore the pistol.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTlhNGQ3YTdmYzRjMmY5ZjQ4ZDc1ZjA2NDMyYzdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enough,” Serena commanded, stopping the duel and bowing. “You learn fast, Amelia.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTY1ZjU4YzY1NDQ4NjU5MjBkOWQ0MmZmMjQ0NDdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded, retying her hair. “It was scary at first, but I’ve got a grip on my hearing! One thing I’ve been thinking of is that all this training is to get used to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ignoring</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> firearms, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWRjNzkwYTE3ZTQzM2VhYTg3MGFhYjBjNjU1OTkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Serena said with a nod.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjc2OTJjNjc0OTQ1NWNhNTNlMTdhZWQzZTc0NjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But now we know there are firearms with black-crystal rounds. Isn’t it a little…” Amelia shrugged. “Counter-intuitive?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDJiNWZlNzk1MzQ2Y2JhYTA1YmVhZGJiNTFjYjY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve never heard of a single example of those rounds being used,” Serena explained, shaking her head. “While we might become a target of the Darkblades, it sounds like the amount of black crystal is far and few between. The vast majority of firearms we’ll face will almost certainly be conventional.” The abhorrent existence of black moon crystals was easily detected by anyone in the vicinity with an ounce of aetherfield perception.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTFiM2ViZDI1NDQ1MTU4NjE0MDFkOTc2OWQwMmE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At their final meeting at the Shimashina airdocks, Chesterfield informed her that the reason behind the Kenhoro Greatlord’s sudden interest in the Crimson Reaver’s cargo was a tiny bag of black-crystal fragments discovered in one of the crates. He had also implied that the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Salinas</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speakers they battled were in Kenhoro to oversee its transportation and it was Serena and Amelia’s interference at Lord Yulan’s Highguard Hotel that prompted the cafe attack.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmEwOGY2YTQ0MzQ0MTE5NzZmYTc0ZDkwZjlkZjdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t know if those Speakers were Darkblades themselves, but that insidious group was certainly pulling the strings. Anathor told her that wherever black crystal was to be found, the Darkblades would be nearby. She tightened her fists, feeling determination and anger rise. No matter what, she would do her part in destroying the sworn enemies of the Empress and the Empire!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGQ5NzRkMDFmOTQ3ZGY5NTJkN2E5ZmU4ZmM1N2M1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey! You've got that look in your eye!” Amelia exclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODJiNmNjMjkyNTRmY2I4ZWJkZTVhOTQ1MjZjN2Nh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What look?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2Y1ZTFmZTQ3ZjQ4ZjE4YTMxNDFlMTcwYzhlNjI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The look where you’re thinking about shooting and stabbing someone other than me!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzBkOGY2MmNlYTQ1ZjE4OGFlMzFiOGU0OTZhNTY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This idiot!</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjI1YTkyNjY1YzQ1YTViNDQ5MzdiMzQwY2RiYjQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then!” Serena declared, “Let’s correct that grievance! Back up a few meters!” She motioned with her hands and Amelia retreated. “You’ve got control over your hearing, right?” Seeing Amelia nod, Serena moved the equipment into a depression in the earth and fished out two handflags, one green and the other red.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTFiN2IzZjYxYjRiZTRhYWNhZTRmNTE4YjgzY2E1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Flags?” Amelia asked. “What are they for?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGRlZDI3OWQ4NTQ5YmZiODQ2ODkxZWNmYTljMzk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Communication,” Serena replied. She turned towards the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Dagon had manoeuvred the ship to hover at the same elevation as the island, approximately half a klick away. At this distance, an average person might struggle to make out details but for Serena and the observers on deck, it was not a problem. At this distance, they could probably hear each other shouting, but using flags was the military norm. Serena raised the flags, one in each hand, and made a series of gestures.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTdhYzA0NzBjZDRmMjA5NzJmNWJmODk5ZWJhYjUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ship. Receive</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

Brace yourself.” She pushed her aura into yellow.</span></p><span class="cmMzZTI0NjAxZjVkNjQ3MWRiMDRkZWYxNDYwMjEzODIw"><br/>This story is posted elsewhere by the author.

<p class="cnM4MDkyNDc3ZjgyYTQ1Njg5ZWUwOWU1ZWMyODhmMzBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDkwZDM2NTU1NTQyZTFiZWRiYTE1MTQ0MDQ5YmQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The heavy flak turret turned in their direction, its six barrels pausing only a moment before spewing fire and fury. With a muzzle velocity almost three times the speed of sound the first shells hit their location before the gun had finished its burst.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWM4ZmMxNWI2NjRiMjFhNGZjNzEzNDMxYjVmZTNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thirty-eight flak rounds impacted the earth, exploding with black smoke, throwing up dirt and spraying fragmentation. Despite experiencing this level of barrage before, Serena couldn’t help but grit her teeth. Each shell sent a shockwave and a wall of fragmentation that impacted her aura.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTU3NzYxZDFhNjRiOWY4MDFiZDhmZmQ1YTdlOGVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuck!” Amelia spun around, tripping on her feet and falling over. “Christ!” As quickly as it began, it ended, and after a moment of relative silence where only the sound of falling twigs and leaves could be heard, Serena helped Amelia to her feet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yjg3MWRkOWZiMDQ1YjhhM2ZkYjJiODBjOTRkZWVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“More intense than you would think, isn’t it?” Serena dusted Amelia’s shoulders. “And that wasn’t even directly at you. Like I said before, war is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">loud</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Are you okay?” Amelia didn’t swear often, so Serena was a little concerned. Amelia was powerful but didn’t have the mental constitution of a soldier. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDc2YzM3NTFiMTRlZTdhNmM2Njg4ZWY5NTEwODI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia sniffed. “Sorry. It was so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">overwhelming</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. My wards held fine, of course… but even so… dammit, I’m crying!” Tears had formed in her crimson eyes. “I’m not even sad! Why am I crying!? Ah, how embarrassing!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzZiYWFjMGI2YTQ0YjliYmViZDgyNmExM2MzZTkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s normal,” Serena explained. “The intensity of war. It happens with new soldiers </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">all the time</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Trained men, crying in the trenches under their first barrage. Throwing up and pissing themselves. Those are tears of frustration from the feeling of being powerless under the barrage of shells. Of course, you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">aren’t</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> powerless, but your body doesn’t quite understand that. Want to end it here for today</span><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDdjOGNiNmE5NzRmMWU4N2ZkNTVjZTAwYzQ0ZjJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fine</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Amelia sighed, wiping her eyes. “I’ll get used to it. What’s next?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjc4NmU0ODg5YTQwMTg5YWYzNGRjMTVjMzU1ZDMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Same again, try not to fall over this time. I’ll stand next to you.” Serena signalled the order to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and a few seconds later the heavy flak thundered next to them again. Once the dirt had settled and the smoke dissipated, Serena was pleased to see Amelia faring much better.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmQ1Y2Q0MmFmODQ3NDc5MDQzYmZkNTAwOTIwZjNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it weird that even though I know it’s training, being shelled like this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">angers </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">me?” Amelia raised the question with clenched fists. “If it was another ship, I would be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> tempted to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">respond</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGUxYTQ0NzcwNTQxYWE4N2VhMDIwODYwY2I2OTY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very normal. Anger can be a good emotion on the battlefield when it can be used to overcome fear and hesitation but be careful not to lose yourself in it and get others killed.” Serena glanced at the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. “Want to try the same at our location?” After Amelia nodded with a face tense with determination, Serena gave the command.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmIwYzIyM2MzZTQzNDI5MTE0ZGQ5NzM4ODkyNzNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavy Flak. Two-second burst. On Target. Confirm.</span></em></p>

<p class="cnMwMDdhNzA5MTVkMDQxNGZhNmJhMTAwOGVlZGVmN2Nl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, turn and face me,” Serena said as the impeding barrage was moments away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGY1MTgzNTRmMTQxZjJiZDFkM2FkYzkzMDg4MGEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, you look so pretty under shellfire.” Amelia intoned sarcastically.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2QwZDUxMzgxNDQzZTZiMGJmZGE4Nzc5YzM2NjUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTA1ZjA5MGFkNTRlNjliMTJhNjM1ODY1Y2NhNDMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“These date ideas of yours are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so romantic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Here I thought you’d take me out to a candlelit dinner, and instead…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDM0ODA1NDAyNDRmMGNhZWJkNDJmYzMzZjk2ZTk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTNlM2ViMDMyMTQ2YzRhYTYwNmM5ZDg2YjFlOTUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena was cut off as the world exploded. The smoke blinded her, and her yellow ward rippled as she took a direct hit.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDU0MWJkNjNkOTQwMzc4NWM0NjRlOWM4MmVhY2Y2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bloody hell!” Amelia exclaimed from somewhere in the smoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTk2NjU4NDBhMTQwOGRhN2RiNjI2MmRmMTYwZDIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">On a sudden impulse, before the smoke cleared, Serena reached out and pulled Amelia close, stealing a kiss. “Mmph” Amelia quickly relaxed into the moment of intimacy and it was Serena who had to push her away as the smoke thinned.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmI2YzI0MzNjYTQ0NWZiMDRiZDczYWE4ZmNjMDAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see anger isn’t the only intense emotion under shellfire,” Amelia said with a grin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTNmMThiNjliMzQ2OWNiNDZjZWM1NzA0YmEyM2M2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… taste of gunpowder,” Serena said, licking her lips.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjMwZmIxY2E1MjRkOGRhZmEwZDU4MTI3NDQyZDk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder why?” A quick burst of magic and Amelia and Serena were spotless. They stood there awkwardly for a moment before Amelia asked, “Hey, does the military use smoke rounds? I remember we had something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2NlNzZmMGI4ZjRjNDI5NmM3Nzg3NzZiYzhlNmJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Serena nodded. “Although their usage is very situational. It’s good to smoke out a Speaker, but it’s only a temporary measure as they can easily relocate. It also prevents you from seeing them, so careful consideration is needed. We also have illumination rounds for nighttime.” The illumination rounds were more for the regular soldiers. Even a warrior with only red aura could see well enough in the dark.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzAyNmU5YjdhMjQ1YWZiNWU4NDFkN2Q1MDBiMDc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm! Understood!” Amelia nodded. “What’s next? You’re not going to nuke me, are you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWI4Nzg3MDM4MDQyMjY4OTg5NTg2MDIyYTE1NjI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena tilted her head at the unfamiliar phrase. “Nuke?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDg2OWNjOGIyZjRhZjg4MjQzZGI2NWZlMWFlYTUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, oh…” Amliea trailed off, her voice suddenly becoming quiet. “It’s an expression from my realm. A nuke is a, um…” She wiggled her hands. “A big bomb. Bigger than anything your military has.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDcyNTE5MzIzNzRlMzZhMDUzNjQwOTZlZGVlMjg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Our heavy bombers carry some </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">big</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> bombs,” Serena replied. One mission she had undertaken was to be the advance scout of a bombing run on the Republican lines. Those heavy bombers carried bombs weighing </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">three thousand</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> pounds that could level any fortified structure.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmU1MDJkZTZkNTQ2MWM4ZDM3MzljYzhjZmNjOTAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guarantee it’s bigger than whatever you’re thinking of,” Amelia explained. “Remember the story about the Empress speaking the Third Word and creating the Shattered Isles? It’s that level of power.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWIyYzQ0NDhlMTRmMGY4ZDJlYTJhY2ZjYTFkYjU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena was taken aback. “In a bomb?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDI2ZWUwMmM4ODQxY2JhOWU2OTU1OTkyYzdiMjQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDVmZGJlNDNjODQwNTY4MDRiY2JiMjJmM2Y0MTdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How big is the bomb?” The entire Empire probably didn’t produce enough explosives yearly to match the power of a Third Word. Even if the technology of Amelia’s realm had more advanced explosives, such a device would need to be enormous. How would it even be delivered? By one of those ships that Amelia claimed could travel to other planets?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmY4M2U1YjcwMTRiZjNiN2RjYTg1ODA5YzlkMjhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“About… this size?” Amelia spread her arms about a meter apart.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGUxOWIzNTQ4MjQwYmFhNGNmYjMxYzNkZGQxZTkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surely you jest,” Serena shook her head. “Explosives can’t be that powerful.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTBkM2Y5NzA5YjQ2M2ZhMWM4MzExN2UyMmRkZGZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, it doesn’t use explosives. Well, not the kind you’re thinking of. It uses a different mechanism entirely,” Amelia explained.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2Q5ZDEwN2EyZDQ1MGE4ZTkzZTcyNjdmZjY0Nzdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What type of mechanism?” Serena frowned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmRjMWU4ZjlkYjQ1YTJhNTc2YTc2MDQzNjA1YzQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, uh…” Amelia hesitated. “I’d rather not say. In fact, it was a mistake to bring it up; I’m sorry. Actually, can you promise me you won’t mention this to anyone else? It’s a weapon that devasted my world on more than one occasion. Imagine if every nation could just produce Third-Word Speakers by the thousands? It’s a disaster waiting to happen.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2YzNmExZDExZjRlZjQ4OTFiYmFlNWE1MzU2YTI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena hesitated for a moment. “Alright, I promise. However, tell me one thing. Is this weapon something the Enemy could produce?” She felt a dash of relief seeing Amelia shake her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjQyZjdlNDE1NTRiNWU4NWE1YzUxODg0NzI5ODlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No - I don’t even know if the materials to make it exist in this realm. It might be possible for you in… maybe a century? I don’t know; this world focuses more on magic development and its applications. The lumina might mean it’s impossible…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzA1M2I4OTI0ZDQ1ODY5YzQzNDNjYzUzZDhjYmY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena nodded. “Don’t worry about it, I won’t tell anyone.” She made a mental note to bring this up with Amelia in the future. A century was not a long time, and if such a weapon was possible in this realm, it was vital for Cascadia to develop it first. Still, she could sense when Amelia could be pushed for more information and could tell the woman would lock up if she prodded any more.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTQwYjE3ZDFiMDRlYWViYzFhZjMxNTZmODMxZGI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ready for the final tests?” Serena asked, changing the subject. “Instead of taking fire directly, I thought it would be a good idea to test your fieldwards against the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> cannon fire.” Serena knew mages could cast their wards externally, much like a warrior would cloak their weapon with their aura. However, the strength of Amelia’s spellwork and her ability to fuel wards over large distances was an enormous shock to her. She had long hoped to test these wards and see if Amelia could potentially ward the entire ship in combat.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzZlMWEzOWM5MzQyY2E5MTkzNzUyODQwYTE0N2Q0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pick a first-circle ward and cast it between those two trees,” Serena gestured at the trees that had suffered a barrage of fragmentation. “Don’t cloak it; let it be visible to the gunners. We’ll start at the lowest ward and work our way up.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2Q5NmE1MGU2YzRlYzc5M2Q4N2ViNDc5N2ZjMTA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTE2NzY1MDFhYjQ1ZTliMjliMzgwZTM5M2FmYmM0" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena sensed Amelia’s aether boil, and a moment later, a translucent crimson ward formed between the two trees. It shimmered and danced like a flame. Serena peered close. “Is that…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjRhOTdlYjIyZDRjYzM5MjcwZjc0NGIxOWVlODVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni’s Barrier,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> yup!” Amelia nodded happily. She had cast the entry-level ward of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the first demon god of hellfire. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2ZhMjNkNzkxMTQ3NzM4MDFkOWM3ZTE3Y2M4YTc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s give it a shot then,” Serena raised her flags.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWRhMzlkYmI2NzRjMzJhYmEyNzA3M2IwNWU1MDU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Main cannon. Explosive shell. Single. Target ward. Confirm.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiZTI1MDFiN2U2MDQyNjFiNjZlOWRkNzA0Yjk1ZWI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming the order, one of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">main twin-barreled turrets turned. A singular barrel roared into life and the four-inch shell impacted Amelia’s ward at twice the speed of sound. The explosion ripped the trees apart and both Serena and Amelia were forced to step back from the shockwave.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTBlYTA1ODgwZDRlY2U4ZjZkOWY5OThiYjY0NGRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After the smoke cleared, Serena was surprised to see the ward standing firm. “You… you didn’t reform it, right?” she asked Amelia, who shook her head. Seven hells! She knew Amelia’s spellwork was powerful, but to see a first-circle ward withstanding a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">cannon shell!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> First circle spells and red aura were supposed to resist only small arms fire! Amelia’s weakest spells were as powerful as a talented mage’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">third-circle</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> wards!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDQ2NTc1YmZmYTQ1MjM4NGRlMzZjNGUzNzUwNWY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She wasn’t done yet. She signalled the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> once again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Full broadside. Confirm.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMwMWNiNTQ5NmIzNzRlOTFhOGFlMTFiZjNkN2UxZmIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The second turret turned and, with its brothers, spoke in anger as they launched four four-inch explosive shells into Amelia’s ward. It was a barrage that had destroyed many an enemy fortification and felled more than a few Republican vessels. The resulting explosion caused Amelia to fall over and Serena to stagger. She kept her eyes peeled at the moment of the explosion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjE5YWMzODZiZDRhNmU4OThiZGQzOTJlNzRlOGEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s ward wavered but still didn’t break. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWFkOGVjYTEwZjQwYjc5MjFkYmNmMWJjM2ZiODJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ridiculous!</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTQ2NDJmY2ZjZjRmZmU4OTU4NzBkNWU5YTU2MTM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe!” Amelia chirped as she clambered to her feet. “Guess you’re going to need a bigger cannon! What!?” Serena caught herself glaring at her girlfriend.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGJhYmE1ZmNkNTRiODRiNDRmMGYwYmEwYWZhZDcw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apologies, I’m just used to my cannons doing a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">normal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> amount of damage to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">normal </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">wards. Tsk!” Serena turned and waved her flags. If this didn’t penetrate Amelia’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">weakest</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> spell, then she’d surely grab her horns in frustration and cry!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmI3OWE1MGJiNzQ5MWJhNDI2YmEwYTllMWQxNzI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Full broadside. Penetrator rounds. Confirm.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMzNGUzZTZlMjUwZjQzOWNiOGI2MjYwNTg0Mjg2OTM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tungsten was a rare and expensive metal in Cascadia. They had to import most of the ore from the Federation, and so little was mined domestically that tungsten rounds were rationed. They were supposed to be used against truly hardened targets, such as heavy cruisers or battleships.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjQ2NDc5ZjdiYTQ1OTJiMWIzYTk0MWRjZDQwYzQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Or one smug human’s wards.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGI1NmY4ZTFmMzQ2YjJiNGE2M2JhYjdmOTU4OTQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The cannons fired, and Serena only caught a glimpse of the shells in flight before they pierced straight through Amelia’s wards, through the hundred feet of earth and exploded out the other side of the island taking with them a significant chunk of its mass.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWZjMGUyZjFmYzQ4OWI4YTQ5ZDlmMmU1ZDAzMzVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!” she declared triumphantly. “Guess you’re going to need a bigger ward!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDgwZDEyZDBlNjRmZjU5MDlkOTM5NjVkNTRmMjNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia bounced to her side, clapping her hands. “Well done!” she said with a smile. “You defeated my </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">weakest</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> spell! Shall we try a second-circle ward?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2FmYjNkNDk0ZjQ1YmRhZDY2YjVlZmM5ZTczYzgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine!” Serena gave the command as Amelia set up the next level of magic.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhNGExYzI2MTk0ZDQwZDRiZjU0YzU4OTk2N2QxYjk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMyYjUxZTFmMTQyYjQ3ZjhiZDgwNjNhMjQ1OWVjMjQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, with only a few hours until they landed at Asamaywa, Amelia was dragged away from her game of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Drunk Demon’s Hand</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> where she’d won a significant chunk of Dagon’s monthly pay and was led by Serena out and onto the deck of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzdjNmMyYzBkNTQzODQ5MTYwNWY1YzEyYjFhNzJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow!” Amelia exclaimed, stepping out into the open air and pointing towards the front of the ship. “You can see the airflow!” Like the aircraft from her world, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> had flaperons. The large panels that extended off the port and starboard side of the ship's hull could be adjusted from the bridge to affect the ship’s roll and help generate lift. An opaque air stream erupted from their tips, trailing the ship's length.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTBjZDg4Y2UzNjRlNmY4ZjUwZTlkYWFhY2YwMmE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s called trailing vortices,” Serena explained. “Happens due to differences in pressure along the flaperon. Atmospheric conditions around the Nai inlet and its mountains are ripe for it when we’re at full sail.” She gestured, and Amelia saw the enormous port and starboard sails fully deployed and catching the westerly winds. Good winds could reduce fuel usage by as much as a third, and most vessels took advantage of this fact as much as possible.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODdiMWFhYzVmZDQwMjliNTNmNzE4MjEyOGVkMTQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here,” Serena said, leading Amelia to the railing and pointing down. “That’s Nai.” Far below was a plateau city tucked into the end of an inlet. “They were the last kingdom in the East to fall during the Long Discordancy and the first to re-establish themselves. See how their position is uniquely defensive?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTU4ZmRhNDc1NTRjMWQ4ZGQ0ZTlkOTExNDc5MDQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded. Mountains hugged Nai on three sides and only a thin path a few kilometres wide was passable between the mountains and each edge of the inlet. On the eastern side, this gap narrowed into nothing as the mountains reached the continent's edge and on the western side the passage opened up to the vast expanse of the wilderness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2RlYzRlYTI4YzQ2Y2ZhYzgyOGJkNzFmMzg4Nzg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only one chokepoint to defend, right?” Amelia asked. At the end of the western passage, a large wall separated the territory of Nai and the wilderness beyond. Of all the plateau cities she had seen so far, Nai looked like it had cleared the wilderness further from itself than any other, although the total area was likely less than Kenhoro’s surroundings. “Hey,” Amelia continued, pointing down. “You can see earthworks where each previous line of defence was.” It looked like Nai expanded its territory in no fewer than a dozen separate offensives throughout the centuries.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmFmZjZiMTk3MjRjYmVhMzRjMzI2M2NhMTg3NzY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve got good eyes,” Serena said approvingly. “Each Terra Firma’s Overlord closely controls territory expansion. If we take too much too quickly, it’ll trigger a reaction and the ensuing monster wave could wipe out a city.” Amelia nodded. She found it incredible how this sprawling Empire was forced to coexist with this great wilderness and its dinosaur-like inhabitants.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjM3YWZkMTI0ZTQyOTlhZmI2OTNlZGU3YWQ0OWMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She glanced over Nai and its surrounding towns. Dozens and dozens of small fishing vessels were sailing from one side of the inlet to another; nets spread wide. In a manner similar to waterborne fish in her old world, the continent edge was where the majority of airborne fish life was found in this realm. “Looks like living here would be cosy!” Amelia called out happily. Nai reminded her of a quaint seaside town.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmQzYmQ5MzM1ZjRlYjY5NWUxYmZjNzM0MTk4NTgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a popular holiday destination for the citizens of the Three Sisters,” Serena replied. “Nai is Nina’s favourite city. House Halen owns a small estate in one of the towns. It should be…” Serena's eyes narrowed as she searched the land below. A moment later her brow furrowed and a frown appeared.. “...I’ve forgotten,” she eventually mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzVhOGQxOTMyMTQzMzI5MTQzYzE3MWQwYTc3NmZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Must be so nice to be so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">rich</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you can forget about all these extra homes you own!” Amelia grinned and began strutting about the deck in her best impression of a stuck-up noble. “Why yes, Sir Chesterfield! The theatre was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">most</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">- oops!” Amelia pretended to trip over something. “Oh my! What was that!? It appears to be yet </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">another</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> estate I own. They seem to pop up </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">everywhere</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> these days!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODU0ZDdhMTU3MDRlZDQ4ZGZiNWZmODVkZDM5MjI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena rolled her eyes and placed a hand on her belt-holstered pistol. “You trying to get shot again, idiot?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjczZDc0YWFjZjQzNTU4YTY0MDdiMjdiZjU4ZjAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Always,” Amelia fired back with a smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGFkNmE0ODBjMDRkZmFiNTYxMjRkMDBmYjA0ZDY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t forget, you’re soon going to be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so rich</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you can begin buying multiple homes across the East,” Serena explained pointedly. That morning, Amelia signed an updated contract. Some of the provisions of the previous contract revolving around Amelia needing to use her healing powers on Serena’s orders were possibly illegal now she was a Lord-Prospect. Nevertheless, a new contract was signed where Amelia was simply an advisor to Serena - now </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Halen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> - and her monthly pay doubled to two thousand four hundred denarii! It was an enormous sum, equivalent to three hundred soldiers!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2IwMjUyZTRiMzQ3MzhiNWQ5ODYyNGExM2I2MmM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, House Halen was handling her funds until all the official paperwork for bank accounts for House Thornheart could be processed. House Thornheart! Amelia was the newly minted head of her very own noble house! In the near future, she’d even get to create her very own sigil and have her insignias crafted! Amelia wasn’t sure what her sigil would look like, so she needed to find time to go over records of other houses for inspiration.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmNhZmY5ZmVhNjQxNTM4ZGVmNjBiYTU5ZTM5ZWVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Three Sisters will come into view soon,” Serena said, pointing to the horizon. The Three Sisters; the cities of Asamoto, Asamaywa, and Asamino were where Serena grew up, with Asamaywa being home to House Halen’s core estate and the academy they would soon be attending as instructor and teaching assistant. They would stay at the estate where Serena’s mother resided. Judging by Serena's expression when talking about the woman, it seemed she would be much less accepting of their relationship than the soft-hearted father!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTEzNDAwOWI4MTQwOTliZjQ1MzBjZjMzYjRkNjhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well! Amelia would simply have to kill the woman with kindness! If she saw how powerful she was, surely the demon mother would come to understand how safe and protected her eldest daughter was with Amelia’s wards!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWQ2ZWI1ZDdlMzRjMWRiMjRlOGQ4ZDhlZDBmNDUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGZiYjlkNmVlOTQxODQ4ZDY0YTVkZDk0NTE0MjU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, a small ball of anxiety refused to go away, and Amelia was glad to be distracted by the beautiful sights offered by the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> deck. “What’s that?” she asked, pointing towards an area outside Nai where some kind of worksite was established against one of the mountains. “A mine?” Rail was laid into tunnels, and Amelia’s sharp eyes could see they were bringing out minecarts filled with rock.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTQ1ZTRlZWNlYTQzZTNhZWYzYzg1YjMwYjc2Zjk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, not quite. They’re building train tracks through the mountain. Soon, Nai will become connected by rail to the Three Sisters. With the help of mages, they’ve been blasting their way through the mountain range for more than ten years now. I think they’re on target to finish next year.” Serena had a look of pride on her face, clenching her fist. “Once it’s done, it’ll be one of the greatest achievements in the East! To tame even the mountains themselves!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzMxYWI1YWU1NzQ2OWJiOGY4Y2Q3NWEwMzQ1N2Y3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia hummed happily. “Do you think I should help? I could-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGJkZWIwZTc0ZDQwMDA5NjMxZDAyY2EwMTMxNTdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot,” Serena interrupted, reaching out and ruffling Amelia’s hair. “Let us have our achievements! Knowing you, you’ll level half the mountain range and walk away whistling!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2Q0ZWU5Mzk0NzRjNDFhNTcyZjJlZmI1MjMxMDJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe…” Amelia smiled, retying her hair. As she tried to think of a comeback, she spotted another point of interest. On the outskirts of one of Nai’s towns was a series of great stone pillars formed in concentric circles from which long columns of pillars stretched to the east and west. The construction seemed important as the nearby towns avoided building near them. “What’s that?” Amelia asked, directing Serena’s attention to the mystery.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDgyOGQyODAwNTQ3NTRiODJjNjlkNGM5NTE0YmFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s the Needles of Nai! Guess who put up all those stone pillars?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGY3ODIzZmNjODRiODQ4YjkzNjEyOTdhYWQxOTFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, the Empress?” Amelia guessed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzRiZTUxYTJhYTRhYmE5NGQ1ZjU5YzczYWJmOTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No one knows!” Serena declared with a sly smile. “They’re old. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Really</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> old. I’m not exactly sure how the archaeologists know but apparently it was built </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thousands</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of years before even the first human caravans arrived in this realm! They could be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">five thousand</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> years old! Imagine what they’ve seen. To those stones, the Empire itself must seem young! See those two columns extruding from the main circles?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDU2YTYwNmRiNjQxZmI4YzE5YzAzNWM0NWVhYzFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjliNWFjOWE4ZDQ1ZDg5ZTI4NTVjMjc0OGFhMGFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They align </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">perfectly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> with the summer and winter solstice. Whatever ancient demon civilisation built them, it must have been a grand undertaking.” Serena cast a glance at Amelia. “Why did they build them? What gods were they worshipping? Was it a site of religious pilgrimage… or something else? Very mysterious, aye?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGQzY2E1YTlmNjRhYmZiMTI1YzZmMTEzMTBlNjVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mmm! It was tremendously mysterious! Amelia quickly filed the Needles of Nai away as yet another tourist destination she would visit! The pair made small talk as the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> crossed over the Nai inlet into the mountains. Not long after, the Three Sisters came into view.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDdkMzBkZWE2MzRhOTU4YTA0ZTk3N2U4Y2M3N2Vm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight was breathtaking! Across the eastern edge of the mountain range, the urban centre presented a great conglomeration that was perhaps ten times larger than Kenhoro! Amelia could make out the three distinct built-up areas that were the plateau cities of Asamoto to the north, Asamaywa below it, and Asamino below that. However, these cities had long been joined into one huge metropolis with buildings and towns sprawling out not just on the ground floor but throughout the mountain range!</span></p><span class="cjliZGQxMDM5NDNmZDQyNDlhMGM4NjFkNjZhMDU5YjYw"><br/>The narrative has been taken without permission. Report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmNGMwOGIyMTAwMzQ1ZjViOWQxOWY2YTc5OTlmNDhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There seemed to be a never-ending stream of ships docking and leaving. Dozens of plateau lifts moved people and cargo to and from the ground while it was all interconnected by an extensive web of tramlines and rail. Even from this distance, Amelia could see so much </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">movement</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> constantly going on. Grand buildings, larger and more impressive than anything she had seen in Kenhoro were littered about. The architectural style of the Three Sisters was similar to Kenhoro, with tiled gable roofs, although there seemed to be a much greater usage of stone than wood.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmQ4ODQ1MGJmOTQyNDA4ZjE4NjVmYmZjOWE1MGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned to Serena and saw her girlfriend looking at the distant metropolis with a gentle smile. The last time Serena was at the Three Sisters was over a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTE3OGM5ZjI3OTQ3YjBhMWU3YzUyMDQ3M2M2Mjk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome home!” Amelia chirped. “How does it feel?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmYzMmYzNGM0MDRmN2NhM2Q4OGUxNzAyODFhM2E2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good,” Serena said. “But also, an unusual feeling of… tension. It’s strange.” Serena shook her head, and with one last look at the horizon, walked away from the railing. “Come on, let’s get ready.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2U1OGU0ZTkxNzQ0ZGY5NmQ1ODFmODU0ZmI3ZGE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They made their way through the ship towards the captain’s quarters. On the way, any sailor they passed would offer a quick salute to Serena. Interestingly, many of them also nodded towards Amelia. Her recent ascension into Cascadian nobility had caused a notable change in how she was treated on the ship, and everyone seemed to treat her less casually and talk to her in a more respectful tone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MThkNjc4M2RkODRmMjQ4MDY4MmQ2MzYxOTQ1MjFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Except for the ship’s Head Cook, who seemingly would have ordered the Empress herself to do the washing up should she ever have dinner on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Last evening, Amelia’s protests were ignored and she’d somehow been corralled into another short shift in the kitchens. “Once a chef, always a chef!” had been the rallying cry that had shut down her complaints. Still, it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> nice to feel part of the team, working towards the common goal of feeding the hundreds of sailors aboard the ship.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDU3ZjI0OTMxNDRlOWQ4ZmIxMTg3YWM4YjA4Zjc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Something you should know,” Serena said once they’d returned to the familiar captain’s quarters. Serena shut the door and sat at her desk. “The Three Sisters has almost no human population. There are no human districts like in Kenhoro. You’re probably going to be stared at. A lot.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjFkMjY1NmFiMDRiNWViNzk0YmZhNWFlMmNhZTlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can handle being stared at.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2ZkZWZkZTIwMzQ1YjNiMTZjZDA1MTllM2ZjZjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. Of course…” Serena nodded, twiddling her thumbs. “I just want to prepare you. It’s not so much </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">discrimination</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you’ll face as much as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">curiosity.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Not many humans pass through the Three Sisters; most human travel in the East only goes as far as the cities on the northern edge: Kenhoro, Tanhae and Nachon. That travel will mostly be natives of the Sabanis Dominance and sometimes the Federation. Chances are you’ll be the first blond-haired human a lot of the public have seen outside of photographs. Some areas outside the city might have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">never </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">seen a human in person.” Serena shrugged. “It’s going to be different from Kenhoro.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWJkYmY2MWM4MzRmNTQ5MWNiNWE5ZWMyZTdkZmE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose my lovely eyes will only add to the spectacle of my arrival?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2I1MGY3ZGM4ZDQxNWJiYzkwYWFiMDhlOGZlOWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!” Serena leaned back in her chair. “That’s one way of putting it. Yet, it’s not the general public I’m most concerned about. Experiencing your capabilities is very different from only hearing about it from rumours which have no doubt spread all over the Three Sisters. You’re </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">young,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and some might outright deny you’re a Speaker. You’re </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, and some might disregard your new-found nobility. Just… don’t expect to make friends with everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjRiNGRmYzI4ZjRiZTk4NzQ5ZjkxYjU5Mjg4Y2Iw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded. “Alright, I’ll keep my expectations low.” It was perfectly understandable and Amelia didn’t carry any assumptions that anyone would automatically accept her. At least, not until they witnessed how cute and powerful she was.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDI1YzIwODFjMTRmZWViZGIzOGYxOTU0NmNjNmRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And finally…” Serena took a breath. “There’s my mother. She’s a bit…” Serena held out her palm, turning it this way and that. “Not exactly a lover of humans. It’ll take more than one meeting before she warms up to you. I received communications from our estate earlier this morning. She’s expecting us for dinner. So, just…” Serena sighed. “Expect some awkwardness.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODc0NjgyMTlmZjQwMGRhNDNjYmRiNmM1NDAzMDFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, this hadn’t helped with her anxiety one bit!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTQ1ODQzYmU2MjRkMzJiMWFiMzc0Y2ZhNGZjZDBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now I’m dreading it,” Amelia said, prompting a sympathetic smile from Serena. “Still, it’s just us and her, right? Nina is still working in Centralis.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjlhNmY1ZjJiYjQ5OWFhNmEyMjQxZmU1NjEzMzk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Serena nodded. “We can manage it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjgzNDVmMWNhZTRkYzY5MDI3NDk5ODIyNjVmZjY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… Captain,” Anathor piped up from the mounted moose head on the wall. “Communication just came into the bridge. You might want to hear this.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGNmYmE3ODQxMTRhMWU4ODhhNTM5NGYzZDhhNGNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell me, Anathor.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Njc3MzA5NmQzYzQyMGJiMzUxYTY4ZjNhNzg5OGRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… it’s your mother. She communicates her delight at seeing her eldest daughter after so long. She looks forward to having you and Lord-Prospect Thornheart over for dinner this evening alongside Greatlord Oshiro and his wife.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGQ0ZjYxYWRlNjRiYTViM2E5NTRmYTUwMzE3NmMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” Serena bent over the desk, head in her hands. Those hands moved upwards and firmly grasped her horns. “Fuck.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzdiMGRkNjgzZTRlOGVhZWFjMDA4NzA0MWRlNmRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YjM2ZGIyMzViNDQ1NmY4Y2U1ZGVmMzE2ZTNlMGRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMxYzg1MzVkOGZlMTRjOGI4NzhiZTNhMWFlMTc2ZTFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem anxious,” Tomes said, peering through his spectacles from his desk. The quartermaster was doing paperwork, scratching away at the paper. Amelia couldn’t help but pace back and forth, stopping only to practice her curtsy in front of the room’s mirror. After Serena left to oversee the docking process, Amelia couldn't bear to sit around and had come to Tome's quarters to distract herself. Not long after, they had been joined by Dagon, who had just been relieved by Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTQ5MThkMTE3YjQzYjU5NjliNWE5MmIxMjRkN2Yw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s got a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> important dinner coming up,” Dagon intoned from the room’s sofa. The First Officer sat reclined, picking his teeth with a toothpick. “Heard it from the Cap’n. Guess who it’s with, Tomes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGM4N2ZkNjQyNzRkY2FiMmMwMjM5MTIyYzg3NzE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Tomes looked thoughtful. “Given that we’re coming into dock in Asamaywa, the wonderful home of our famous Captain…” the quartermaster tilted his head with pity. “It was nice knowing you, Miss Thornheart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTRjMGIyZjRmMzQ2MWY4YmY1YjU1N2QzM2M4NGU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-she can’t be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> bad!” Amelia cried, exasperated. Her knot of anxiety had grown into a monstrous ball. “Serena’s father was nice enough! And her sister! Why’s everyone looking at me like I’m going to be eaten!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWNlOTE1YWRkMjRjY2FiZmRjYzhjNTcxOWQxMTRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They call her the Devil of the East,” Dagon said, moving his fingers to dance the toothpick across his hand and back. “Aint that right, Tomes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTkwM2I4MjQ2MTRlODRhNzI3NzI5OTliNTllYjU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right you are, Dagon.” Tomes looked at Amelia with a solemn expression. “Men stutter for a week after receiving one of her verbal lashings - isn’t that right, Dagon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWI0NjU2YzdhZjRkNDZhNTNiZGE2YmFkYzZmZTM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn right.” Dagon flicked the toothpick into the bin. “One small slip of etiquette, you’ll be chewed out and what remains served for supper. Ain’t that the way things are, Tomes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDYxNjQ3MWM3YTQwNTE5ZmUzMjRhN2JhYTRmMDMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Spot on,” Tomes replied. “Remember that pretty little noble she dressed down at that ball? It’s been a year and she hasn’t left her estate has she, Dagon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGViNjQwNWZjMjQwYTZhOGViYjhjYjI0M2VjZTg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh!</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDhhNmRiMDZiNjQ4NGI5N2FjZjljMTczZTkxNDY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel sick,” Amelia groaned. “Tomes, is this curtsy okay?” She performed her best curtsy, utilising every bit of enhanced dexterity her new body afforded her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjFjZjZlYjQ4MTQ0YWNiMDM1MzU0MTZlYTU1Yzk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Tomes adjusted his glasses. “Seems passable. The real test will be the dinner. Isn’t that right, Dagon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2QzM2E4NTc5ZTQyNTM5YTA5YWMzMjQxY2Q0MzAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dagon nodded. “The Devil of the East is known to keep a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">particularly </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">fine table. Hopefully, Miss Thornheart here remembers how to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">carve</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Nzc2M2VjYTRhMjQ3ZjM4MGI4ZTQwNzliMjEyZWMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“C-carve!?” She didn’t know how to carve! “Surely I won’t be expected to!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjM2OWJiMmYwZjQ4YzY5NDIzZDUzYWQzYTY1YjE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen,” Tomes said, leaning forward with one hand extended in the mock action of a carving knife. “Carve </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">away</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the bone.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTczMDAwNTQxMTRmN2U4ZDVkNzM4NGYyNGM2NTNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Away from the bone. Right!” Amelia nodded intensely.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTJmOGUwNjI0NjRjMWM5OThiMjQ4ZTQyMjkxOTBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it’s venison, cut it in thick slices. If it’s mutton, medium. Beef, thin.” Tomes motioned the sizes with a finger and forefinger, and Amelia tried to burn them into memory. “Oh, and if they serve </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">choco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, try not to saw at it. Long, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">smooth</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> motions.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2ViYzUzZjkxOTQxYzY5ZWY2YTg1YjBkNTMzMmQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Away from the bone, away from the bone. Venison thick. Mutton medium. Beef thin.” Amelia chanted the knowledge to herself with one finger on each temple.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWMzNGUyYTE3NjQ1YjA5Y2Y2ZTdhNWY4NjMyY2Rl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye,” Dagon said. “But be careful, they might go super fancy and serve </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmNlN2M3ZDQ1YTQ1N2NiYWQ3N2ZhYTVlOTQ5NDdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Human? What do I do then!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmJhYTJmMTM4NTQzNmM5ZjA2ZjI4YWM4NzQ4ODhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Human? You take the knife and sort of…” Dagon took a hand and mocked a mincing motion against the sofa cushion. “Mince. Quite thoroughly.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjRkYTlmYTY1MzRjMmI5YzE4M2U5MTlhNzk4ZDg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, right,” Amelia muttered. “Venison thick. Mutton medium. Beef thin. Human mince.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWJlYjMwYjBkNTQ4MmU5N2UwNDhlNzlkOTRhODdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dagon sniggered, and then he and Tomes burst out in laughter. The sudden change in atmosphere knocked Amelia’s mind into gear.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODJhYmE2Yzg1YzRiZDc4YTI0NjQ3NDU1MGQxNmNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">These… these idiot demons!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmJmZDY1NTVhYTQyN2VhOWY4ZDBkOTQ0YmMyNjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia scrunched up a piece of paper and threw it at Dagon, who headed the projectile across the room towards Tomes, who slapped it straight into the bin. If Amelia weren’t so annoyed, she would compliment them on their demonstration of teamwork!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzBiMTBkYTlkZDRjN2E5N2UwMWE3YjQ4YTc0N2I3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">funny</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Amelia sarcastically intoned, folding her arms. “This is your revenge against me winning your wages, huh!?” In response, Dagon chuckled, reclining and flashing Amelia his chunky white teeth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Nzc0NzZlZGVkZjQ3MjhhNGVkYzFiNjkwNTZjNTAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ll be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fine</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Tomes said with a smile. “You don’t become such a well-known figure in eastern social circles as the Lady of House Halen without having </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">tact</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. You’re a Lord-Prospect </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">a Speaker. She might prod a bit, but she won’t cross the line, even if she doesn’t like you.” He shrugged. “Besides, the Captain will be there; she’ll bail you out.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2ZkNGQzOWY2ODQ2ZGFiNWY1MjMwODUwNjgzMWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, she’s gonna be too busy clutching her horns, Tomes.” Dagon piped up. “Greatlord </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Oshiro</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and his wife are going to be attending.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2MwMDZhMTFhZTRjMzA4OTQzMDg1YTU0MDRmNzdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh dear,” Tomes mumbled. “At that point, you might as well invite the Dragon and be done with it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWM5OTdmMTA0YTQ3ZGJiOTJkY2U4NmNkNDY1Mjg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> helpful,” Amelia complained. She was going to complain further but was stopped by the ship rocking slightly and the structure creaking. The ever-subtle hum of the ship’s lift engine whirled down.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2YxNWIyYWNmODRlYTJiYzg3YjcwZDUyZTQzMDQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There it is,” Tomes said. “We just docked.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2ZjY2I3MDJlMTQwYjVhNmRlYWYxZTRmNjliNmJm" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">They had arrived in Asamaywa.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwMmZlMmI3NjQ0YjQ2ZDM4NTFmZTVkNzg0NWEzNWFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWM5ZDJmNWE4ZjQ2Mzk4ZjhiMWY2Yzk5YWVjZTRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena hadn’t been wrong.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTZmZmUzMWRlNzQwMjJhNjJkN2Q2NzM4OTliMjg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment Amelia crossed the gangway and set foot on the Asamaywa Imperial Airdocks, several dozen workers ceased their activities and stared at her, stopping only to elbow their coworkers and nod in her direction. Unlike her arrival in Kenhoro, Amelia wasn’t wearing a hat and so her blond hair was as noticeable as a lighthouse aetherlight. Serena suggested Amelia travel covertly throughout the city, but she’d rejected the idea; she was now a Lord-Prospect, and if she wanted to integrate fully into demon society, then the sight of her was something they would need to get used to!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGVmNWRlMmZlYzQ0ZTg5OWY4ZTgwN2E3MDY1Nzli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Team leaders barked at the distracted workers who scrambled to resume their duties. Still, other demons kept their attention on her; small groups of people dressed in naval officer uniforms mumbled amongst themselves, throwing the occasional glance. Doing her best to ignore them, Amelia chose to look up and down the airdocks, marvelling at how different it was from Kenhoro. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlODY0OTM4YjczNzRmMjBhYjZkYWFhOTQ4NDJiOThj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The airdocks stretched the entire length of the eastern side of Asamaywa and its connecting sister cities of Asamoto and Asamino. Hundreds of bays were frantic with activity; the noise of engineers with their steam grinders and welders produced a symphony of industry. Dozens of cranes loaded and unloaded cargo, moving large wooden crates and nets filled with sacks. The standardised shipping container that was so recognisable in Amelia’s old world didn’t seem to have been invented yet, so she made a mental note to bring it up with Serena at some point.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmQ5NzVhYThlZjQ4NmFiMmZhMmU4MjA4MmVhZDNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hum of dozens of ship engines filled the air, and it was here Amelia saw a battleship for the first time. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was classified as a light cruiser at approximately eighty meters long, but the ship before her was more than double that, with an enormous superstructure extending above its deck and below its underhull. Massive triple-barrelled turrets lined the main deck, making the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> armament resemble a toy. Amelia counted a dozen secondary turrets, which looked roughly the same size as the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> four-inch main batteries. All in all, the ship looked like an angry steel porcupine. This wasn’t a ship that danced with the enemy, nimbly positioning itself and dodging fire. This ship chose a spot in the air, parked itself there, and then obliterated anything rude enough to think it was allowed in the same part of the sky.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2UwMGZlMWE5MDQ1M2NiOGEwYTUzMjE2MGJiNGZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Oshiro-class</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the latest design in the East’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ship-of-the-wall</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> doctrine,” Serena said, looking at the same ship Amelia was. “Named after the Greatlord of Asamaywa and my direct superior.” Serena paused for a moment, fiddling with her gloves. “At least, he </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> my direct superior. I guess the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">’s</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">lease has ended, and we’re back in the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">capable</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> hands of Centralis Intelligence.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmNkNmFlMDcyZjRjMDdhYjYyMTIzMjI0OTVlMjJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The same Oshiro we’re about to be dining with…” Amelia mused, trying not to smile at the recent memory of Serena clutching her horns. “He must be impressive to have a line of battleships named after him.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzI5M2QwOGQ1ODQxNDZhOGI4ODUwMGEwMDNhMGRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Oshiro to you, and to me, and to anyone who doesn’t want to embarrass themselves. You’re nobility now, so take extra care to remember the titles of your fellow nobles. Now…” Serena sniffed, looking back at the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> deck. “Tomes! Where’s my First Officer?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGRhZjZjODFmOTQzMjNhMTU1OTY0YjdkN2IwM2Q2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Coming now, Cap’n!” Tomes called back. Dagon appeared, hurrying down the gangway and giving Serena a quick salute.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTQ3OTA4YzljNDQ5ZWVhODJjMzIyYTU3MDhiNDMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain,” Dagon intoned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWU2MDYwZmZlMDQyNTFiNDc4Nzk5Y2EzNzZhNjBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dagon, what are your current duties?” Serena asked, a subtle smile forming on her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDE5NTZkNTZkMDQ4MzQ4NjU1M2RkODk0NWI0Mzdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well....” Dagon rubbed the back of his head. “Given that you and Miss Thornheart are off to dinner, I’ll sort out the paperwork with the Dockmaster. Then-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDA5N2ZhMTRjMzRlNzE5ZWYyOTcwZGNkZjNkOTdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wrong answer. Get Tomes to do it. You’re coming to dinner with us.” Serena clicked her tongue, turning and gazing at the battleship a few bays down. “I’m outgunned at this dinner. Dealing with my mother </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the Greatlord </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> his wife? You’ve been a fine First Officer, haven’t you? It would be an honour for you to dine alongside a Greatlord in a Highlord’s estate, would it not?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzgxZTNhN2UzZTRiZTk4ZWI0ZDhmY2E0ZjRhOGI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dagon breathed out slowly, and Amelia heard a stifled laugh from the quartermaster on deck. Dagon looked like he’d much rather be facing the barrel of a gun than Serena’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">honourable</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> gift. “It… would be a great honour, Captain,” a deflated Dagon mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTA3MmZhNTFhNjQ3N2M4NWQyM2FkM2UyY2I3ZGRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent,” Serena beamed a charismatic smile. “Go find out if we have a carriage waiting for us. If not, procure one. Dismissed.” Dagon responded with a salute slightly slower than normal and trundled off. Serena folded her arms and looked around with her usual impeccable posture.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2FlYTU2ZWQxNDQ5MDZiYjExNjQ0ZmY4NjBiNzE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that allowed?” Amelia asked. “To just invite him like that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWE2NWVjZDZhOTRlMGVhODNmZTc1MzMzZTRkNmZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lords are permitted to bring a guest to most events. It’s an important tradition that allows nobles to create connections between their benefactors and others. It’s a ‘you scratch my horn and I scratch yours’ kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODNkMzI3N2Q5MDRkNjE5NDQ1NDUzNDMzODVjYjA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, would I be permitted to bring a guest?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDQxY2Q5NGZkNDRmNTU5NjdjYmIxOGUzZWZlOGI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena looked at her suspiciously. “Yes. However… you have a mischievous twinkle in your eye. Who are you thinking of?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTc4OTkxYThkYzRkNTdhODdlNmIxMDE4N2Y5ZmU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Grinning, Amelia turned and called up to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> deck. “Oi, Tomes!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmIwNTcwZWZlNjRlMTI4NWI2ZDMwNTE2MzhmYTJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!” came the reply.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDI5MDg5OTBhMTQ1ZjdhMDBiOWFiOTNlNzgyYjZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Want to have dinner!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjUwOTFiOTE4ZDRkNjZhOGIyMDk4MGY5MTA1MzZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Piss off!” A moment of silence passed and then Tomes appeared with an apologetic look on his face. “Uh, no offence, Captain. I just meant… you know…” he said with a sheepish smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmIzZjQ4MjU4ZjRlMDBhMjZjNWE3ZTA2YWY3YTMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What was that, Tomes!?” Serena yelled. “Did I just hear you volunteer to clean the toilets?” Serena gave Tomes a hard stare until the quartermaster acknowledged the order with a meek “Yes, Captain” and disappeared off out of sight.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTgzMzkwOTcwZDQ0YWE4ZmE5NjUxNjNlOWU4ZmUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">too</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> casual with them in public,” Serena mumbled. “At least, not at first. There will be a lot of opposition against your appointment to Lord-Prospect. If you veer too much from established norms, it will be seen as a mockery of high society from a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzAwMTUzZDA1NjQ0NTNhMzlkYWY4MmYyNjczNmE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded. It was a point Serena had been driving home recently. While the Overlords and their subordinate Greatlords no doubt knew about her Speaking the Second Word, her capabilities were less well-known to most of high society. Even the idea that someone as young as she was a Speaker of the First Word was challenging to believe.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTRjM2M1NzA2MDQ1MzE5MDdkYjk2MTZlM2IwNDQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dagon appeared with a worried look on his face. “Captain,” he said as he arrived with a salute. “There’s a carriage waiting for you, I mean us, outside the docks. The problem is…” he glanced back over his shoulder. “The hacks are there, swarming.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDAyOWYzYTA2OTQyNjBhNTRmYjMwNTQzYTgyNWE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk!” Serena clicked her tongue and swore.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2I0YzU0ZGJiZDRiNDdhNmY4Y2Y4OGU2MTRmY2Q4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hacks?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWVhNWJiMGNmMDRiOTM4ZWE5NzM1YTZhYWJiOWI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reporters,” Dagon explained. “Poking their horns in Captain’s business. They’ve got cameras and everything. I imagine they’re here for you, Miss Thornheart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGNjMzAzNDNmYTRhYzFhZTliOWZjN2UzNTViOGZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thornheart, in public Dagon.” Serena hissed. “Seven hells!” She turned to Amelia. “Don’t answer any questions, and stick by me. How far to the carriage, Dagon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTM3ZmIzZWE4OTQ4NzU5NGYzNWE5NjcwYTcyZjcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ten meters. The driver got it as close as he could. They recognised your sigil. More are arriving every minute, so the quicker we go, the easier it’ll be.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDIyNjdlM2I5NzRmOWJiNzNkODY2NjY2ZmQ5ZmEy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No time to waste then,” Serena turned and caught the attention of a handful of sailors. “You lot, help us get through this pack of hacks. Don’t let them get too close.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDEwZGMxNjhmMjQxYjNhMzMzMTllYWRkOTY3MjIy" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YTRmOWFkY2EyMTRlYjQ5YTI0NjA1MzU2MmYzMDYw" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye, Captain!” came the chorus of replies. The sailors rolled up their sleeves and rolled their shoulders. They looked more like they were preparing for a pub fight than anything else. A tinge of nervousness formed in Amelia’s stomach. Reporters from her world were generally highly professional, and the profession was respected. How bad would they be here? How far would a journalist go to get a scoop?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzE1ODk5MDFhODQyZWQ5MTVmNTI4MDRiMDBkZTA5" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxM2VmNTAwNTVkZjQ2YTBhMTcwYWVkOGIyZTk5NGRi" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go,” Serena commanded, and the group moved to leave the docks. Serena went first, then Amelia, and finally Dagon, protecting the rear. The sailors took the flanks. The moment they turned the corner towards the exit the rabble became apparent. Dozens of demons were pushing against a line of dock guards, each holding either a notebook or an old-fashioned-looking camera.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDhmMTBkMmEyMTQ2MzI5MzYzN2RjOWY1MzZhNTI0" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNTMzYmQ3ODcxYTRjZTViZjdjZTU0ZWVmOWI2OTVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Or at least, old-fashioned according to Amelia. Where the novelty cameras from her old world had an electric bulb for their flash photography, the ones in this world used a moon crystal to generate a burst of light. Unfortunately, she didn’t have much time to examine the fascinating piece of magical technology. Still, as the cameras were raised and the flashes began, she noticed with each flash the camera would give off a little hiss of steam. She felt like she was walking into a den of snakes. The thought made her giggle, which helped a bit with the nervousness.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjQ5OGQ5ZTk4ZjQ3Nzc5NzY2ZGFiYTc1OGE1YjAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The guards parted and their group began pushing through the journalists. Serena barked at them to make way, flaring her aura so it was as visible as possible. While her presence was enough to slowly part the preying journalists, the sailors protecting Amelia’s sides did not have their personal space respected as much. Cameras were raised high and pushed between gaps in their defences, flashing and hissing steam. Thank god Amelia wasn’t epileptic!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWZkNDMyYjI0ZDRhNGE5NWFiMmY0ZGVkNjEzYzIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t just the cameras. A hundred questions were thrown at her in a chaotic symphony of noise.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjU4MzcxZDk0MTRlNjlhYzA4ZmYzMGM5MzUxY2Zl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thornheart! Is it true you’re a Speaker!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTZlZGQzYjQ4YjQwY2Y5NDI2NTM0M2E3MjRjODBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Human! Lord Nakata has suggested you’re a spy! Do you have any comment on these accusations!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjI2OGE5OGY1YzQxMDc4MTdlZmI3NGM2OGUwYTFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it true you’re responsible for the downing of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakamoto!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzYzY2Y5NjA4ODQyNTVhNDEzMTgxMGY3NDg2YWM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord-Prospect! Sadow from the Eastern Herald! Comments on your alleged connection with the human Church and the Vatican!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzlmM2I1MGYzMTQ4OGFhOTNkMWUxMmI1OWY4Mzk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia could only smile and try to focus on the looming carriage ahead. The questions bombarded her, and once or twice, a journalist tried to grab her. Thankfully, the sailors had none of it, and a well-placed punch put the offender on the floor. The violence was a little disconcerting, but Amelia was made of stronger stuff! What were these journalists compared to her withstanding a direct burst of heavy flak or the relentless onslaught of Grandpa Gu?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2M5OTAzYzg5ZjRjMjZhZWExYzk0YTcyZjcyODJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They reached the carriage, Serena threw open the door and ushered Amelia in. Serena and Dagon followed, and the door was pulled shut. Serena banged on the roof and the driver wasted no time moving out. The crowd of journalists were forced to give way lest they be crushed under the horse's hooves. Not completely deterred, the journalists continued to chase and shout questions.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTM0YzZlODczNzRlNWRhMzVhNTJhNTk4N2YzOTQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">One particular question caught Amelia’s attention.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjA1YTMzMmExMDQ3MzliOWJhMWY3ODJlM2NiMDVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Human! What do you think of demons!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmZmNTVjODZhYTQ0YzA5YjVlYjAzZjkzZWVmMDdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The questions prompted a happy memory to surface. It was one of the first things she’d said to Serena when her girlfriend burst through the doors of the captain’s quarters, pointing a sword at her. Smiling at the memory, Amelia leaned out the carriage windows and locked eyes with the journalist who asked the question. With her warmest smile, she felt herself almost </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">glow</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> with friendliness. Pushing a little bit of aether into her voice, she answered the question with a wave.</span></p><span class="cmI3YmE0NzJiZjM0MDQ2MDY5ZmNmYmY1YjRjMTJhZmRm"><br/>This tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road. If you spot it on Amazon, please report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyMzgxZmFlMmYxMzQ5NWY5MjQ1NDAwOWMzNGUzMjlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">love</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> demons! I look forward to meeting everyone and doing my part!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDYyN2VkNjBiMTQwNjFhMTlhMWQwYTE2Mjc0MmJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words cut through the rabble, silencing them immediately. Only the hiss and flashes of a few cameras and murmurs could be heard.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmQ0YzlmNDA1NTQyNTQ5MDVmMGQ3NjQ1NDYxZWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you hear that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTFhNjdkMThiYjRiZWFhYzMzMzcxMmViNjM5MTg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She said she loves demons…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWZlNWRlZDhmMDQzZjY4ZjU2OTI5N2Q2ZjZhNzgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So pretty!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWZhYTdkYzFhNzQyY2VhMWMyNGQ5YzBhYzAxZmU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She was glowing!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWI3NzVhMTIwMzQyMjlhNjc0M2M2OTQ5MzY2NGYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The crowd soon recovered, and as the flashes picked back up and the questions began again, Amelia ducked back into the carriage. When she was back in her seat, Serena reached over and closed the curtains.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWZkNDdhNWU1ODRlNzhiNTI0NjQxOTJiODdmZDgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could have gone worse,” Serena mumbled. “I’ll petition Greatlord Oshiro to put a word in with the press tonight. It won’t stop all of them, but it’ll prevent you from being crowded when you step out onto the street.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWY3NGQxMWFhZjQ0MWQ4ZGI2YWUyYzM3ZjU4YjNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye, better get used to the attention, Miss Thornheart,” Dagon intoned. “You’ll be the public’s personage for the next few months.” He turned towards Serena. “I’ll have Tomes go over tactics regarding situations like these.” Serena nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTU1Y2NlMDFkODQwM2JhNDNlYjU5ZDczNGVkNzJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tactics?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGRkYzA2NjdiNTQ5MzNhZDg4YjZiNGM2MjMwOTdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When a nobility becomes the public’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">personage</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, or what you would call a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">notable</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena explained. Amelia thought about pointing out that the term in her world was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">celebrity</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> but decided to hold her tongue. “You need to find a balance between dignity, grace, and also </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">force</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Can’t show weakness to these kinds of people.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTA0YjkwZmI5YTRjZWY4MGYwZDU4NTEwNWQxMTEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You make it sound like they’re some kind of enemy,” Amelia pointed out.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTZhYjZkZjQ3ODRmYjA5N2NhZGUwYTE4YzBjNjgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They are, in a sense.” Serena sniffed. “Won’t be long now. The family estate is quite central.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjNkMGRkN2I2NTQ5ZGFhY2M4NTRkYTJmOWNkNDE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage continued along the busy streets and Amelia took some time to peek out the window. True to Serena’s word, she couldn’t see a single human amongst the pedestrians travelling throughout the city. Unlike Kenhoro, there seemed to be less of a variety of horns amongst the demon inhabitants. Most horns she saw were a single pair, curved upwards similar to - but nowhere near as pretty - as Serena’s. She also saw the men wore their hair in a high ponytail and that the city guards carried spears, not swords.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTJkZDdjZWEwMjRjNTc5OTAzZTgxNTk5ZGEzYzJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tenets and traditions of Sangoism,” Serena explained when Amelia mentioned her observations. “It’s the dominant religion in the Three Sisters and the one I grew up in until I found a better home as a Christian.” Her hand went momentarily to her chest, where Amelia knew her girlfriend sometimes wore a necklace with an upside-down cross, symbolising the demon church. Serena wasn’t extremely religious, but on occasion, Amelia had overheard her praying, something Serena didn’t like to be seen doing. Amelia suspected Serena saw praying as a weakness.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGM4YTQwNjM5NzRiY2RhYjQ5N2UxYzBmNTllOWNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did you believe when you were a… Sangoist?” Amelia asked, guessing at the correct terminology of a follower of Sangoism.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmY0YTkzZTU3ZTQwYThhNzA5NWI4MTA0NDg0NzE4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sangoist, yes,” Serena replied with a nod. “And I still believe. I simply found I was better able to serve the Empress as a Christian.” She took a breath. “Sangoism revolves around the teachings of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sango</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the founder of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sangoa</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the old city.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzAxNTVmMWQwYTRhMjc5NzdlNjk0NGY4MDgzNGIz" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhOWM3ODQ2ZWVjNDRjYzdhYWZlZDdlOTYwODU0ZWM2" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sangoa</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Where is it?” Amelia asked, not remembering the name from the maps of the East she had seen.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDg2YmViMDcxODRkM2FhOGY2MTUxZDA5MTUzYzgz" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZjVhNGRiZDEwYjQ4NWM5YWYyNjdjMTMxMzE5MGJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lost to the wilderness. The ruins should be out there somewhere, probably buried by now.” Amelia quickly filed the ruins of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sangoa</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> away as yet another mystery to be solved. “At thirteen, Sango fought a great battle and was victorious. He fought with a spear, which is why you see so much of the weapon around, and thirteen became the age boys become men in this part of the Empire.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmY3OTdiOTQ3YjQ1YjVhMzg2ZWQxODAwNjk0MDM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“At this age, they go through a ceremony called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taki Habbat</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, which translates as ‘The Rising of the Hair’ in High Imperial. As men, they are permitted to wear their hair up high, and should they ever shame themselves or their family, they must cut it in penance. If the crime is serious enough, the head will be shaved.” Amelia absorbed the information, not resisting a glance at Dagon who, like his battle-brother Tomes, was completely bald.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODJmOTMwYWE0NTRkODU5YzhlMjQ5YWIxOGVmNWEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t look at me like that,” Dagon said, rolling his eyes. “Me and Tomes are from </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurnal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Talik</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. All proper boys from there are bald from the moment they’re born.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmNlZmNmZDI1MjQxMTliNjVhZGE5OTRmNDE5MmE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And does their skin all have patterns like you two do?” Amelia asked. Dagon and Tomes had marbled skin boasting all kinds of blacks, greys, oranges and reds. Their pattern reminded Amelia of army camouflage, and she wondered if it was some kind of evolutionary adaption.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzljZmZlMTkxYzQzYWVhZDgyMTk5MDQzOWE4NDAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye, but the patterns vary,” Dagon responded, gesturing to himself with his thumb. “Tomes and I have the pattern of a warrior! You see, the red moon chose our fates when we were born. Strong patterns create strong men!” he finished with pride.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWI3MzBjMmM2NTQ1ZmRhYjFlZTMzNTdkMDVmNWYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about demons with no pattern?” Amelia asked, glancing momentarily at Serena. Her girlfriend was lightly toned, but along her spine were subtle stripes that Amelia enjoyed tracing with her finger. Secretly, Amelia liked to think of Serena as her little </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">tiger</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The iconic species had been extinct for a thousand years in her old world before it was resurrected through advanced technology.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTEzZWFkOGQ4MDQ4MjBhZjY3M2YzZjA1ZGY0M2U0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, well,” Dagon replied nervously, glancing at Serena. “The rules wouldn’t apply unless you were a member of desert society, of course…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzZmMTA1NTZjZTRkOTFhZTY3NDE5YTAxMmZhMDZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A lower caste,” Serena answered. “Good only as a common worker, isn’t that right, Dagon?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODMyZjVlYTRkOTRhNDE4MDdiY2Q3Y2ExMjUxNTE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not the way we think, Captain!” Dagon protested. “The old ways are dying out…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzY4NjI1MGFjNDRmYzFhY2FmNGEwOGQ0NzQ5YTYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did you and Tomes end up in the Eastern Navy?” Amelia asked, turning the conversation away from the awkward topic she had inadvertently stumbled upon.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTE2YTA4Y2YxNzQ4ODA5YmFhNjI5NTkwYWQyMDEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, well, Tomes was always the more studious of us, and in the Southern Navy promotion is centred more around how hard you can punch rather than how fitted you are for a position.” Dagon raised his hands, “Not that Tomes can’t throw a mean right hook, I just mean I realised he could do so much </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">more</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> outside the South.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzFiM2RhOGZjYzRlMWViZjg0OGNjMjJlOTEyMmYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew he wouldn’t make the decision himself, so I dragged him to Centralis and enlisted us both into the Imperial Navy. We got positions on a frigate and did a decent job, even if we had trouble fitting in. Like I said, Tomes is studious but knows how to throw a proper punch.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGUyYWI0MDEyZTQwMTZhM2E4MDYwNzI4NDY3MThm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Punches that threw themselves straight into a cell.” Serena interrupted with a smirk. “I was a squad commander then, under the previous Captain of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I found those two locked up in Ponan, awaiting a military trial. I saw their potential and the rest is history. You should have seen how hard it was to get him through the First Officer’s exam. I was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">this close,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Serena brought up her thumb and forefinger, “to bribing the examination board to let him pass.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzdkZmQ2NzdlZTQ4YTE4YjhiMjhlNzhmNjAxZDBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia laughed while Dagon weakly protested. The trio of them shared stories and chatted amicably and the time melted away as the carriage progressed through the city streets. Amelia had forgotten about her anxiety right up until they suddenly stopped, and they were hailed by someone outside the carriage.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWRlODllZTc3NTQ3ZTJiNTUzYzBlYWU1Mjc0OGJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re here?” Amelia asked, peeking outside the curtain but only seeing the edges of a huge iron gate.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzdlMGFmOGJhNjRkYzFhNjEwNGEyMDcwOGI3YWE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“At the front gate,” Serena answered before stepping outside and speaking to whoever had called out to them. A few moments passed and Serena reappeared. A loud </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">clunk</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> sounded and the iron gates opened with a whine. The carriage passed through and Amelia noticed an enormous silver wolf welded onto the gates. The familiar sigil of House Halen.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTllODdmYThlZTQzYjE5NmUzOTQ5ODVhMGE0Y2Rm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage trundled along the gravel pathway before veering in a semicircle around a fountain and pulling up to the front of the house.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTVhNWFhNzViMDQ2ODdiZjEwMGM1MDVkZGYxZDZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seven hells!” Serena muttered, peering through her window.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzAwMzA5ODRhZjQxZDc5NWRiMmY3MmU4MmZmNTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?” Amelia asked. “Your mother?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjAzYTViNTQwOTQyNTJiMmZiMTY5NTZhZmQ3ZTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Serena shook her head. “My </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">grandmother</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Mother must have sent her to fetch us, which means she’s probably already entertaining Greatlord Oshiro and his wife. Come on, let’s go.” Serena opened the door, stepping out of the carriage. Amelia followed with Dagon right behind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGFmMWMyNGJmNTQ3ODZiZDM4YTlhZWUwNDQ0ZTg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a single demon waiting for them. An elderly demon and probably the oldest looking demon Amelia had seen so far. The old woman was slightly hunched, wearing an elegant shawl and leaning against an ornately carved walking stick. Her face was weathered, but her eyes were bright crimson and when she looked at Amelia she seemed to bore right through her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGIwNGMxZWZiMjRiNTI4YTkxNDMxNWZhYTM0MDZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hurry your horns! Get over here!” Serena’s grandmother called out, her voice rough but clear and strong. “Seven hells! Now, let’s see… hmm…” The elderly demon mumbled as the trio fell in line before her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDYzZWVlOGJhMTQ3MmI5M2I5NThiODk1Njk5MzY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grandmother! How are you doing? I didn’t expect to see you today,” Serena said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTA0ZTM2N2IzYTQzY2FiY2Q3ZGU1ODA2MjhkMWE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph! Look at you! My granddaughter,” Serena’s grandmother peered closer, clicking her tongue in a very Serena-like fashion. “You look younger. A spitting image of your mother at your age. Is this the work of your human’s healing?” The elderly demon waved her walking stick in Amelia’s direction without looking her way.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWFkZGNiMTc0MTQzZjM5ZjhmZGFmNmRlNjhjMGI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grandmother, Amelia-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDZjZWU0NjJhYzQwYmQ5NjRhZWM1NWUyZGFhNzg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quiet! Your grandmother isn’t finished! I see your manners need some work.” The grandmother slowly circled Serena. Amelia focused on looking straight ahead with her very best posture lest she incur the wrath of this demon! “At least you’ve kept your uniform clean!” Amelia felt a small bubble of pride, knowing it was her cleaning magic that was responsible.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWMxYjg1NTk4ZjQwNzFhYTc1YWQ5NTBjNDEyYTNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see those idiots finally came to their senses and made you Lord. If young Oshiro was going to delay any longer, I was going to give him a whack!” To punctuate her point, the demon slapped the gravel a few times with her walking stick. “About time the Admiralty recognised you properly! Half of them are useless, and the other half spend most of their time picking up after the other idiots. It’s a wonder we haven’t lost the war with so many fools in charge!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTE0YjMyOWQxMjQ4NWFhYjkzNjI0YTJmNWNlMzBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grandmother!” Serena burst out with exasperation. “Please refer to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Oshiro with-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTlmNmNhNWVlMjQ3OWFiZjE0NjM3OGRmODVlOTYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? I give credit where it's due! Don’t think they scare me! I’m too old to get scared! Bah! I just spent the last hour telling it to his face! Although…” The old woman paused. “Maybe that’s why they sent me out instead…” she mumbled. No one said anything while the elderly demon finished her circle, standing back in front of the group. She narrowed her eyes at Dagon. “Who in the seven hells are you!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWY1ODQwMTU3ODRiYzdhZTZhODM2NDFhOWM2MmZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Dagon Dahlberg, Ma’am!” Dagon spluttered. “First Officer of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGU3ZjNiZGEwNjQ4MjJhOTQ5MmY5N2NlNzEyYWNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” The grandmother peered closely. A long silence ensued until she asked, “You’re from the South, aren’t you? Where do you hail from?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2Y3MTM2YmU1OTRhM2JiMWNhYTE0YzliNTRmYjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurnal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Ma’am.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODUwNGUzMmJkYTQ3NDNhNGUwNjBjNGRlODIxYWY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bah! Serena, is this man your lover?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTE3MmY3OWIwODRlNjliMGIzMDAwNGEyMzk2YjU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena spluttered. “Grandmother! Where are your manners!” Her voice betrayed a note of anger. Amelia turned her head to see Dagon going as red as a tomato. She couldn’t wait to tell Tomes about this in the future!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDExZjUwMTZiNzQxYmM4ZjcyMmM0ZTliNDEyYTQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t get snappy with me, missy!” A walking stick was waved in Serena’s direction. “You’re not married, and you’ve brought an upstanding-looking man with you! What am I supposed to think, eh?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGZjZGE5N2I0OTQ1NTg5ZWMwMTUxYmJkYjY3ZTdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Officer Dagon is a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fine</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> First Officer, and he is here because I believe he deserves to be recognised by Greatlord Oshiro for his service. He is my </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">guest</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, but he is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> my lover! Grandmother, stop asking such ridiculous questions!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODgxZGJiZDg0NDQwNmI5Yzk5Y2I0YjdmZGFhZTU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk!” The elderly woman clicked her tongue. “Well, better be so. We don’t want our noble family mixing with Southern blood! No offence, Officer Dahlberg.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTgzOGY5NTYwODRjODA4ZmJiZjU3YzE0NTdiYzhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...None taken, Ma’am,” Dagon mumbled weakly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDUwY2IwODE1MTRhMjA5NmU1NTU4ZTRkOTA2MjM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then!” The walking stick went </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">tap-tap</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as Serena’s grandmother came to a stop in front of Amelia. “This must be the human everyone’s blathering on about. Amelia Thornheart, is it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTcyZThjNzc0ZTRkNjE4YjBhZWJkOGIzNWUyNzE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Ma’am!” Amelia did her best to smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjIyOGQzYjEzMDQ3NGE5OGVkYTZiMDhlMzUxNjY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk! You’re pretty for a human, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2NlMWNhODNmZTRjOWFhNDUzYzgwMWYwZjkwZjQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Ma’am!” Amelia chirped.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjA2Y2ZmNDJiOTQ1ZWI4MWUyMDRhNjM2YmNlYjE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s a pretty human like you doing so far away from home?” The demon’s eyes narrowed as she placed both hands on her walking stick and leaned towards Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzk0ZmNiYmVjMzQxNDQ4MDdiYzMzOTUwZmJjNTkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia swallowed, her brain racing. “A call to adventure, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDgwZDVmMDNjOTRmZTZhNzgyOGM5YmRmZTliYWNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Adventure, is it?” The grandmother scoffed. “Quite a bit of luck, isn’t it? For your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">adventure </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">to lead you to the table of House Halen - producers of munitions - during</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> wartime</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” A dangerous glint appeared in her eyes. “And what if I were to accuse you of being a spy? What would you say then, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect Thornheart?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTMyNTgzYWE5ZjQ0OGM5MmEyYjEyMzZkOTM0ZTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grand-” Serena began, but her grandmother cut her off with a firm “Silence!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzVhODIwODNkZTRlMzE4NzI1OTVkYTg0MjMyYjU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia looked into the grandmother’s eyes and for a moment they just stared at each other. Forming her reply, Amelia opened her mouth and said, “I would say it would reflect poorly on House Halen, for they would surely have ensured my loyalty and status </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">before </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">inviting me to dinner with a Greatlord during </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wartime</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDJiYjBmMWRiYzQyYzg4YzM3MWE1NTI3YzVkNzRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hrmph. We could be setting a trap.” The grandmother scoffed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDI1MzcyYWUxYTQ0ZmRhZWVkMWQ5ZmQ1MjAyNzVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“With respect, Ma’am,” Amelia felt herself smile. “You’ll need more than a few Greatlords for that.” Next to her, Amelia could swear she heard Serena groan internally.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGIzNWE0MWE0YjQ1YzFiMGZlOWY5OWIzMzRkYjE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re sharp. For a human so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">young</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” the elderly demon said with a sly smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTFkMjEwYzQ4MjQzMDI5NWZjYTVmNTk0NzM5MDhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And so are you. For a demon so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">old</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Amelia cheerfully replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjFkOWI2N2M4NTQ3OGI4OWY5MDUzYjU0ZDdiYzkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!” The grandmother waved her walking stick. “So bold!” She turned and methodically shuffled back towards the entrance. After a few steps, she turned, eyeing Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjA4ODMwNTZmMjQ3MzNiMTQ3NTFiYzE3NTcyMDEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ll do just fine,” mumbled the grandmother. “Just fine indeed. Come on, you lot! Young Oshiro is waiting!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzhmZGMzNWFjYzQ5Yzg4ZjVlN2JmYjdjOWRiZTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Casting complicated expressions at each other, the trio followed the old woman into the house.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTBjZDA2YmYwNTQwNjdhMTgyMmFjNDJjMDFiYjJh" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time to dine with the Devil of the East!</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Forty-Six: Greatlord Oshiro</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM2OWY0NjlmZjM5ZjQ0MTg5NjI1OWQ5ODA2MzNjMjg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Oshiro POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/oshiro.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGRmMWZmMzgwYjRkMDdiNDVhZDYzYzdmNzc0ZGJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord Oshiro shifted slightly in his chair. It wasn’t that his seat was uncomfortable, the atmosphere awkward, or the temperature too hot or cold. No, it was his instincts as a warrior, honed to a standard worthy of his station through thousands of hours of religious practice, that caused him to adjust his weight. It wasn’t a conscious reaction, and he found his body preparing for combat before he identified any obvious threats.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjNjZDUyNjE3MDRmNDc4OGRhMDg3ODQ1ZjNkMjk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sensation lingered in his mind; the subtle screaming of his instincts informed him of one clear fact unnoticed by everyone else around him. Danger. But from where? It wasn’t from Highlady Halen, the pinnacle of Eastern nobility and Lady of the House Halen, who was chatting amicably while delicately sipping tea. Nor was it from the unparalleled beauty in discussion with her: his wife, Ashina Oshiro. Neither was the threat from the legion of skilled maids that served them with practised grace and elegance. Not even the houseguards, some talented enough to break into yellow aura, were enough to cause a second glance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjg3YWU3MTUwMjRiNWJhOTlmOWVlOTI4YmM5ZWY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The threat was outside and coming closer.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmU4ZTU5ODkyMzQ0ZGE4YmJlMDliODRmMTQwODhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While his wife and Highlady Halen discussed their travel plans after this year’s storm season was to end, Oshiro found himself alert for what was approaching. This was the source of danger. Every fibre in his body twitched in anticipation and excitement.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTEwN2NhYWVkMDRkYjc4M2U0NjYzZWJjODhiNTIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The door opened, and through it shuffled the foul-tongued mother of Highlady Halen. While the old bat was a force in and of herself, she wasn’t the source of his unease. Next came Lord-Prospect Halen; no, she was now </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Halen. His Overlord had beaten him to her long-deserved promotion. Serena was indeed a talented warrior and skilful captain. If the rumours were correct, she was on the verge of blue aura, a monumental achievement for a demon so young.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDY3ZTY4MTU0MTQwZTNiYmQ5MTZkZWYzZjQxNzE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet her formidable presence was not what set Oshiro on edge. The real source of the storm was the person who was half-hidden behind her. The singular person in this estate who lacked horns. The only human he had ever known to carry the crimson eyes of the most pureblood demons. The woman was warded and cloaked by countless layers of spellwork, the amount of which betrayed her titanic aether reserves, again betrayed by the fact that a similar amount of spellwork was being maintained upon the newly sanctioned Lord Halen.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTYxZmNjNzQ4OTQwMmU5ZGFjZGZmNTVhOTljNzc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Thornheart. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjUyYzIwYWZmNTQ1OTNiYjNkM2U1OTg4N2EzZTVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The young human mage invoked a reaction within Oshiro that was similar to how he felt when he faced his Overlord. It was a sensation only warriors like himself could experience. It was the promise of a great battle against a worthy foe. What would happen if he attacked the human right now? Could he win? How many Words would he have to Speak to break those wards? How would his aura handle her spellwork?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWU3Zjk1MjY5MTQ3ODBiNWUyMzk3MGFmOTZjNGEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something about him must have shown through, giving away his inner thoughts. Once Highlady Halen stood up and approached the guests, his wife turned towards him with a hardened stare.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjNjZTg5MmVmYTRkZDE4NTVlNWY3NjY4YTZkZjQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">No fighting,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she mouthed at him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDcwOWNhMTZkYTRlMjE4OTJhZTg1ZjZjMDgwYmQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He’d been caught! No one could read him as well as his wife could. Still, he would play dumb. He forced a surprised expression and turned his palms upwards as if to say, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What could you possibly be talking about?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM2NDA0MWM3ZmJhOTQ0MWNiOGE0YmNhMDc4OTFlZjQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">You’ve got that look in your eye again, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">his wife mouthed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTVjZGViZGQ5NzQ4ZjNhMWVmZjYxMjQwMTUwNzZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What look!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> He mouthed back.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTEzYzVlMDQ4MDQ1YWQ4ZGUyOGFmMzExYWY5Mzhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she replied, followed by a smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWZmOTUwMGM0ZTRhNDFiYzc1OTM0MjgxYzA0MjU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlady Halen brought over the guests: the grumbling old woman who cared little for decorum; Serena, with her sharp eyes evaluating the environment; Lady Thornheart, who was trying to appear casual, but the slight rigidity in how she moved betrayed her discomfort; and another demon from the South who seemed familiar, but Oshiro couldn’t immediately place him. Judging by the man’s uniform, he was likely Serena’s First Officer. Oshiro wasn’t sure who looked more out of place, the mysterious human or this Southern demon with a noticeable nervous sweat forming on his hairless head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDU1NzBjN2UwNzQyODRiY2E4YTRlMDE2YmFhMzI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you’ve met before, Greatlord Oshiro, but allow a proud mother to introduce…” Highlady Halen gestured to her daughter. “My daughter, Speaker, war hero, and now </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Serena.” The daughter in question snapped to attention with a perfect salute. Oshiro rose, doing his best not to stare at the human.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDBlMDdjZDkyODQ5OWJiM2U1YzRkZTMwZWQ0ZWJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“At ease, Captain,” he returned the salute. “Let’s not have the formality of the military distract from this casual evening.” After Serena relaxed, he added, “Tremendous work up north. I was about to sanction your Lordship myself, only to find I was beaten to it by our Overlord. You’ll make a fine Cascadian Lord, Captain Halen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGRjZDc1YWNhMTQyMzU4YzQzOGEzNzg1MWUxZGQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Greatlord,” Serena replied. “If it were my choice, I would have preferred to remain under the horns of the Eastern Admiralty.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDI0Yjk4OGYyOTQwYzFiMzNiNDZkYzhmYjA5YzI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oshiro felt the corner of his mouth rise at the compliment. If he had his way, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and its talented captain would remain under his horns. Nevertheless, an agreement was made between his Overlord and Centralis, and he was grudgingly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">encouraged</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> not to renew the lease. Again, he resisted a glance at the human. How many of these events were because of her?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDg5MjA3ZWEwNjQ0OTFhZDIwYWRkZjI1ZWRhOWI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Centralis has their way of doing things,” Oshiro intoned before Lord Halen’s compliment lingered into an awkward silence. “They may have their horns stacked with paperwork, but the Imperial Navy is competent.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzk0NDdkNzBjMTQ4NWVhYTY4MjczY2U1MTYxNDhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">When it’s forced to be,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> he added silently.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2NmM2M0NGQ2YzRjN2Q4OTNmZDI5ZTRjMDEzNTlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk!” Highlady Halen’s mother clicked her tongue, reminding Oshiro that the woman still hadn’t died. “Competent? Ha! They’re soft. Afraid to mobilise properly! It’s been eight years, and they still can’t put down the Republic. Soft, I tell you! Soft!” The old woman shuffled over to her granddaughter, tapping her cane against Serena’s uniform. “Serena here has more </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">grit</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” she said, clenching her free hand into a tight ball. “In one of her horns than the entirety of Centralis! You shouldn’t have let her go, young Oshiro!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmE1MGIzZGFlMjRjMjM4ZWU0OTkxZDU0ZDIyZmIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mother!” Highlady Halen protested, clearly attempting to keep her voice controlled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzAzMzk4NmI1NjQyMTBhNjE1ZDdkYWZhNTQyYjc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grandmother!” Serena blurted out, casting a nervous eye in his direction.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjA5ODc0ODVjNDQ4MDI5YzRiYjNlNDJiYzk1NDE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine,” Oshiro raised a hand, silencing the complaints. “I’m sure the esteemed mother of Highlady Halen </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wasn’t</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> criticising the orders of the Eastern Admiralty, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was she</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” He gave the old bat a hard stare who eventually looked away, clicking her tongue.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMThlZDhlNmVlYTQ2Y2U4ZTdkNTZiOWI4MWM0OWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no…” she mumbled. “I’m just an old lady, forgetting myself. Don’t mind me.” She waved her cane dismissively. “I’ll just sit here and have some nice tea…” The old demon shuffled over to a chair and began pulling it out. A maid jumped forward to assist but was quickly smacked away with a swipe of the cane. “Damn you!” she complained. “I can sit at a table just fine by myself, thank you! Help me when I’m dead! Hmph!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODgxM2NkZTg2NzRkOGFhNDI2NDIxZTU1ZGNhOWMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And…” Highlady Halen began with a weak smile and eyes that screamed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m sorry, that crazy old woman is a horn in my side!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> “I believe this is First Officer Dahlberg, an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">unexpected</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> addition to our little table. Officer Dahlberg, may I introduce you to Greatlord Oshiro and his wife, Ashina?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTI2MTdlNjE5MjQ5NDQ5MWUzMjMwNTBjN2VlNWJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Southern demon stiffened. “It’s an honour, Greatlord, sir,” he said quickly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2FiZDAwNDk0MDRjNmU5ZTJmMjA4NmY4NzIwOTBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dahlberg, is it?” Oshiro intoned, amused at how out of place the bald, muscular Southerner was in this environment. “Not many Southerners earn a commission in the Eastern Navy. First Officer, was it? It must be you keeping the ship in check when Lord Halen here is off winning battles and…” he paused, letting his gaze linger on Amelia Thornheart. “...Collecting </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">humans</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjA0ODBjYThiNzQ0YTFhMjllNjUzZWI1ZGJiODUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dahlberg mumbled something but Oshiro was more interested in the reaction of the human. He tried to decipher her nature and temperament, but the weak smile she gave wasn’t anything unusual compared to the typical unease most humans feel around demons. He looked expectantly at Highlady Halen, who quickly understood his meaning.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmMyZDU0MDMzMTQ3NGI4NzYyMzBlNmE4YWY0MGQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Finally, may I have the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">pleasure</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of introducing…” Highlady Halen began with a forced smile. “Amelia Thornheart, House Halen’s contracted advisor, healer…” She paused as if finding the words difficult to say. “And </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Lady Thornheart, I am thrilled to introduce you to Greatlord Oshiro and his wife, Ashina.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDcwMDBjNzM4NjQzYmQ5NGYxZmEwMGIxOTBiYTkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The human took a quick breath and began a curtsy in a practised manner that Oshiro could only describe as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">forced elegance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. “An honour to meet you, Greatlord and…” she paused, a frown appearing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTc4ZjU1OTJiODRhZWRhMzFjM2Q0YmY2MGU1NGY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlady</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena whispered, leaning ever so slightly in.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjE1MmMwYTFkOTQyNDg4Y2I1MDgwYTQzNzBlNjJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlady,” Amelia repeated, finishing her curtsy and rising back up. “I thought she was a Lord…” Amelia mumbled quietly and then jumped awkwardly, realising everyone had heard her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODVmMjJhZjRmZjQzNjRiOGU3YjYwNTAyY2U3ZjZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlady Halen sighed, rolling her eyes in a public display of disapproval. Ashina, however, raised a hand to her mouth and politely giggled. “I am a Lord, Lady Thornheart, and a Speaker in my own right. However, my title of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlady</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> takes precedence over my Cascadian title of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. That is unless I become </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord…”</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNjNWM0ZDQwOTM1MjQxNjVhZjk0YTIyOTBjYjdkYWQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The human nodded with sudden wide-eyed enthusiasm. “I see! It’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">awfully </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">confusing! This title overrides this other title, and then, it’s even more complicated when one of them’s a woman!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTRmNTQxODk1YzQwN2U4ZjE2YTgxNDE0MDUwYTBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Confusing?” Ashina gently laughed. “How amusing. I, among many of my friends, have been confused over </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the enigmatic and mysterious human who seems to be the subject of every conversation the last couple of weeks. Tell me, how was your trip from Shimashina? I hope the storm season didn’t make it too unpleasant…” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGUwZmNkMDU1YTRmMjliYzZkZWJjODdkOWUwMjM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While his wife tactfully set the human at ease, Oshiro’s brain churned as he tried to process the entity that was Amelia Thornheart. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t place her this way or that. The human was supposedly a diamond in the rough, a wandering healer from Karligard who had found her way to Cascadian citizenship. Yet she spoke in a flawless Centralis accent with a proficiency in High Imperial that was native.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDJiNTQzN2RmYzQxOWZhYzFhNjZlMDhlYTY5OWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only that, his Overlord had gathered the Greatlords and given them an overview of what had transpired during the downing of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakamoto</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The Overlord had personally confirmed it was the human who had Spoken the Second Word of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, throwing the Eastern fleets into a scramble and causing monster activity that was only just dying down now.</span></p><span class="cjI2ZTE4NGExNTQ1MDRlMDg5YzAwMDdjZGNkMzM4ZmNm"><br/>The tale has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM5ZDY1NjY0NTg1MDQ3MDJhN2M3NDgwZDcwNTI3OGUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia was surely much older than her looks suggested. Her reported age of twenty-five was an absurd age to have communed a Second Word. Oshiro would even go as far as to claim it impossible. Communing Words, especially the Second Word, drastically lowered the ageing process for the Speaker. Oshiro himself was almost as old as Highlady Halen’s grandmother, yet he appeared middle-aged. It would make far more sense for Amelia’s age to be closer to a century and her youthful looks to be maintained through her healing spellwork.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzQ2YzA2YTFlYjRhYzA5ZWQxYmRlYWI2YjFhNGE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet… it didn’t quite fit. Something else set him on edge. The Overlord had pulled him and the other Greatlords of the Three Sisters aside and gave them an extra bit of information, with a follow-up instruction to be polite in the human’s presence and not to prod her too hard.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODNmOGQwOTliMTQwNWVhNjU5Y2EwNGM5NTFlNDg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vikram!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> The human god had reportedly yelled the name of the Eastern Overlord through Amelia’s transformed mouth. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This daemon lord forced the connection! I couldst not break it!</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlM2Q2MGQ3ZTU5NjQ4ZjA4MzM4MzA3YmY3ZmZiYzMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Daemon lord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Why had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> used that term? Was it said in frustration, insulting the human who’d forced a communion with the god? Or did </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> see something that the rest of them could not? Was Amelia a demon in disguise? Or was she a demon trapped in a human form?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzYwZmI0MjQyNzRkNjM4YjkyN2Q2MzBhYjVhMDI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Overlord was confident Amelia was not a darkblade nor a product of their sick experiments with the soul. Unfortunately, it meant Oshiro’s mind went down another path. A path that seemingly fitted with all the information he knew about </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Thornheart, yet the conclusion it led to was one he had no idea what to do with.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTAwZDBhYmEwMzQwZTk4MDU1MTg3ZmE1YTM3OWU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Thornheart was the Empress in disguise.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2I5ODEzYTAwMjQ3MjQ5N2I3ZWJiMDhjNTIyNzk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It would explain almost everything. The Empress could take any form she chose, and a human one was well within her capabilities. She was powerful enough to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">force</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> communion with the human gods and hide herself from their eyes in this realm. It would explain Amelia’s mysterious origins, her flawless Centralis speech </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her tremendous power that tickled his instincts. It would explain why her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> embodiment took on so many demon characteristics and why her eyes remained a demonic crimson.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGI5N2VmM2VmMjQyOWY4M2Y0MGY5OWQyMGVhM2Zh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Did his Overlord know? It would further explain why he stopped the Greatlord of Kenhoro from placing Amelia under house arrest. Seven hells, Amelia even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">looked</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> like the Empress’s native Cerulean form. The height matched, as did the blond hair. But why? What was it about House Halen that the Empress felt the need to do herself? What was so important that it couldn’t be done through her faithful Overlord?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjJmNmQzYzg4NTQwOThiMDNkNjM3OWU0NzI2MTJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And why did it seem so obvious? Amelia’s power, her crimson eyes, her mysterious origin... they were all breadcrumbs towards an obvious conclusion, yet their placement felt sloppy. Or was it intentional? Did the Empress </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">want</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it to be known she was in disguise?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDliODg5ZDhmOTQ3YWI5MDlmY2JiNzU3OTZkNWE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever the truth of the matter, Oshiro, with his decades of experience, knew nought what to do with the information. If he had a specific part to play in the Empress’s plans, then a sign would come. If not, then he would continue to be the same Greatlord he always was and let whatever may be, be.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmU1YjUzYzQwNzQ2ZDg5MGY3YmMyNDMwMTYwYjEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t that right, dear?” Ashina said, casting him a friendly look. Oshiro had gotten lost in his thoughts. What had they been talking about? He forced himself to remember. A true warrior never missed a detail. They’d been talking about Lord Halen and Lady Thornheart’s concern over a human fitting in during her tenure as a teaching assistant at the Asamaywa Academy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmU0ODUzN2FlNzQzZWJhOGUzZDA0OTQ4OGE3NzFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” Oshiro said, taking a moment to clear his throat. “You’ll find the students respectful, if a little apprehensive over you being… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” He couldn’t resist emphasising the last word. “Nevertheless, many will jump at the opportunity to experience the capabilities of a human Speaker. Hopefully, you won’t disappoint. Also…” he looked around at the group. “We’ve been standing too long. Let us sit and sample some of our host’s excellent tea.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDdlNjAxMDExODQ3NTRhNDcwM2RkNzU5MTc1Yjc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once seated, there was a lull in the conversation as the maids poured the refreshments. Oshiro took a sip, delicately placing his cup back down. “Lord Halen,” he began, capturing Serena’s attention. “Are you aware you and Lady Thornheart will not be the only guest instructors for the semester?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Mjg4YWQ0YWVlNzRmMTRiYzdjNDM3MjI4MjQ3OGRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena blinked. “I was unaware, Greatlord. Who else will have the privilege?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGVhNzdlYTZjOTRhZmNiYzE2NzQ0YTBlZmNkZjhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Katalin of Driss,” Oshiro said, pausing in amusement at seeing Serena’s eyes go wide in an almost childlike fashion. The elusive swordswoman from the North was famous for her reclusion and religious devotion to the blade. She had already communed two Words and was on her way to a third. If she kept track, she would become one of the youngest Greatlords in Cascadian history.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTlkZjAxYTk3YjQ1NTBiMjM4MmNiN2U5NWYzMGM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Truly, Greatlord?” Serena asked. “Why would Katalin of Driss leave the North and travel here? Surely there are more preferable appointments she could claim in her homeland or Centralis?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWFhMzE3ZmU4ZTRmZDZhNDJkNDU3NjgzNGRjY2Iz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It surprised me as well,” Oshiro replied. “Her father contacted me to request permission. I didn’t hesitate to give it. She’s interested in experiencing </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimokan</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, and Asamaywa is the best place for that. However, she won’t be instructing a class of students, no…” Oshiro took his time taking another sip of tea. “She’ll be teaching and learning from the other instructors, including </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I hope you’ll do your very best to satisfy her thirst.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzM0MDYyMjhhNDRhMWVhODU5NWI1YTkyM2EzY2Iz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Serena said quickly, nodding with determination. “I will. Her sword favours the Northern </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hawk</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> style, if I remember?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGQ1YzY4ZGVkZjRlZGRhMDVkM2UzYTU4MzA3ZGFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oshiro nodded. “That it does. It’s a challenging style to fight, and it would be good for you to experience it. You’re breaking into blue, are you not?” Seeing Serena nod, he continued, “Sometimes a twist in the horn is helpful. The new perspective might help you solidify that aura. I’m sure Highlord Driss will be able to match the ferocity you require.” As Speakers became stronger it was harder to find a training opponent that could endure against them. As a result, the journey through the higher auras tended to be far more personal and less structured than the first few. An opportunity to spar with a legendary figure like Katalin of Driss was a valuable experience for Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTY1NzFhMjZhYzRlNmU4M2JlNGYxMDY4Njc4Nzkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I look forward to it. Thank you, Greatlord.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGExZDBhNTg0NDQzNmE5YTE4Y2Q4YWVjMWY5NmQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ashina leaned forward. “I’ve heard that Katalin of Driss is an unmatched beauty,” she whispered. “With fiery red hair and emerald eyes! They say men weep at the sight of her! Rather scandalous, don’t you think, Lady Thornheart?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWJlNWIwNGM1ODQwYmJhYzg0NTlhY2ZhMDc5N2Jl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The women continued to gossip, and Oshiro noted his wife’s attempt to include Lady Thornheart in their conversations. It also didn’t escape Oshiro’s notice that Highlady Halen was clearly not happy at the human's presence. She didn’t push it into the realm of rudeness, especially as his wife was making her friendly stance clear, but there was an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">absence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of inclusion from Highlady Halen that betrayed her dislike.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDUzZGI4N2M1MzRkOGY4ZTVmYjZjY2ZmOWJmZjRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">How would the Lady of House Halen react if he told her he suspected Amelia Thornheart of being the Empress? What would Serena say? There was always the possibility that Serena had more information than he had and was somehow involved in this mysterious plot. He briefly considered pulling her aside and ordering her to tell him, but something within him told him it wasn’t the right move.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2Q2OWQ5ZjE2ODRhZjNhNTY0MjBiZGMyOTAwNjlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Greatlord Oshiro, may I raise a matter?” Amelia asked politely after a lull in the conversation. All three women gave her the side-eye while the grandmother chuckled but thankfully didn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmJiMGZjNTRkODQ0NGI5YjQ1OTUzZmE5MDU4NWIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You may,” he replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTNhYTBjZjA1ZTQwODc5N2QxYTIwZDBhNmZkMzUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia explained that as a talented healer, she wanted to see if she could arrange to visit hospitals and provide her services. She’d raised the matter with Highlord Halen, who’d been somewhat critical of the idea and had correctly informed her it was not a small decision and could cause conflict between the Terra Firmas.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzc2YWU3YzQ1OTRkODFhMGM0NThjNmY4NWNjYzg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Demonkind had no gods of healing. Amelia Thornheart’s presence, whether she was a talented human Speaker or the Empress secretly forcing communion with the human gods, was nevertheless a drastic shift in the political landscape. Was this the Empress’s plan to bring healing spellwork back into the hands of the demons somehow? Oshiro resisted a sigh. It would do him better if he weren’t to try and guess such things. He would continue as if he didn’t have any suspicions regarding Amelia Thornheart’s true identity.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTAyM2VlZTRiZjRkM2Y5OWQxZjM5OTZmYzY5Mjlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were right to bring this up with me, Lady Thornheart,” Oshiro began. “I believe House Halen has already received many offers regarding your services. Highlady Halen?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2Y5NTFmNTIwMTQ2MTU4YmY4ZDk4ZmVkYjA4ZTlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s quite right, Greatlord,” Highlady Halen said through a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Thirty-seven letters, numerous requests for meetings, and I believe this very morning, a very determined messenger had to be thrown out by our guards! Your connection with House Halen has caused a plethora of complications that I hope you’ll do your best to resolve.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmM1YzAxMzE2MTQ1M2RiNDRmNDBiYmMxMDRkMDAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Choosing not to let the not-so-subtle implication of Lady Thornheart’s unwelcome presence linger for too long, Oshiro quickly added, “As you can see, there is a growing problem. If we allow you to heal the friends and family of Eastern Lords, then a conflict will arise with the nobility of other territories. If we disallow it completely, I fear we’ll be under entirely different kinds of pressure.” If they prevented Lady Thornheart from healing outside of her contract with House Halen, then they would face accusations of not </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">using</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the resource that was this human. Then, it wouldn’t be long until outside forces began trying to take her for themselves.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjZiODUxNTFiYTQyM2Y4YjAyMGMyMjQwMzViOGMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will raise this matter with my Overlord,” Oshiro declared. “I suspect an agreement will have to be made with other territories. For example, you would be permitted to restore a battalion’s worth of soldiers if there were a promise you would do the same in each of the other Terra Firmas. One son of a family here, for a daughter elsewhere. That kind of arrangement.” That was simplifying it. In reality, there would be even more fighting amongst the Eastern Nobility regarding who deserved Amelia’s healing. It would take the orders of the Overlord to contain it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGNiMGQ3ZDQ4NTQxZmE5MDcyMjdhYTgyYmJiMGVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay! I mean, thank you, Greatlord.” Amelia flashed a smile. “I look forward to your reply!” Oshiro didn’t know if Amelia’s casualness was out of ignorance, confidence or something else, but he didn’t comment and politely informed her that she was welcome.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTI5NTc4ZjJjOTRiNmY5MDk3NzBkOGNmZTk0YjRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Conversation continued, with a few jabs thrown in from Highlady Halen. Whether the human could tell or not, Oshiro wasn’t sure. Ashina would always bring things back down before they could boil over into an argument. As much as his wife looked to include Amelia, Serena did the same to her First Officer. Oshiro suspected the man had been dragged here against his will and would only speak when spoken to. As the table was set for dinner and the smell of venison could be caught from the kitchens, voices were raised when Highlady Halen learned her daughter would not spend her time in Asamaywa at the estate. Instead, Lord Halen and Lady Thornheart would favour the rooms at the academy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjJjOTQzNjc1MDQ4ZDM5MDQzMDdkZDAxMTBkNTg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Serena! I’ve barely seen you this year, and you’re going to hide away in that academy, training and teaching?” Highlady Halen protested. “Surely you’d prefer staying in the home you grew up in!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGI4OTk1YTNmMTQ0ZTRhMWJiNDM1ZTA2NDZkMTYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s simply more practical to stay at the academy,” Serena countered. “I miss you dearly, and I’ll find time to visit. We can go to the theatre this weekend.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGJhZGZhNjcxNDQwM2E5OTY0NTA0NTQ1ODBmZjVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“To the theatre?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODZjYTU1YjJhMDRjNzE5ZjljMjIxOWUyNTIwNmU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Mother.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWMzMWZkY2ZlZjQzNjdhNjk0ZjkyMGFjOTAwZDg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">us</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” Highlady Halen intoned, her brow slightly creasing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Mjc4YTU0OTRkYTRmNDJhMDVlMTI2ZjdkYTUxODMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">us</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena said, letting the smallest sigh escape.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTc0NWRjN2EzMTQ0YjRiZmRiNTVhODkyZDcwOTQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see I haven’t been invited!” the grandmother exclaimed in a huff. “Forgot I was here, did you? Hmm?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWYxZWFhNGViZDQ1ZmY4ZjEwYzhkZGNmZGExMmZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grandmother,” Serena said with a smile, “Would you like to come to the theatre with Mother and me?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODFiNDQ3ZWMwNTQwZjg5ODA2ODczMjM5ZTE0NjRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I hate the theatre,” the old demon grumbled. “Dreadful place. Too dark and too loud.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmU2ZTY1MjZlMDRlMzI4OWViZjA2NzE2YTkwNTNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The grumpy reply caused even Oshiro to chuckle. “Give my best to the Grandmaster, Lord Halen. I imagine you’ll see him tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODM2YTdhMmViYjQyNWQ5YmZjYjYzNzlhOTM5NmY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, Greatlord. We’ll be heading there after dinner,” Serena sniffed and glanced behind her. “Speaking of…” The house staff brought out dinner, an elaborate and extensive variety of expensive dishes suitable for satisfying someone of his station. The main dish, an enormous silver plate containing a deer lying on a bed of citrus fruits, was placed on the table.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTYwNjg1ZTFkYjRhODNhNWZhNzJhZGMwMWFjZGJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lady Thornheart!” Highlady Halen called out. “It appears the duty of carving has fallen upon you. If you could, dear.” She gestured towards the carving fork and knife. Oshiro wasn’t sure if anyone else heard the nervous swallow from the human. Amelia picked up the utensils, stood up and with a deep breath and a moment of hesitation, leant forward.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTY1ZWRjZWVlODRlMjk5NDk5MTQxZDk2NTgyM2Q1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What became of the expertly cooked deer caused a tense atmosphere to develop.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjVkNmQzZjZmNzQ2ODQ5NjIxMGFiNmVmODAwMWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia, dear,” Ashina said with amusement, “The poor creature has suffered enough already. No need to kill it again.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTBmMDhmNDcyYjQ4MjI5MTRkNTliNzIzYTdkNTA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes, Greatlady…” Amelia mumbled with a pained expression. Oshiro was pretty sure the human was mouthing the phrase “away from the bone” to herself repeatedly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTQ3NDA3NzA4NTQ1OWVhZTk3NTBhYzgwNWQ4MDM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, this display had certainly put a hole in his theory that Amelia was the Empress in disguise. The Empress was talented in countless skills, but surely even with a thousand years of practice, no one, not even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, could act out the awkward butchery that was taking place in front of his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MThmYmEzZGE2ZjRkMWNhZGRkMjgyNDZmMGJmOWQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Should Amelia Thornheart become a titan of the Empire, what was happening before him would be a story that would serve him well. Oshiro resisted a smile and simply sipped his tea.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjgyM2NjNTYyZTQ1NDBhNjhhMTQyMGNlNzFiNWY4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">What an amusing human.</span></p>

<p class="cnM0MDg0MjhhODc1MzRmYzdiYWIwMmQ1ZDQ2ZTU3ZjVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWFjMTE2NDk2NTRlMmRiNmQ2NDFlNGViMjRjMTc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage trundled away from Serena’s home and towards the academy. Inside, the pitter-patter of steadily increasing raindrops filled the carriage’s cabin. Serena sat, doing her best not to break out into a giggle. Amelia sat opposite her and judging by how she looked everywhere but at Serena, she wasn’t able to make eye contact.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDU1MzBhMTBkNTQyNjFiMDhjM2Y0ODlhYWU0ZDk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">something</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena said before biting her tongue to stop herself from laughing. With a mighty effort, she managed to squeeze out the question, “Did you… enjoy the dinner?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmQwYTViNjY0NDRjZDY5ZmUxNDY2N2FlYTA1MmQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhhh…” came the agonised groan. Amelia didn’t meet Serena’s gaze. Instead, she turned her head slowly and let her body tilt until her forehead smashed against the carriage wall. “I think,” she mumbled. “I think I want to die.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmVkYzE0YjY5MDRiMDk5ZDUwZjQ0MDFmY2IyNGJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nonsense!” Serena replied cheerfully. “It was a wonderful introduction to my Mother and Greatlord Oshiro! You made…” she intentionally paused for dramatic effect, “...a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">memorable </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">impression.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWE2MTExYTMyMTQ2MjI4ZWJhNGRmMWNlZmJlMTY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuhhhh!” Amelia whimpered, her eyes squeezed closed. “You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you? You devilish demon…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzcwOTg5YzVmZjRjZDhiMmY2NTY3MmEwN2RlNDdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!” Serena protested, forcing her eyes wide with innocence.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGZkNzliNGNlZjQ3YjE5NTZhMDY1MTBiNjdlNDcw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. She was. There was no way she would miss the opportunity to make Amelia squirm. Just like the human had done to her dozens of times with her crass innuendos. “All I want to say…” Serena raised a finger and placed it on her chin, tilting her head in mock thoughtfulness. “I think we should donate to the Asamaywa Carpenter’s Guild.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWIxMWU3YjlhMTRlOWM4NDE4YTIwY2I4ODA3NTM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?” Amelia slightly turned her head, giving Serena the side-eye. “Why?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWViNGNlYTIwODRlZTA4NzJlYzUxMTA3NWVmZWI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, for being able to create a dining table capable of withstanding such a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">brutal-</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzE5NzNjNjEwZjRkNGE5ZTEwYTRjMmIxYTY2OTFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop! Oh my god!” Amelia wailed, half crying and half laughing. “I swear I’ll hit you! I really will!” Unable to keep it down herself, Serena broke out into a fit of laughter. She laughed heartedly until her belly ached. She would never have laughed like this before, but now she felt like she could enjoy the moment to its fullest.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2YxNjJiMjVjOTQ2NDdiMTQ0ZmY2ZDcyMGMwZDNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia pouted before moving to sit next to her. Her blond head rested on Serena’s shoulder. “I think I might have been… out of my depth,” Amelia mumbled. Serena placed a hand upon Amelia’s hair, massaging and running her fingers through it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWY0ZDJkMjdiYzQ4MTk4NzA5YTAxNzZlZjIwM2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about it,” Serena said soothingly. “When I was a teenager, Father took me to my first ball. Trying to set me up with some newly sanctioned Lord-Prospect or another,” Serena smiled, remembering the events. “I was excited but </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> nervous! The moment we started dancing, I kept standing on all his toes and almost tripped over in front of everyone! I thought I’d never live it down! Ha!” She continued gently rubbing Amelia’s head. “Everyone’s nervous the first few times in front of someone like my Mother. It’ll get easier.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDI0ZGY5OGY0YjRjOGQ5N2Y3NGI0NWE4ZmNhMzk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She doesn’t like me, does she?” Amelia asked softly before clenching her fist. “She kept saying things in a way that I knew were sly comments, but I couldn’t figure out how to respond! It was so awkward…” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzA4MmNhOTVhMTQ0M2E5Njk4YWVhNTE1YWYxYjJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena made a noise of agreement. Her mother was masterful at her ability to control conversation and say ten different things with only a few words. Amelia couldn’t be expected to contend with her. Serena was confident that the benefits of having a Second Word Speaker aligned with her family would eventually win out over her mother’s disposition against humans. Serena didn't know whether that would happen over a few months or years. Hopefully, it was the former.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDBiOTQwYzlmNDRkNTQ5OGU3MmZiN2IyMzk1MWY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least your Father and Lani like me,” Amelia muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjE5ZmIzMThkODQxNmE4OTk1NzQyZTE2MGFmZjg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When one horn grows, the other withers,” Serena said pointedly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTQ4ZmE5MGE1YjRjZDFhZGRjNWRkYTA4ZThhNWI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia was quiet momentarily before asking, “Can horns wither?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDAyOTAxYzRlMzRjNjU5ZmRmYWE1MDEzMzk3OWFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWI5YTY5Y2NiNjQ3M2M5YWU2MjdlOGZmNDdmMTdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Stupid expression.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTcyOGY4NmEyNzQ3MzhhZjNmZWIzNjVlMjRkNmIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzI5YTVhMjg1NjQ5ZjliZDViNDg5YzVjM2Q5MmU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia turned her head, looking up with glistening eyes. “Stupid demon,” she said with a weak smile. She quickly smacked her lips together. Understanding her meaning, Serena bent down and kissed her before wiping Amelia’s tears of frustration away.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTYyMTg4NzgzNzQxY2E4YTVjZTdmOGI0ZmQ3MDMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stupid human,” she said, grinning.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2M4Y2NiZWFiODQ3NTRhYjkzNDBkMTFiM2I2NDVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm,” Amelia answered. She leaned away, moving the curtain and peering outside. “It’s raining hard…” she mumbled. “The moon’s really big.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjNmZmY5ZjI5NTRjNWY5ODM3MmMxMmVjMDkyMmM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not long now till moonfall,” Serena replied, peering out her window at the moon. The next moonfall was about a week away. She planned to take Amelia to one of the viewing towers to watch it. “Hopefully, no idiots get caught out and hit.” After each moonfall there would be a mad scramble for everyone to gather as many crystals as possible to sell to the authorities for processing. More often than not, a few daring demons - perhaps fathers with children who have empty bellies - would risk the falling crystals and try and harvest early.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Mzg0NGY0NzQ0NzQ1OTRhNTZlYWM2NjM3MzEwODRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does it damage the buildings?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzI3MzcwYTZmYzRmMmJiNzcxNTM4OGM5NjJlYjc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sometimes, but if you look, most of the buildings have reinforced roofs,” Serena explained. “And those that don’t have coverings that can be pulled over.” Most architectural designs across all cultures incorporated sloped roofs to help minimise the expected damage. The falling moon crystals did slow down as they got closer to the lumina as the aetheric-lumina reaction became stronger, but the larger chunks could still go straight through a non-reinforced flat roof or kill someone unlucky enough to be in its path.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2EzODZjOTRmNDQyMTk4ZGYzZjUzZDdhZjhmZTQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How much falls?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjU0YTRjZDQxODQ2NDM4YmMxYzJiNTM2YTMzNmQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Across the Eastern cities and their inhabited surroundings? Tens of thousands of tonnes, give or take.” Serena wobbled her palm. “Far more throughout the Great Wilderness, although accessing it isn’t viable for most.” Speakers and other talented adventurers </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">could</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> venture out and harvest, but those with that capability often had better options for income. The exception was red crystal, which was traded at a premium due to the war effort. Serena heard there was a booming business for those willing to risk the desert sands.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjQwYzczNThhNjQ3MzFhYTAxZmY2NzA1Y2JiNGZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So much…” Amelia said to herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzRhMDcwNTdjZDQxYzE4MzFiNzdiMjVkZTgwYjli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A comfortable silence took over the carriage. With a background of soothing rainfall, the pair of them stared out their respective windows, lost in their thoughts. The carriage jolted as it came to a stop and Serena realised she’d lost track of time and they’d arrived at the academy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjc2ZTc4YmQxNTQ4NzM5OGZkMDg2MWI2ODU0N2Jh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone was talking to the carriage driver. Despite the heavy rainfall blanketing the city, Serena could easily make out the conversation. A female speaker was explaining that the academy path was being repaved and that it wasn’t suitable for a carriage. They would need to walk. The driver - a long-term employee of House Halen - argued quite passionately against the inconvenience but ultimately relented. With the sound of boots splashing through water, the figure knocked on the carriage door. Serena opened it, revealing a drenched figure; their raincoat and hat had not sufficiently defended them against the pouring rain.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGQ4YzMyZTQxMzQ4N2RiZjg4YmZjMjZkZWE4M2E0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Halen!” They called out. “I apologise for the inconvenience, but you must walk from here! We’re repaving the entire road, and the carriage won’t be able to get past!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2U2NjMyYzcxMjQ4Njk4MWZlOTI3ODYwNDc1NjQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who are you?” Serena demanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjJhOWE4OTEzZDQyZWNhYjMwMThjM2I0MWE4MTky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m Instructor Kawas!” yelled the figure through the rain. “We drew straws to see who would come out here and get you!” Instructor Kawas leaned slightly, looking past Serena at the other occupant of the carriage. “Lord-Prospect Thornheart! Welcome to Asamaywa Academy! Do you prefer to be addressed as Speaker or Lord-Prospect!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2M5NzRlMWNhYzQyMmU4MWI1ODgzYWYwMmQyZjVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm,” Amelia bit her lips before collecting herself. “Lord-Prospect is fine, Instructor Kawas!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmE1N2Y2N2E3MTQ5YmNiN2Y4NGMzNTFkNjJjNjkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent! I apologise for the weather! Please follow me; we’ll be there in no time!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDNlYzU0ZDI2YjRjZGQ4NjcyZGI5Njg4NGY4NDFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena climbed out of the carriage, instantly becoming drenched by the rain. She hadn’t had the foresight to bring a rainhat. Nevertheless, the frantic rain and the air getting colder by the day did little to distract her. Even without Amelia’s wards, Serena’s aura was sufficiently powerful enough that she could sleep in a freezing, muddy trench perfectly fine. Of course, that didn’t mean she wouldn’t seek better sleeping arrangements if possible.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTIxZmQ2YmM2MjQ2ODQ5NDAwNDg5YWYzZjUxNmY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia followed and the moment she stepped off the carriage, her aether surged. The sudden unannounced spellwork caused Serena to prepare herself instinctively while Instructor Kawas stepped back with an expression of surprise. Soon, it became evident neither of them needed to have worried, as an external ward formed several meters above them. At about a dozen square meters, the ward generously blocked out the rain and the noise of the water took on a cosy, muffled quality.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTllM2Y0YjRjNTQ3ZDc5MDExMTljODNkYzg5NGJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your-” Instructor Kawas began yelling but quickly stopped, realising she could talk normally. “Your talents seem true to the rumours, Lord-Prospect Thornheart.” The instructor took a moment to peer at the ward above. “So large… and so quickly cast… and so silently…” She peered at Amelia momentarily, an element of awe forming in her eyes. “I hope all human mages aren’t this capable.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzNmNGVlZWQ3MzQ0OWQ4ODAwMDg0NjY0M2NkOTdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t think you’ll need to worry about that…” Serena muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDM4YTI2NWUzOTQxM2JhYjRiODMwZjYwYTVjZWQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Halen?” Instructor Kawas said with a tilt of her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjY1OTFiNWU0MzQ1NzlhNWRlYTUxNTM3YzdjNDFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Never mind.” Serena decided to change the subject quickly. “What subject do you instruct at the academy, Instructor Kawas?” She gestured along the path. The instructor took her meaning and began leading them through the wet and muddy academy grounds.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGVhZjRlNjI3MzQ2NmNhNDAzZmU0MDljMmQzMzNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Air tactics,” the instructor replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDQyY2FlYTI5NTRmMzc5YTZkOGY3ZDJhNjVjNGEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where did you serve?” Serena asked. Unless you were a Speaker, it would require an unbelievable amount of talent to be allowed into an instructor position. The vast majority of academy instructors would have earned the position through their service record. Instructor Kawas, from Serena’s best guess, was a second-circle mage. She must have had at least one deployment.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2IyZjNiNTliNzQ3NGE4MGU2MWY4NjBlMGFhMjc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did two years on the destroyer </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fubuki</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Got hit in the battle for Ravensburg. Went down. Ever since then, I, uh…” the instructor paused and Serena caught a tinge of red forming on her cheeks. “I was never able to sail again. I get terribly airsick whenever I’m on a ship, you see. It was fine before we went down. Now… Not exactly the most glamorous ending to a military career, is it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGM0Mjg0MGE4NzRmMDVhNjIwNGQ2Y2Q5OWRlM2E1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could be worse,” Amelia pointed out. “Could be dead.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Mzc2NzUwOTVmMTRlNTFhNDM5YmMwMDhiZWY5MjM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye,” Instructor Kawas nodded. “Could be. Careful.” She pointed at a particularly slippy part of the road where construction meant they had to tread across the muddy grass. “Was given a choice. Fill a ground tactician role on the front, or become an assistant instructor here. I figured my brain would be better used teaching air tactics to the promising students here than me sitting in a command bunker somewhere getting shelled while I pushed models around on a map. Oh, speaking of air tactics, Lord Halen. Many of us are tremendously excited to hear how you and your officers approached Port Highwind.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjFkYzBjY2E0ZjRmYTNiMGRkNzlkMzJhYzA1Y2Qy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll find time to go over it,” Serena said. “What’s going on here?” She pointed at the construction work along the path. They seemed to be laying down pipes just underneath the pathway.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTRhODdlZTlkOTRmYWViYmY1OTM1NDZhNDcyOGMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Steam pipes,” Instructor Kawas explained. “For heating. The pathways freeze in winter and you have students twisting ankles and bruising this and that.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjAyNjVjY2U3OTRjOWZiMTA1MGIxMWFkMDhkOWNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you salt the pathways?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTU1YzA1OGFjNDRkMmZhNjZhMTE5NTBiM2M1ZjIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Salt’s expensive these days,” the instructor explained. “And we’ve had our funding increased every year for the past five. Budget’s three times what it was when you were here, Lord Halen. Hmm… maybe I should ask for a raise…” While Instructor Kawas mumbled about salary negotiations, Serena looked around. With her eyes that easily saw through the darkness she could see many new buildings had been erected in the years since she had last been here. She noted the new additions to Instructor Kawas.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDkzYTkwYWQ3YjRlZmFiYTQxMGViYzRiOWJhMzJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye,” she replied. “War demands more warriors and mages and more of those require more students and more students require more infrastructure and teaching and more of that…” Instructor Kawas took a much-needed breath. “...Requires more funding,” she finally finished.</span></p><span class="cjU1ODIxYzViNzk1NDRkNjM5Yzk1YTE4OTAyOGZjMDYw"><br/>If you come across this story on Amazon, it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM2Y2NhMDRlNWY3NjQ0N2I4NWE4MTc2ZDBhYmI1MTMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many instructors?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODlmN2Q3ZjQzYzRjZTdiZjEzYzk1ZjE3N2E5Mjc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… not sure, but the total staff across all departments is a little over two hundred for fifteen hundred students.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzdiMTZjM2E4NTRhNWM4MGZhZmUyZTlhZjAwZmZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt her eyes go wide. Fifteen hundred students? When she was a student, she was one of about four hundred. In such a short time the academy had almost quadrupled in size! Greatlord Oshiro must be pouring gold into this place!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzAwNTc1NDkxZDQwZDE4NTg2MjNhYTkwNDNjNjVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re here.” Instructor Kawas stopped, and Serena looked up, feeling a sense of nostalgia at the familiar three-story building. The main door was closed but from within she could sense a small gathering of talented individuals. It seemed that a dozen instructors had elected to wait for their arrival. Serena briefly wondered if they were here for her, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">war hero</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, or Amelia Thornheart, the human Speaker.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTZmNzI1NWIxZDQ0NjdiOTZiOGZjYzNhMjcwNzU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that…” Amelia mumbled while tilting her head to be almost sideways. She was pointing upwards, and Serena followed her finger to see that she was pointing at the great wooden beam above the main entrance, where a series of fake sword marks were made to trick the first years into thinking it was some fantastic secret technique. About two-thirds of the way across were the marks Serena added in her second year as a reward for winning that year's tournament. She tilted her head and noted with some satisfaction that yes, her marks still resembled a smiley face.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjJkZmFiMjhiNzQ5ZTBhZTA0NGE0MzY2NmIxNGVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It even had a little tongue!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmFlOTNlOGIzYjRlMzFiYjM2YzM5NzI3YWU1Y2Iy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s it!” Serena said with pride. Seeing Instructor Kawas look confused, Serena explained the story, prompting the woman to laugh.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWZjNGViMGRlMjQ2NTdhNTMxMTdkYzJiMmI3Y2Yy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I win the tournament, could I add marks?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjg4MTQ2ZGM5NzQzNGJhYTNjYWQ5YjdiZWI4ZTMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instructors can’t enter,” Serena explained, shaking her head. “And even if you were a student, Speakers cannot enter. It’s too much of an advantage.” Serena didn’t mention that even without Speaking Amelia could probably quite easily power her way through the tournament. She decided not to mention the great </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker Olympiad</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> which took place in Centralis every four years. If she did, Amelia would surely turn up and cause a tremendous ruckus!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTRiOGIxMDYwMTQ0NzA4NTcyYWVmZDZkNjg5NWQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once they moved off the muddy ground and onto the stone foundation, Amelia cast her cleaning spell, and every iota of mud and water vanished from their clothes and bodies. Instructor Kawas saw this with wide eyes. “That’s amazing spellwork!” she exclaimed. When Amelia offered to do the same to her the demon nodded enthusiastically. Once the spell had been cast the instructor pulled at her clothes in awe. “They’re bone-dry…” she muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWIzYjlhOWY0MzRjNDE4MmQxYjc2YzM4MmExNTdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instructor Kawas, I believe we have a party waiting for us,” Serena gestured towards the main door.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjI0MTE0NTViNzQ1MzhiODc5NDM5YWYzZTljOTgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The instructor snapped out of her trance. “Yes, apologies, Lord Halen!” She pushed the heavy door open and waved them in. “May I formally welcome you both,” she said proudly as they stepped through. “To Asamaywa Academy!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTc2NWJmZGI5YTQ5YWU4N2M0Y2RmY2Q4N2FiOTk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of all the things Serena expected when she stepped into the entrance hall, a round of applause wasn’t one of them. A dozen senior instructors clapped heartily, with some bowing slightly with respect. Some she recognised, albeit the passage of time had etched itself on their faces, and some were unfamiliar. Serena soaked in the applause awkwardly. She waited for it to die down before offering her bow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTUyZjk4ZmE4MDQ2ODdhOGMzOWJmNjVjYTkzM2Qx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s an honour to be welcomed so warmly by so many senior Instructors,” Serena intoned politely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Yzk5YWMzZDlmNjRlZTNiYjhlYjUxZjBiNGFlODAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before anyone could say anything else, a gruff voice called out, “Let’s see, let’s see!” From around the corner, the head of the academy, Grandmaster Shun, appeared. Striding forward, his imposing figure stood out amongst the crowd of talented instructors. His clothes were damp with sweat. Had he just come from training?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWFiYWVhYmI1YzRhNzA5NDRjNjNmZmYyYTQ4ZjNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He stopped before them, his towering figure standing more than a full head height above Serena. She’d forgotten the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">presence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> this demon carried with him. When she was a student, her knees would shake near this man. Thankfully, she was made of sterner stuff now and was able to face him with an expression full of respect rather than fear.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTRjZmQ4NDA1NDQ4ZjNiZDQxZWUyOTA5MDhkM2E5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Serena Halen…” he grumbled, eyeing Serena up and down appraisingly. After a moment, his gaze lingered on Amelia who, to her credit, seemed unfazed by his steely stare. “Amelia Thornheart…” He clapped his hands together. “Come to my office tomorrow, both of you!” With that, he turned and strode off.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDFjMDUzMzdhZjRhYjViZGE5YmVhNDFmZmJkOTMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Back to training, most likely. Well, the man was known to dislike small talk.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzcwMTNiNDk5YTRiNDdhMDQ5NWY0OGMzOWQ3YWZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once he’d gone, one of the instructors approached her with his hand outstretched. When Serena took the demon's hand, she could immediately tell he was a great warrior far beyond her capabilities. His horns suggested he was ethnically Eastern, but the blue tinge in his otherwise red eyes suggested he had some Centralis heritage.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzM5YTNjZWQzOTQ3MzY5Y2MzY2FhMzgwNGRkY2U3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nathaniel Endo,” he said smoothly. “Department of Combat Training. It’s an honour to be working with a war hero, Lord Halen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGE2NzFkZGZhMjQxOTFiODAxNDU2N2E2MzcwMzc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> who should have the honour, Sir,” Serena responded. She knew this name. Nathaniel Endo was a known dual-Speaker with a long list of achievements that far outstripped Serena’s somewhat limited career in the military. “But please, call us Instructor and Assistant Instructor.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDc2YzRhMWQ3NTRhZDliMGQ1N2VmZDUyZmZjNzdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nathaniel nodded before moving on to shake Amelia’s hand. “You have the soft hands of a mage, Assistant Instructor Thornheart. Yet I hear you’ve taken an interest in the sword?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjI2OGQ2YWE1MzQ5ODg4NGM1MDczYjEyNzkyNGYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” Amelia grinned. “Serena, I mean, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Halen has been teaching me! Also, I’ve had further instruction from Grandmaster Gu of the Kenhoro Academy!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjBmNjI0MjFlYzQyNzlhNDMxYTJmODc2ZDgwZmVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I’ve heard,” Nathaniel mused, rubbing his chin. “Never had the honour of training under him myself. What’s he like?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjhhMDZhNGU3YjQxMTZhZjY3ODMyYzU0NjUyMWVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t take him long to start shooting me with a pistol,” Amelia replied, referencing the enhanced training the grandmaster and Serena put Amelia through. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjdkNjBiZWIyNjQ0N2NhZjAyZTE4ZTRmODAzYmFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nathaniel laughed at the reply. “Sounds like what we do here, although we typically wait a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">little</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> longer than a few days before shooting our students.” His statement caused a ripple of laughter amongst the other senior instructors. He took a step back. “You’ll both be seeing a lot of me,” he explained. “Although, Assistant Instructor Thornheart, you’ll be working under Instructor Inoue, our resident expert in combat magic. She’s…” Nathaniel looked up, as if hoping the words would fall into his mouth. “...Not here right now, but you’ll surely meet her tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTZmYzU3OWUzZTQyMzNiMGE2Yjc4MmVjODdkODFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t wait!” Amelia chirped.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODQ4YmU4MzFiNTRkN2NiNWVhNzJlYjI5ODZjNzY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nathaniel bowed and left the entrance hall. Once he had left, the remaining instructors all stepped forward and introduced themselves. Some only gave a polite greeting while others were more friendly. Some reminisced with Serena about her time as a student while others were more interested in Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjE0MDc3ODkzODQzYTdhNjI4ODMyOTc2NDZlYmEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ryosuke Yamamoto, Department of Leadership and Ethics. Instructor Halen, it’s an honour to see you again. It feels like yesterday you were in my classroom!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTBiY2FkMWE5MTQ1MjE4NWU1NTQ3MzMxMWE2OWQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sarafina Nakajima, Department of Intelligence and Security. I’ve been told you’re due for a refresher course on the latest cryptographic methods. It’s dreadfully boring, but I’m sure we can manage.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTE5NWEyNjYxNzQ1MjY4OTcwOGI3OGE1NDkyNzBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kenji Tanaka, Department of Tactics and Strategy. I see you’ve already met my colleague, Instructor Kawas. We would be delighted to hear about your adventures in more detail, Instructor Halen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWQ3N2Q1MTZkNDRhNDVhNmY5MGQxZWIwNjc2M2Y1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Emalina Honda, Department of Medical and Battlefield Care. Assistant Instructor Thornheart. I am </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> interested in discussing your healing magic. Could I possibly steal you for a few lectures?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTIxZGU1ZTkzMDRhZjhiODBmZjcyNDRkZmFiZDBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">One by one, they came and went. Serena did her best to memorise them all. It was a surreal experience to have so many people she looked up to hold her in high regard. She couldn’t help feeling her ego bubble up just a little.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTU1ZmI2ZmRhNDQ3NmU5YzIyMTY1MmRlMjNkNThi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There were more departments than when she was a student. A demon named Sebastian Kimura led the newly created Department of Communication, while Noel Yamaguchi led the Department of History and Military Studies. There was also Mina Shimada who headed the Department of Logistics, which had recently split off from the Department of Naval Operations, led by Kaito Mori. A gruff demon who smelled of grease and metal called Gregory Takeda taught the Department of Engineering. Apparently, he knew Allston, her Chief Engineer aboard the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Finally, there was Joey Ito, who put the students through the seven hells with his Department of Physical Training.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDg1Y2JiZTE4YzQwMmI4NDE5OGIxYWVjYjkwMTVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After everything was all said and done only Instructor Kawas and Instructor Nakajima remained. The latter yawned before telling Serena, “Instructor Halen, your lodgings are this way.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGZjYTYxNGNhZTQyMWQ4YTk0YjlkMDE0NjZmOTBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assistant Instructor Thornheart, if you could follow me this way,” Instructor Kawas politely bowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDg0NzQ3YzA0YjRiZjVhYThiZmNmNGUzYzBmZTkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena raised an eyebrow. “We’re not to be in the same building?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDAyZmE5M2Q1YjQ3NTk5OTk4MTZmNWI1MDZhOGNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor Nakajima shook her head, waving pitch-black hair. “Instructors under Nathaniel stay in the main building. Those under dear Lunaria are all housed in the new building for the Department of Aether Studies. Is there a problem?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzRjYzdiNDk5ODQyYTJiNzZlNGI0MDNlMWY4OTUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGMyNjYwZWZkYTQ5MmRiZmYzNTVmZjgzMDQ1Njg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem!” Amelia said cheerfully. She whispered to Serena, “I’ll see you tomorrow!” With a wave, she bounced away with Instructor Kawas speed-walking to keep up. Serena resisted the urge to sigh.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzU0ODUzN2I2ZjQ3ZDBiYWU0MWY2Mzc5MzVlMDNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Strange human,” Instructor Nakajima muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTg2NjM3MzBmYzQ2OTI5MGExNzAwMmU2OWJmZjhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re telling me,” Serena answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDI0M2I5NDIxNTRmMTJhMTJlZjk4Y2Q5MTE0MjM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena hoped she’d be able to sleep this time, without Amelia’s warm body nearby. Even on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> they had separate hammocks but were still in the same </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">room</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzA2YTMyMzBkOTQ2MWI5NjM1YjRiZWY0ZGY1OGQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she could hug a pillow instead.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTI1MGIxZDY4MTQyMGI5MzhkYTVkOWM1OWFlNjBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about how she could best arrange bedding to resemble her dear human, Serena mumbled simple replies to Instructor Nakajima’s questions while she led her through the building.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODVlYjAzMjA4ODQxZmI5MmQ4ZDJlNjIwNTliZDdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDdjZGRhYzY5MzQyNTRhMzJjMGRiN2RhYTA0YjZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTljZjc5MmEzMTQ4ZDY4ODEzYTNkYTdhZDM2MDUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia hummed as Instructor Kawas led her through the hallways. They left the main building through a side door and headed towards another building. Amelia didn’t need to cast any magic for the rain as the academy had built a wooden structure covering the path between the two buildings.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Zjc4MTg4YjM4OTQ0YTNiNTM3OWQzODBjZGZjODUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s well-lit,” Amelia said, noting the numerous aetherlights that shone with a sharp white light, illuminating the rainy night.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzE0ZDQzMjAwMDQ1YWU5MWEzOTA0OGU5MTE0ZTBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It used to be gas lamps,” Instructor Kawas replied. “With all the new funding we’ve been able to modernise quite a bit.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWM1MWM2YTFkZjRiODk4MWU0MzE3ZjU5ODc2YzM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They continued into the Department of Aether and began climbing the long spiral stairs that snaked their way all the way to the top floor. The building was perhaps ten stories tall and Amelia noted they’d used wooden beams to try and hide the steel beams used in its construction.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTNiNTJmNjBiMTRmZWM4MmNhMDkwZGU0NTY0YWZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor Kawas tried a few times to prod a little at Amelia and her magical talents but she was given mostly non-answers. Amelia would hide her true skills up her sleeve. Only Serena was allowed to know everything!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2IwYzYxNzQ0ODQzZjA5ZGU5NmM5NTM0NGZhM2I0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve been appointed an assistant,” Instructor Kawas suddenly said when they stepped off the stairway. Amelia stopped, not being able to stop her mouth from dropping open.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTgxOTRhMDM1ZTQ2YWQ5NGI4ZGVjMTg1ZWE1MzNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me?” she asked, pointing towards herself. “An assistant?” Seeing Instructor Kawas nod, she added, “What would I need one for?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzNkY2QzNzE1OTQ4NDViMjU4YzQwODliN2EwNzY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All the minor tasks that might take time away from your teaching or training,” the instructor explained. “Passing messages to other members of staff. Retrieving or returning books from the library. They can also assist you with experiments, should you conduct any.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGNlYWE2MmIzMTQzZGM4ZjIyOTZjYTgyODI0NjU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded. The reasons made sense. Still, could she act appropriately as someone’s superior? She supposed all she needed to do was channel a bit of the confidence Serena displayed in her infamous Captain mode. “Who are they, a mage?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDUzOWI3MDMwZTRhN2U4NjQ0YmZmOWJhNTVmZDdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, Instructor Kawas shook her head. “Due to your interest in swordsmanship, someone made the decision to have a warrior assist you. It caused a bit of politicking because while you’re a Speaker, none of the senior students wanted to work for a, uh…” the woman suddenly looked down.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWFiZTFhM2M1YTQwZjhiNzA2NWM3MDEyMDI0OGQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Work for a human, right?” Amelia said with a reassuring smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzRlMmViNWJlNzRmMzg5OWZiNDVkNTFlMTdjZmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Assistant Instructor Thornheart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODg5YjFiOGI1NDQ2M2NhNTk3NjdiMzY0YTQxZjc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be,” Amelia waved it away. “So you found someone, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGQ1MDVhYjRmZDQzYzQ5Y2FhYWM3NDBmOTI4OGFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Instructor Kawas nodded. “They- ah! Here we are…” they stopped in front of a door. “These are your quarters. You have your own bedroom, reception room and bathroom. You’ll find appropriate clothes and other necessities inside. Your assistant will be able to help you with anything you require. Speaking of…” Kawas motioned to a door at the end of the hallway, from which a soft yellow light bled through the gaps in the doorframe. “They seem to be awake. I suggest you introduce yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2MyOTExY2I0MTRlZmI4ODZhMTQzN2Y3YzZlMDUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay!” Amelia clenched her fist. Before she had taken two steps, Instructor Kawas stopped her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjk0NWQyM2IxYjQwODA5OTUxM2Q3NWU2NGFmNzBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A bit of a warning. They don’t actually </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">know</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you’re a human. They’ve only been told they’ll be working under a talented Speaker for a semester and jumped at the opportunity.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDY5MjUyZDgxODQ2ZDQ5ZGViM2FkNmEwNTU5Y2Zi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They don’t know who I am?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDAzZGE0YjI0MzQ3YWFiZDNjZDZjNTdmOGI3NTEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, they’re a foreign student. From Kenhoro…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWUyNDg5NTY2YzQ1MDc5M2M2N2QxMjMzZmU3YzNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh? Did Grandmaster Gu recommend someone? It sort of made sense. Kenhoro was more cosmopolitan, so finding a student who would be okay working with her would be easier.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzAxMTRkZTYxODRhMGM4NDk5YTA2OWNjZDVmZGIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, it was strange they didn’t tell them who she was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzY0Yzc0MzA0YTQ3NTRiODE1NjU0NWM2YTIxZjI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry!” Amelia said reassuringly, more to herself than the apologetic-looking Instructor. “I’m sure we’ll get along fine!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjE4MTBjZWI3ZTRjODJhOWQ5YzExNGI5MWNmMWNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a relief,” Instructor Kawas said with a sigh. “Then… I’ll leave you be. Any problems, you can contact reception at the bottom and someone will come and sort things out. Goodnight, Assistant Instructor Thornheart.” The woman bowed, and soon her steps vanished down the winding staircase.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGI2NjczMTVmNTQzYmQ5Y2VjNGQ5ZDE3NjExNWVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia gulped and approached the door of her assistant. Casting some magic to quieten her footsteps and disguise her presence, she crept right up to the door. Straining her hearing, she listened. Footsteps. Someone was inside and by the sound of their feet they were pacing back and forth. Were they as anxious as she was? Hopefully they were. It would make things easier for Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDJmOTMyZDdiYTQwNDZiMjYyZmJmMmNiZTUyZGU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking a deep breath, Amelia wore her very best</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> lets-be-friends</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> smile and knocked quickly on the door. At the sound of her knocking, the person inside squealed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDA1ZmJmMzYzNjQwNzU4NzQ2MDYzOGQxMTFmZWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman, by the sounds of it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGRmMzU0NzgzMDRjOGVhYWEwNWMyYTdmZTQ3MDI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was the sound of frantic movement that stopped on the other side of the doorway. Amelia could hear them take their own deep breath.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWEzNTk3NGRjYTQwYTA5NTBiNzE5NjI2ZjgxNTQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The door opened and revealed Amelia’s assistant holding a lantern.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTEwZTQ4YzdkYjQzMWM5YTdjNGMyZTg1MDU5M2E1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello!” Amelia quickly chirped. “I’m Amelia, pleased to- Y-y-you!” She felt her eyes go wide and she raised a finger at the surprised demon who in turn dropped the lantern. It shattered upon the wooden floor.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjE2ZDk2MGFmODQ4NzM4ZTg2YTRmNzE5MDY5MGNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what are you doing here!?” the assistant cried out, a note of fear in her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWMxZjIzN2UwNDQwNDU4ZmZkMjAyOTE0ZjA0NWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that’s my line!” Amelia exclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWI0OGIzMDhmMzRhNzI5NzE4ZTljZGIyZDU2NTE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel stuttered, her expression looking every bit as confused as Amelia felt.</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Forty-Eight: The Northern Swordmaster</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNjMjRlNTVlYjVhNzQ5ZjNhZDg1NDk1NzFjMGI5MzNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmI4MGE5YzFkNjQ5ZTZiMjg0MGE5MzMxMzNhYjQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time in a long time, Serena woke up in an Amelia-less room. Her sleep had undoubtedly suffered for it. She’d become accustomed to the soft warmth of Amelia’s body next to hers, and without her girlfriend’s gentle breathing, the night seemed awfully quiet. She’d tossed and turned for an hour before arranging no less than three pillows into a line next to her, which she held until she eventually fell asleep. The pillows were a poor substitution for her human but they had saved her from a sleepless night.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMThlYjU5ZWE4MTQxNzhiOWYwYzM5MmRlM2M3Y2M4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She even found she missed Amelia’s snoring. Amelia refused to admit that someone ‘as cute as she was’ would snore, no matter how often Serena complained about it. It had gotten to the point where Serena was prepared to bring in an axiom crystal to record her as evidence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2VlZGMxNjJmYjQxMmU4NTQzYmUxOTcwNmViYjE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was early, and only the very first tendrils of the morning light were streaking through the windows. Before she’d manifested the first aura, mornings like these would be a sordid affair as the chill in the air would send shivers down her back, forcing her to remain in the warmth of the bedding. Now, many years on, getting up and starting her day was an effortless routine.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjBkZTA4YmNlNTRkNDk4Y2Q4MTliYjdiZTUwYmVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena washed and dressed. She’d been provided with an instructor's uniform. The clothes balanced practicality and military fashion, invoking a sense of dignity and authority. A yellow belt tied it off, signifying Serena was capable of at least the third aura, the highest aura achievable before needing to Speak the First Word.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2YxZjIzMmJlMjQ1ZDM4NTBhOTU5ZWE4NjliYjI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving her lodgings, Serena made her way down the stairs and through the nostalgic corridors. She wasn’t seeking out Amelia, or anyone else for that matter. Serena was making her way towards the training hall. Her time in Kenhoro under Grandmaster Gu made her realise how few hours she’d spent personally training. Her time was eaten up by her military duties, time which was further occupied by a certain bundle of smug blond energy. Serena planned to make full use of the Asamaywa facilities while she was here for the semester.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjg2NDdlZmJjMTQ0ODA5OTVjYjVhNjJmNDU5ZDkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">On her way, she didn’t see a single pair of horns. The vast majority of the academy was still sleeping, and it would be another hour before the kitchen staff woke to prepare the students' breakfast. Serena reached the doors to one of the training grounds. It wasn’t the training ground exclusive for staff, but rather the very same training ground she’d spent thousands of hours in when she was here all those years ago.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGU2OGQ5MGY0MjRhZjQ4MWY2NDJlNzZlOTNjOWQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the great doors creaked open, a wave of nostalgia washed over Serena. She felt a smile form on her face. She’d heard the creak of this door a thousand times, and now she was hearing it again. Stepping through, the first thing Serena noticed was the light snow falling. It wasn’t quite cold enough to settle on the sandy floor, but it gave the open-topped area an odd </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">silence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzQ4MjAwNzdkZjRmM2I5YmM4ZDg2MzI3OGQzODEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The second thing she noticed was that she wasn’t alone. Not more than a dozen meters away stood a woman practising vertical strikes. The demon was a fellow instructor, judging by her clothes and yellow belt. Yet, it wasn’t her uniform that caught Serena’s eyes. It was the woman’s ethereal beauty; a pair of perfectly symmetrical horns sprung from a bed of fiery auburn hair. Her features were sharp and despite being engrossed in her training with sweat on her face, the woman gave off an aura of femininity. Yellow aura danced across her skin, deflecting the falling flakes of snow. Her swordsmanship was unfamiliar to Serena, but even so, it could be considered </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">flawless. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">When the demon stopped moving, her position was picturesque, as if she was posing for a painting worthy of being hung in the finest halls of Cascadian nobility.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDJiNjQzYzI4YjRmY2U4MWI4NWI3ZTYzMzUzNmRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman didn’t react to Serena’s presence, appearing fully engrossed in her training. Serena wanted to stare, to stand there and watch the unbelievable talent of this woman. However, that would be rude. Serena forced herself to turn her attention away and sought a training sword. With the weapon in hand, she found herself a section of the sandy floor and began her pre-training warm-up.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmM4YTg5NzQzMDQ4MDdiMTY0NDcyNTgwMjVlYTA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena started with red aura and simple strikes, slashing vertically and horizontally while she got used to the weight of the wooden sword. Then, she began practising her parries. Slowly at first, before pushing herself into orange aura and increasing the ferocity of her movements. Elegant swordplay was always a treat to witness, but after her time as a squad commander, Serena quickly understood that it was raw, unyielding violence that won fights. She’d once seen a fellow commander, wreathed in orange aura, overwhelmed by a Republican officer with only red. The commander had all the technical skills from his time at the academy, but the battlefield was a harsh mistress, and experience made all the difference.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Nzc3MTExMGMzZDQ5MDBhYWFkNzkxMWE0YjY4NDNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Running her previous fights through her mind, Serena lost track of time as she practised. She fell into</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">a warrior’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">flow</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the state of mind where she could truly focus on the task at hand. The background melted away and Serena became aware of only her body and her sword. She began moving as one, with every move working alongside her breathing and heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzc5OTQ2OWIxZTRiNTBhMDg1ZDg3MDMyNzgzNDEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was until a strangely accented voice pierced through her concentration.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzAwMTMwMGY4MDQ5Zjg4YmJmOWQ3MDVmZjljYjI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your lead foot is moving,” said the voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDFkZGJkNDY3YjQ0MjJhMzZlZGI4Nzg0ZGVhZDk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena blinked, feeling the flow of her practice evaporate. Turning her head, she saw the mysterious woman watching her. Two purple eyes shone brilliantly, full of clarity and determination. The demon pointed towards Serena’s front foot. “You move it. Before you attack. Shall I demonstrate?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmFiNDM1N2UxYTQ5OTQ4NmYxNGM1YTVjNDlhZjhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman’s purple eyes and accented Imperial told Serena all she needed to know regarding her origins. Still, she wanted to verify it. If this woman was who Serena thought she was, then seeing her skills up close would be enough. “Demonstrate?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmU1MjlkM2Y4ODRhYWQ5Y2JmYWRjYmFjODZkMjQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” the northern woman said with a quick nod. She approached Serena until she was only a few meters away. Something about the woman put Serena on guard. Something about her triggered Serena’s instincts. The woman took an unusual stance, raising her sword high and slightly compressing her posture. It was a strange stance, unlike anything found in Serena’s arsenal. “Duel?” asked the woman. “You use </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimokan</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">; I use the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hawk</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjQ0NTMxOGM4ODRjZDJhODI4Y2EzNDkwZmMzODAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman didn’t seem to care for any pre-spar rituals, but Serena gave her a quick traditional bow anyway.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2M3MTQyODZhODRkYjhiZGRlZjdmNTRiZDBiMDQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d barely made her stance when the woman attacked. Quickly, Serena forced herself into yellow aura, barely keeping her guard from collapsing as the woman’s strike connected. Such strength! Her opponent wasted no time in flowing into another attack, bringing her sword against Serena’s defenses half a dozen times in under a second. On the sixth attack, Serena twisted her sword, parrying the incoming blade. The woman leapt back and Serena didn’t waste the opportunity to take control of the duel.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDM1NjMxYjZiMDQ4YTZhYjdjODE1N2Q4ZTkzMTE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There!” the woman suddenly called out, pointing towards Serena’s feet when she began to close distance. Serena bore forward, swinging her sword, but the woman had already begun dodging, quickly escaping Serena’s attack. Instead of chasing further, Serena reset her stance. Just in time as the woman resumed yet another assault that Serena frantically defended against. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGZjMTA5NTQzZjQ2YWZiM2NiNDAwZmUzMTUyYTEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman’s sword was elegant yet ferocious. The fact she maintained such control while bearing down upon Serena with the aggressive northern style, empowered by yellow aura, meant she was much further ahead than Serena when it came to raw skill. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDIxMDkzODkwODQ0MzM5N2QxYzZhYWFjMTc2ZWNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As a warrior progressed through the auras each strike, each movement, contained far more power than before. Such power meant fine control became difficult, and mistakes slipped through that the warrior wouldn’t make in the lower auras. As her opponent pointed out, Serena’s front foot shifted slightly before stepping forward. It was a tell that only happened when she was above red aura, but it was something that she needed to fix. At the speed and violence of an aura-powered fight, a small tell like that could mean death.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDQyMzk5MjE2MDQzMDdiZTNmNTdlYzE3M2NlZWQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you understand?” the northern demon said suddenly, stopping the duel and sheathing the wooden sword in her belt. Serena nodded, holding the gaze of the woman’s brilliant purple eyes for a moment too long before sheathing her own sword.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjIzODRjZjdmMjQ5OTg5NzcxZjY4N2YzNzA2OWM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Katalin of Driss, I presume?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2Y5NGJiOTQzYTQyMzc5ZGZlM2E2ZTI1ZTIxYmY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Katalin nodded solemnly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWYwYWE3Mjg0NDQ4MDFhOTRiMTM1Y2ViZDY5OWQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An honour to cross swords with you, Highlord Driss,” Serena said. Katalin of Driss was a Highlord in her own right, unlike Serena’s mother, who only held the title of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlady</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> due to her marriage to her father. Serena suspected Katalin wasn’t one to pick horns over Cascadian etiquette, and such thoughts were quickly validated.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTNkYWI3ODkxNjRjMTFiODlmM2IyZWI5OGJlNmVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instructor Driss, if you please.” Katalin tilted her head, looking into the distance as if she was choosing her following words carefully. “Instructor Halen?” Seeing Serena nod, Katalin continued, “The one with the human mage? The healer?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmIxZWFlMjJjZjQwOTU5ZGMwNmM5ZGVmZmYyOGJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assistant Instructor Thornheart, yes,” Serena clarified. The senior instructors she and Amelia encountered last night demonstrated an appropriate amount of respect. Whether their polite speech and gestures of etiquette were veiling a deeper level of resentment, only time would tell. It would most likely be the students, full of passion and zeal, who would be unable to control their bias and cause a scene.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2YwYmUxZTNiNzQ4M2ViMjNmMzRhYTRlMDdmNDQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, Driss was a northern city, close enough to be at risk of raiding by Republican ships. Their cityguard had been mobilised in the early stages of the war as the fanatics assaulted the Northern Terra Firma. The North continued to supply a disproportionate amount of manpower compared to the Centralis Basin and elsewhere. This proximity to the war meant it was likely Katalin of Driss was far more wary, and perhaps even suspicious, of Amelia than most.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGZlYjQ3ODdhZDQ2Y2NhZTQwMmVhNzNlMDBjYzQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s she like, this human? She’s learning the sword, no?” Katalin’s grip on her sheathed sword tightened ever so slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmIxZTI5OWQ0MzQyNjc5MzQxNDdiYTg2NzkyYTll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Really, she’s just an adorable idiot,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena wanted to protest.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzUyMDRkMzExMTQ5ZjhiYTNlMjA5MTkxODRiNzNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s…” Serena trailed off, trying to think how she should answer. This was Katalin of Driss, the famous swordmaster who thought of nothing but a blade and likely had less than a favourable opinion of humans. “Amelia isn’t a soldier. She’s motivated by the satisfaction of developing a new skill. She does not have the heart of a warrior.” </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">So don’t ask her for a duel,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena mentally added.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzgxMDM0NWMzOTRlZjE5NWQyZTk4ZjAzNjBjNzll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia? You two are close, then?” Katalin's eyes narrowed, her lips curving up slightly. It wasn’t a mocking smile, but it carried a flair of disapproval. “Strange… for a demon to be friends with a human Speaker. In Driss, we would call you a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">traitor</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> for such a thing, Instructor Halen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjNiNjUyNzE4ZDQ3YWFhZjQyNTIwODgxZTQwNmU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-” Serena began her protest, cursing at herself for casually slipping in Amelia’s first name.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzk4N2Y3Mjc2NzRkMTFhMDI4YjUwODU4YjVkN2Ri" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But we are not in the North, are we?” Katalin intoned. “Things are different here, yes?” She waved her hand dismissively, not waiting for an answer. “Enough about the human. What about you? You have reached blue aura, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDExZGUzOTQ3MDQyOGY5NGM5NTYyZjIyZDIzMWI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena nodded, glad to have moved on from the subject of Amelia. “You can tell, or has someone told you?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDQwZWExNWIyNDQyMTY4M2I4MTVkY2Q2NzIwYWM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Experience,” Katalin said plainly. “You are strong. Have you thought about communing another Word?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmUzMWQ1ZGM2ZDQyMzY4MWZmZDllZWUyOWNjY2I1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena had thought about such a thing, mainly as idle fantasies of her post-military career. Communing a Word required - amongst many things - an enormous amount of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">time</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Time dedicated to training. Serena’s previous tenure as a squad commander had been enough to allow her to Speak </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> for the first time. But </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was a demonic martial god who favoured honour and skill with the blade. Serena had long set her sights on </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as her target and she was, in a sense, lucky that the ferocious front-line battles she’d fought were enough to push her over the boundary.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTdmMDQxY2Q3OTQyMDc4YWEyMTBkMDA5NGIzYmNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But now, whether she was in the heat of battle or a ship’s captain, her duties did not allow her to spend the time required to build the foundation and understanding of another god’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">will</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to commune with them. A Word was a multi-year journey and for many a decadal one. It was not uncommon for a significant chunk of a person’s life to be spent seeking communion only to ultimately realise they had chosen the wrong god and wasted their effort.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTk1ZDhhM2IzMzQ2MzU4NzA4NzhkYTBjZTc0YjVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was part of the reason why both Korvus and she were considered prodigies. The younger a person was, the less they </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">knew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> themselves and the more difficult it was to commune. Serena, through the loss of her brother and her natural inclination towards pragmatism, developed a focused determination towards training that resonated with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and allowed the communion to form at a faster pace than usual.</span></p><span class="cmM4NDJhMjA1NjcyMTQ5ZmJhMWRiMjcyZWI4NTllYjIx"><br/>If you stumble upon this narrative on Amazon, it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNhMWIxOGEzNmE0MDQ4ZTRhYmFlN2UxZDA4OTRkN2Uy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now? Serena wasn’t sure if her mind was in the right place to begin building the foundations for a second communion. A particular bundle of smug energy had occupied a very large part of her life. Although she did not regret it for a moment, the presence of Amelia was causing changes in Serena’s personality and beliefs. As such, she would be in a poor position to seek another Word until she had a firm understanding of herself once again.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTgwZDVmNzQzYTQwMjlhZmI5Nzc3MTNmN2M1NzZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena shook her head. “I have considered it, but upon reflection, I have decided now is not the time.” Katalin simply nodded as if this was the response she was expecting.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmJjODNhYzI4NzQ1YmY5ZTVlZDA2NjI5YzhiYWU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because of the human, yes? Your mind has lost its focus.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmM4NDQ0ZDc5MzQ3OWI5NjUwMjM5MGNhMjg5NTdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your perception is admirable,” Serena said, avoiding answering the question directly with a compliment. Katalin of Driss was a dual-Speaker and if the rumours were to be believed, she was on the verge of a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">third</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> First Word. Her perception, boosted through two communions, no doubt exceeded Serena’s. “I also fear I simply don’t have the time, given my military duties.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODY4ZGM4YzcxNjQ5MmFhMzMzYTMxYzhlNjgwMTMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood,” Katalin said. A moment of silence passed before she opened her mouth and said, “If you did, what Word would you aim for?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjIwMjEzYzg0NjRhMTVhOWMyNGY0NzYzYjhlYjkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…” Serena hesitated. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Bayle</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was out of the question. The relentless brutality the unarmed martial god offered did resonate with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">some</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Serena’s personality, but the god was well known to be at odds with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Such a pairing would be doomed before it began.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmI5OTk1NDJhOTQ4NjRhZTc3ZTJjMDZjZjEyMDUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was also </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Salinas</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the demon god of earth. Before Serena found her true talent with the sword, she’d thought she might make quite the capable earth mage. While she only reached the first circle herself, that was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">good,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> considering she was training her martial arts simultaneously. Unfortunately, she was locked in with the martial gods - cross-communing disciplines was inefficient due to how the body adapted to how the mage or warrior used aether. Something that Amelia was struggling with herself despite her ridiculous talent.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTRhNmQ3MzdmMjRjYmJhMmVmZWVkZGMxMGRmZmY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This meant that the mage Word of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">the demon god of hellfire who rewarded passion, was out of the question. It also meant that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the demon god of storms, wasn’t viable. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was particularly powerful, and Serena still remembered the crackling energy of Lei Gong, the Greatlord of Kenhoro, who’d almost placed Amelia under house arrest if it weren’t for the interference of the Overlord.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzI2MjIyMzZhYjRmNjRiYTMzN2QwZWZkMWFmYzZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It would have to be another martial god. Of which two were the most likely. First was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">the divine sister of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was the demon god of protection, and those who communed with her were called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Paladins</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Serena remembered her fight against the mace-wielding paladin in the Kenhoro cafe. That woman was potentially associated with the darkblades, perhaps a wandering mercenary and Speaker-for-hire. Still, the unethical nature of that woman meant little to the gods. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> only cared if you possessed an unwavering determination to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">protect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">defend</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> something. What that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">something</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was mattered little.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGJhYmYxNjdhZTQ0YTBhYTliMjMwOTE1YzAzYTEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The second was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Longinus</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the demon god of the spear. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Longinus</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was the closest thing the demons had to a branch of divinity. It was the Word Greatlord Oshiro first communed and it was a requirement to be eligible to join the Empress’s famed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Guardians</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Longinus</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> respected faith, especially that of the Christian kind. Serena found Christianity and the Holy Demon Bible, which documented the life of the human-then-demon Christ, along with his holy heritage that was inherited by the Empress, to be the better faith for her, allowing her to worship the Empress more earnestly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTVhMDhjODc3MDQxNjk4M2ZjZTRkMWVlZmRjZmI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What aligned more with her personality? Did she prioritise defending Cascadia, acting as a bulwark against the dark forces that sought to destroy it? Or did she prefer to bring holy retribution to its enemies, with unquestionable loyalty and faith to Christ and his spiritual successor, the Empress Elana of Demonkind?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODIxNWQ2NjgxYTQ5OGQ5MzRlNGI1MGIxZDhmYTUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena sighed before communicating her two options and her reservations to Katalin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTA3MTVjZDVlOTQ4MzZhM2NiMGM1MDBlMzI2ZGU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is… a personal journey,” Katalin said after consideration. “If I may, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> would fit you better than </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Longinus</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, yes? The latter is far more challenging and requires…” Katalin mimicked a set of scales with her hands. “...A particular mindset. Pure devotion and loyalty. This is not an insult to you, Instructor Halen. I only mean to say the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Guardians</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> have a certain </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fanaticism</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> about them that was, with few exceptions, built up from childhood.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzIxNTZmMmU4YjQ4NzM4YTA3ZGY3ODY1MTc4Zjdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are those who Speak </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Longinus</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> who are not </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Guardians</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena pointed out. “Greatlord Oshiro, for example.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2YxZDU1NDcyMzRjNWNhM2ZlMjRhODg3ZWNkYWQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Katalin nodded. “But not the best fit. Greatlord Oshiro’s devotion was not, and is not, Christian. As a result, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Longinus</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> took him far longer than it should have. It was only his love of the spear that caused him to push through.” A bitter smile formed on Katalin's face. “He was lucky </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Izanami</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> favoured his skill, allowing his communion of a Second Word.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTAzYTU2N2ZmNDRlM2ZhOTE1ZGFmMjk3OGExYmY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena couldn’t help but frown at Katalin's words. Even if they were alone, the northern demon’s manner of speaking regarding the Greatlord was impolite at best. Some would consider her criticisms insulting. Serena bristled, keeping her voice controlled she asked, “You speak casually, Instructor Driss. As talented as you may be, do you think it wise to make such statements regarding the Greatlord? You act as if you know him better than he does himself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGZiYjhmYWEyMDQ4NWViNWZlMjJkMjIxNTc1N2Nm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin did not appear to take any offense at Serena’s statements. Instead, she only maintained her smile and said, “Do you know how I came to be a Highlord, Instructor Halen?” Katalin held Serena’s gaze. Through those purple eyes, Serena could barely sense how far beyond her own skills Katalin was. Had the northern demon truly only communed two First Words? She felt more like a Greatlord than a Highlord. It would not be unusual for a communion to remain a family secret.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Mjk1YmI3NmYxZTQyNjliZTI2MTA0MmU4ODJkMmY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do not,” Serena said plainly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGZiYTI1MmNmNDQwZGI4MzI4MDM1MTgyODAxZmZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course…” Katalin said. “Much of it has to do with my own skill with the sword. I admit my motivations are selfish; I seek to develop my sword above all else, understand? The main reason I came here was to experience </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimokan</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Yet, there is another. You see, I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">understand</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> people I fight, yes? Whenever my blade clashes with another, I gain insight into that person's nature. It’s a skill I’ve possessed as long as I’ve held a sword. If I hadn’t had myself checked by the demon Church, I would have thought it a blessing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDQ4N2M2MTY5MDQzOWFiZTFmZmQxNzllM2M5ZTQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What made me </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was my ability to guide promising talents onto the best pathway for them. I’ve volunteered this service only in the North until now, and there are more than a dozen Speakers on the front lines who have had their communion accelerated by my guidance. I am good at what I do, Instructor Halen. My family keeps tabs on promising Speakers Empire-wide and your name has come up more than once. Understand? Although you are not the primary reason I left the icy north, you were a motivation. So, accept my efforts and take my words to heart. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is the Word for you, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDI3NDcxMGZjZDRhMmNhOThhMjgyZjc5NmY4OWQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena stood still for a moment, and she felt a slight warming of her cheeks as pride surged from within. She may not have been the whole reason, but to think that the elusive </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin of Driss</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> sought </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">out! Regardless of anything else, it was, at the very least, a validation of her hard work so far. Serena promptly bowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjg3ZWY4YzRhNTQzOWI5YjM2NWU3YzhhMzM1ZjRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s an honour to receive your advice, Highlord. I will take it seriously.” Serena rose. “I take it this won’t be the last time we cross swords? I was informed you intend to teach an Instructors' class?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTQ5ZWM4MWQ5ZjRiNzdiYzcwYWZlMmVkMjUyZDJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is correct. You’re not the only Instructor here who needs guidance. I-” Katalin was cut off as the ringing of bells sounded throughout the academy. “Ah,” the northerner said once they subsided. “Now, the eager students will wake up. I will return to my other duties. I believe the Grandmaster has requested you and Assistant Instructor Thornheart’s presence, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDgzZjljZGY2ZTQ4YmRiNGVlYzkxMjI2YzkwNGU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena jumped, realising she was likely late. It wouldn’t do well for her first - or rather, second - impression as an instructor to be that of being late to a meeting. Thanking Katalin again, Serena returned her training sword and left the hall. As she made her way to the Grandmaster's office, tracing a route she remembered from years ago, she started to pass students and instructors who’d woken for early training or studying. The students gave her a look, noticing that she was a new instructor. A few recognised her, elbowing their friends and whispering about the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hellfire Captain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Serena ignored them and soon left them behind, navigating into the deeper corridors of the academy. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzZiZmM2YTg3ZTQzZWQ4YjljOTBjZjA4NDYwNmM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning a corner, she arrived at her destination, where she found Amelia yawning, leaning against the wall next to the office door. A student stood next to her that looked oddly familiar, but Serena couldn’t place where she’d seen them from.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDM3NGRkMmNmZjQ1NDJiNWFkOTc3ZjI5NWZjMGFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello!” Amelia waved. The student beside her jumped when she saw Serena but quickly looked down. “I thought we’d have time for breakfast,” Amelia continued. “I hope the Grandmaster’s going to be quick!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTA1MDFiYzJkMzQ5ZGJiZjhkY2ZlMjA4OWQ3MDlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning,” Serena intoned, stopping before the two women. “Who are you?” she asked the student directly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmIzM2RjZDViMjQ5ZWY4ZTZmZmE1NDNiZmQwMWEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm…” the girl mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWY2ZGE2MmUxZjQ2OTA5OTFjN2I1NzhhZWM3ZWE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is Mel!” Amelia chirped. “Remember? Back in Kenhoro, when we fought a duel, and her brother tried to kill me?” Amelia grinned happily when she said this but Serena did not miss the subtle groan coming out from Mel. Even if it weren’t her own actions, having someone in their family who lost their temper and tried to - unknowingly or not - cut down a Speaker would weigh heavily on whatever family Mel hailed from.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmM1NjcyNmJhNzRiMWNhNDRhODAyNjFhY2VhODI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I remember,” Serena answered. “Why is she here?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWFjYTU5MmU0MzQyYjNhZDE0MWMyZmM5MjIyYmMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She, well…” Amelia raised a finger to her chin before turning to Mel with a smile. “Mel, could you run along to breakfast ahead of us? Save us a seat, would you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDA3MzRmMTQ4MjRjNzVhZWYzMTA0MmQwZmRmMTc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I think Assistant Instructors and Instructors have their own tables, Assistant Instructor Thornheart,” Mel mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTFlMTM2MTBjZTRmN2NiMjY0MWU1ZTE3NTg1M2Fm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh?” Amelia blinked. “Well, come find me at lunchtime then! I’ll need someone to give me a tour of the academy. You can do that for me, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2I5OWVmMjJmODRhMzI5ZjNjODcwNGEzZjA0ZjM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel nodded, and with a quick bow to them, she hurried away and out of sight. Once she was gone, Serena raised a questioning eyebrow towards Amelia, who leaned in and said hushedly, “Turns out I get an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">assistant</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of my own! Isn’t that cool? None of the second-year students wanted to risk volunteering for the job. Even though I am a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wonderful </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker…” Amelia jabbed a thumb at herself. “They feared associating with a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> would do more harm than good for their careers and families. From what Mel told me, at some point, the Grandmaster here spoke to Grandpa Gu, and Mel’s name popped up!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWQxM2NkZDdiNzQ5OWNhMGFhZmNlOTNmY2RlYTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“After being healed, her personality and attitude did a complete flip. She turned away from her former friends and was getting bullied herself. Since she’d met me and had already been warned about keeping my abilities a secret directly by Grandpa Gu, she was offered to transfer down here. But get this! They </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">still </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">didn’t tell her she would be my assistant, only that she would be assisting a Speaker! Why would that be, hmm?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2U1NTJmZmI2ZjQ3ZGNhMzM3M2ZjNzIyYTViZjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena soaked in the information. “When was Mel offered this opportunity?” she asked. Upon hearing Amelia’s answer, her eyes grew wide. “That means all of this,” Serena said, waving a hand. “Chesterfield's plan, everything… It was all in the works while we were in Kenhoro. Seven hells, how fast was Intelligence working? That’s why Mel wasn’t told. Everything was kept as secret as possible until it was confirmed. Wait…” Serena felt her forehead furrow as a tinge of annoyance rose within her. “This means </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aiden</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> knew about this. He wasn’t just there to report on your personality, but he was scouting you out for Chesterfield’s ‘offer’. He was there when Mel was healed, right? It might have been him to put her name forward in the first place!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTAwZjcwYzlhODQ5M2JhYWI1NTJlNDA2OWYwOTBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Aiden Adachi was due to arrive shortly before the end of the semester. It was a shame he wasn’t here right now, for Serena would love to strangle him for some answers. For now, she’d have to do with squeezing her fists until the knuckles whitened. “When you next see him,” Serena instructed Amelia, “Put him in the ground again. We’ll make him squeal until he spills everything.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmUwZDEyNDEyNjQxZGViYjVhYTExMmE2MGMzZmI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded enthusiastically, grinning wildly. “I can’t wait!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTI0YmMxOTY3YTRkZjc5ZDczM2EwMDc5MGU2Nzkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a few minutes, they discussed their respective lodgings. Serena didn’t know why, but magic associations seemed to like building their research facilities as enormous towers. Amelia was on a higher floor, which, if Serena remembered correctly, was a sign of status and respect. Amelia hadn’t yet met Instructor Inoue but was supposed to meet with her after breakfast privately.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjdmMzFmM2M1NjRkNmI5MDdhYzlkOTJmMDE3MDVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember what Chesterfield said regarding Words,” Serena whispered. Just before leaving Shimashina, Chesterfield all but outright said that Centralis was aware that Amelia was capable of Speaking demonic Words. The man from Intelligence had implied very strongly that if Amelia Spoke one or even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">two</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> demonic First Words, it would assist the Cascadian Government with the political manoeuvring they’d begun to do regarding the human mage on the international stage. Serena couldn’t begin to guess at the breadth and depth of Cascadia’s plans, but one thing was obvious: if Amelia were known to be a demonic Speaker, it would make it all but impossible for Christdom to claim she was a lost or kidnapped saint.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzI1MWU3MDk0ZjQzMDlhZTRiZjMwNzQyZDc1N2U4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Amelia nod, Serena added, “Also, I just met </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin of Driss</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">; she’s as impressive as the rumours say. She didn’t seem </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> interested in you, but you’ll likely meet her sooner rather than later. She-” Serena was cut off as the door next to them slammed open, revealing a red-faced and growling Grandmaster.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjJjN2Y3YjUzNjQxZjY5YzAwMjY3NzY2ZTljMzI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn it!” the grandmaster snapped. “Are you going to stand outside my office and natter all day!? I’ve been waiting, damn you! Get in!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2NmYzQ4ZWQ2OTQ2MjdhMTc3YWUwYmIzNWMxZGU4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia squeaked at the sudden outburst, to which Serena only managed to stop herself laughing by biting her tongue and hiding her face by performing a deep bow. Not wasting any more time, they both darted into the Grandmaster's office, where he spent more than a few minutes dressing them both down.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNjNjYwMDM1YmYwMTQwMjBhNmZhNzMyNzdhMThhZjdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNhODYyYmE2N2RmOTQ0YmVhN2MzZmI2Y2NlYmY4YTQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After grumbling and complaining about their tardiness, Grandmaster Shun spent no less than half an hour drilling the pair of them about how they should conduct themselves around the students. Well, it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">seemed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> he was drilling the pair of them, but Amelia felt she was the target of most of his instructions and warnings.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjIwNmFlMmUyMTQzODhhMjU2ZTJhZjZlYTdjMDYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">From what Amelia could decipher, any trouble they caused would reflect badly onto him. As the head of a famous academy Empire-wide, where Cascadian nobility and other wealthy patrons sent their sons and daughters to receive the very pinnacle of military education, there were enormous expectations and pressures placed upon the staff to fulfill their roles flawlessly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWRlNGU0NDYwODRkNDM4ZmIzYWI4NzU2NTVjMzE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of them had additional warnings laid out. Most instructors were Speakers, and being Speakers, they not only represented the academy but also the class of society that was looked upon as being divinely chosen. The existence of a Speaker meant they measured up to the expectations of a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">god</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, and it wouldn’t do well for them to betray the significance of that. Furthermore, unlike most instructors, Serena was in active service, so her conduct reflected Eastern admiralty more than her colleagues' did.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzI2MjA4OWRiNTRkZWU5OTBjNTM0MTVlNzZlYjY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia, on the other hand, was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Not only was she human, but she was also the singular human on the academy grounds. Many of the students would have had limited contact with her race so her actions would be an essential experience for the trainee officers. Since she was a known Speaker, this effect would only be magnified.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjVkZTlhY2YxYzRiOTFhMjRhMmFmY2FhYWE4ODVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My brother informs me you’re talented beyond your years, Assistant Instructor Thornheart,” grunted the grandmaster. His gruff voice sounded oddly unfamiliar to Amelia’s ears as it was absent of the subtle Manwese accent she’d grown used to from Grandpa Gu. “As long as you don’t harm your fellow instructors or the students under your care, I suggest you don’t hold back that talent.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWFmNDllM2ZlZjQ4Njk4YTgwNjljOGUwNDRlY2Zk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?” asked Amelia, making a mental note to, despite the instruction, hold back quite significantly. She hadn’t been in her transformed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> form long enough to truly get a grip on her power, but in general, she figured her wards were as powerful as a native’s ward that was two, or even three, circles higher. First-circle wards could typically be expected to resist or outright defend against small-arms fire. However, Amelia’s casting of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni’s Barrier</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was more akin to a third-circle ward, only being breached by the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> terrifying tungsten penetrator rounds.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2Q4OGU1MzY0ZTQzNWVhODY3MDE4Y2RiMTEyMWZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because most of our students have grown up on the assumption that humans are weak,” the grandmaster explained, turning his palms outwards. “Which they are, of course. At least, if we compare your standard human soldier to their demon equivalent. We can carry more weight, run faster for longer distances and take more punishment on the battlefield. However,” the demon leaned back in his chair, closing his hands together. “That doesn’t matter much when aura and wards get involved. I don’t care how strong a soldier is. If they cannot manifest aura, they’ll lose against a human who can.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGViOTgyYzQ1ZDQwMGRhYmY4NmU5NGFiM2RiOTJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Most of our students don’t have the experience or the instincts to recognise the power a Speaker such as yourself holds, Assistant Instructor Thornheart. You being so young, as well as a human… and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">female</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” He sniffed, clicking his tongue. “Those highborn fools will look down on you. It’s one thing being told someone’s a Speaker, but another to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">experience</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it. If I remember,” he turned his head slightly, raising an eyebrow towards Serena. “You had your fair share of suitors thinking their orange could crack your yellow, didn't you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjg4MTU3OTc1NDRkNDE5MWJhMjY2ZDBhOWM4MjIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye,” answered Serena. “Took a few broken ribs and a couple of flattened noses, but they got the message eventually.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2ZlYmJlZGE1ODQ3MGZiMWE5Y2FlYmIzNTQ1NmYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The grandmaster raised a finger. “Communion only began a thousand years ago. Men’s instincts are far older. Despite being </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">told</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> they couldn’t possibly measure up to you, a Speaker, they will </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">feel</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> they can. As I said, don’t be afraid to show your talent. I believe Instructor Inoue plans to have you duel some of the troublemakers in her class. It might be worth putting you against some of our more ambitious warriors as well. Some of them think just because their orange aura is turning a little yellow they can challenge a Speaker.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGEwMzRmM2I1ZDRmMjQ4NWIzMzg1ZGNhMzJiOTg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood, Grandmaster. Don’t hold back.” Amelia nodded her head, affirming the instruction.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTY3NmMzN2FmNjRkMjk4NjYwMTBjOTY0ODc2ODNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Must hold back,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she thought to herself. Turning her head, she saw Serena’s expression. Judging by the slight wrinkling of her brow and tension in her jaw, her girlfriend was thinking the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjdiY2JiOTFjNzRmM2JiNzI4MmY3ZTMzZTFmZmI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a few more nuggets of advice from the demon, they were dismissed. In the hallway, Amelia faced Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWUwYzE2OGU5NjQxMzM5NjM3YjRiNzY1NjlkNTBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Breakfast?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWQ0NGFkYzliMDQ3ZjNhZWM5Y2ZiYmQwMTIwOWFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Breakfast.” Serena nodded. “Follow me,” she began, leading Amelia through the corridors. “Remember, don’t sit with the students. Even if you think it’ll help demon-human relations, it’s better to maintain a certain distance from those who you’ll be teaching. If you get too close, it’ll create… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">complications</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmJjZjQ0ODFmZjRmNzg4ZmM3ODY4MmUyYzgwN2U3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As they got closer to their destination, more and more students appeared. Many of them saluted Serena earnestly, only for their expressions of admiration and respect to turn into shock and surprise as they saw a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> instructor. They then spread their confusion to their friends as they gossiped, perhaps not knowing Amelia could easily make out their hushed whispers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDJlNjkyZDcwMDQ5ZjFiMDgxMTI1ODM3NjdmY2Ri" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A human? Here?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjVkZjUyMTcyMzQ0OWI5YmE2ODkzMGJlMGVjYTQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s dressed like an instructor. Yellow belt…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjVlOGJjNDE4ZjRkYzY5MzFiNjIwMDcxODRiNjk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Father told me about her. That’s Amelia Thornheart. They said she…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDRmMjJhNjBmNjQ4NDNiM2ZiOGY3NWVjNDc3YjU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you catch her eyes? They looked as red as a highborn demon! Is that normal for humans?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmRlNGJlOWMxMTRjNGJiMDU0YzAxOGIyMmIxMzlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Doing her best to ignore them, Amelia and Serena stepped into the breakfast hall. Of all the things she expected, she didn’t expect to see such an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">orderly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> system in operation. Perhaps her expectations were tainted from her experience of serving lunch on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, where she had to practically fight off hordes of ravenous demons climbing over each other to be the first to bribe her for an extra piece of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sardis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTIwNmEzYjNjNDRkODg5NmFmOGMxODBkNjVlNGNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Here, everyone neatly lined up with a tray in hand, going past several food stations where they could freely pile their plates with a selection of vegetables, fruits, meats and sauces. Feeling a little self-conscious, Amelia stuck close to Serena, not paying that much attention to what she was putting onto her plate. Thankfully, Instructors and Assistant Instructors had their own set of tables on a raised platform above the students.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjk2ZGNlOTJjYjQxMDI5NDUzODgwOGYwNzNiZTM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Approaching the Instructors' area, they were waved towards a pair of open seats by familiar faces that had welcomed them last night. Amelia sat next to Instructor Kawas, the mage who’d guided them through the pouring rain and mud. Whether it was her nature or she was making a special effort for Amelia, Kawas was rather chatty, making comforting small talk. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWM4YzZkN2RlNzRhMWI5ZDkwZGU0MTg5NWVhM2U4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Across the table, Emalina Honda, the head of the Department of Medical and Battlefield Care, kept jumping into the conversation, poking and prodding at Amelia’s healing capabilities. The senior instructor didn’t seem to fully believe Amelia when Amelia responded that yes, she could grow back a lost limb. Amelia eventually shrugged and told the woman if she wanted proof, she could chop off a limb here and now, and Amelia would happily demonstrate. That earned her a few chuckles from the other instructors, most notably Ryosuke Yamamoto, the Head Instructor of Leadership and Ethics.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGNlMGFjOTZjMzQxNzQ5MWYwNWJkN2VjN2UzNWNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don't doubt her, Emalina,” Instructor Yamamoto said, wagging a finger. “I once took the sword arm of a human Speaker, only to find myself crossing blades with him the following week. Guess what? Whole new arm! Rather unfair, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2U1NTgxODEzMjRhZWI4NzFjNGM4MDlhNTg4YWQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around, Amelia couldn’t see any instructor fitting the description Serena had given of Katalin of Driss. She did, however, see Mel across the hall. The young demon was in a quiet discussion with other students. At least she seemed to have found some friends. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGY0NGFhMTQ3MTQ3YmRiMzc0YTZhMWVmNTBlZmI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where is Katalin of Driss?” Amelia asked the table. “I’ve looked forward to meeting her. Grandpa, uh, Grandmaster Gu from the Kenhoro Academy spoke highly of her.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmJmYzc0ZDE2MzQyMTdhOTUxYjIyNDlkMWJkZjQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The elusive swordmaster eludes our company,” Sarafina Nakajima, the Head Instructor of Intelligence and Security, intoned softly. “She’s probably training right now. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her eat in the two weeks she’s been here. She’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">quite</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the enigma…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzI1NGNhZmMzNDQ3MDNiMTMyMGJiNGY1YzJlMWEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I met her this morning,” Serena said between mouthfuls. “She’s as skilled as the stories say. I fear I would be helpless if she got serious.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjM0YjVlNTc1NzRiMjRiMWQ3ODNhMGQzNDRmNmJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor Yamamoto nodded. “That’s how I felt as well. My spear couldn’t reach her. She offers a group training session every Wednesday and Saturday at first light. For Instructors only. About two dozen of us go. I expect you’ll be making an appearance, Instructor Halen?” Seeing Serena nod, the man turned his attention to Amelia. “I’ll be very interested to see how she teaches you, Assistant Instructor Thornheart. I’m sure we’ll see you there if there are no conflicts with whatever Lunaria demands of you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzcyMWY0NjRlYjQzNjE5NTlhMmQzZjY4YWY2ZTQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of Lunaria Inoue, the instructor whom Amelia was supposed to work under was absent. When Amelia asked about her whereabouts, she was informed the Instructor was a bit of an oddball, often so focused on her magic or aether experiments she forgot to eat. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzA5YmU3OGZjNTRlZDc4Y2I5ZWRhYTk3ZTM2OGIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s been a bit… erratic recently,” Instructor Honda said thoughtfully. “Think she’s excited about you, Assistant Instructor Thornheart. Having a human subject- sorry, a human </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to experiment, I mean, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">practice</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> on must, uh…” the woman trailed off.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTU4ODAwYzdmZjQ3MjVhNGU4NDQ4OGM3ZjQwMGZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh dear…” Instructor Nakajima raised a hand to her mouth, giggling.</span></p><span class="cjA4YzFkZDkzZjYyMjRjNjFiNDI5NWRmYzUyY2MwNzE5"><br/>Stolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkYzZlMzg4MWZkZjRjODA5ZDk2NWFjOWI4ODAyMzI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What Instructor Honda is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">trying</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to say,” Instructor Yamamoto said, “Is that Lunaria is a bit single-minded regarding magic. Some of her colleagues call her the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aether Addict</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, given her relentless focus on harnessing greater and greater amounts of aether, both for herself and her experiments. She’s rather friendly, all things considered.” He shrugged before continuing with his meal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzk0YmJmZjg2MjQyMDFhMzRiMzMyY2NkMmMxOGIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aether Addict</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. How nostalgic! It was the same nickname Amelia’s guildmates gave her from the game, earned through Amelia’s relentless grinding of stats and achievements, all to max out her aether capacity and regeneration. If the elusive Instructor Inoue possessed the very same nickname, then perhaps they would get on just fine.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmRjZTFiMmZkMjQyZWI5MWI0YWI4YjNlNzNjNTVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Breakfast continued and Amelia continued to chat away with the instructors. Some were a little wary at first, but after she put extra effort into her smiles, they opened up. After some time, a broadsheet was passed around the table, eliciting chuckles from those who read it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjI0YjA4ODgyOTRhOWQ4NWIyM2JiYThlNjg4ZjYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You and your big mouth…” muttered Serena upon reading the headline. “Look at you, you’re famous now.” She passed the papers to Amelia. “Here, read it out loud for us.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTYxMTQzMDI1YzRkMGU5YzFjZDRkNDVmNjJmZmE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Written in block capitals across the top of the paper was a familiar quote: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I LOVE DEMONS</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Underneath, her face was plastered in black and white, taking up most of the page. It was one of the photographs taken while she was waving outside the carriage the previous morning. Cringing slightly at the headline, Amelia skimmed the first few sentences of the front-page article.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTA3OGQ3MjE3MTRlZjQ5ZWUzNjRkZjA1MDhkNzk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The mysterious Amelia Thornheart, recently sanctioned as Lord-Prospect, offered little conversation upon stepping upon Asamaywa soil. However, as her carriage raced away from our journalists, she offered one definitive answer…” Amelia read out loud quietly, feeling a groan forming in her stomach. “...her radiant golden hair and highborn crimson eyes left many onlookers stunned at the human’s natural beauty…” the groan was making its way up her throat. “One young and ambitious demon, perhaps overwhelmed by the sight of the enchanting Speaker, loudly declared he would marry the human, before fainting- ahh!” The groan manifested, and Amelia crumpled the paper into a tight ball.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGE2ZDNlNmFiMTQxZmJhMWNhMjY2OWJmMmRkMTg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her actions caused the table of Instructors to laugh, loud enough that many students glanced their way. Amelia saw Serena red-faced as her girlfriend tried to stifle a laugh. Their eyes met, and Amelia’s attempt at a disapproving glare had the opposite effect as Serena burst out laughing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjFkMmE1NTAxMDQyMDZhYWU2MzRkNDJhYjFlNDc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you not to answer any questions,” Serena said, wiping tears from her eyes. “The hacks </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">love</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> getting statements from Speakers. You’re lucky they went for that approach. They’re trying to stroke your horns, see if you’ll open up for an interview. Which…” Serena leant in with a sparkle in her eye. “...I suggest you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">don’t</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> do. Unless you want half of Asamaywa at your door, fighting to propose!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Yjc2M2NhMWEwNzRmMmVhZTg0ZTk1YTUxMjQ5MWRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia rolled her eyes as the table giggled again.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDZmZTUzZWJjNzRlZjk5YjQ5ZDM5NTE2ZjliNjJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">These idiot demons!</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGRhYjE0ZjIwOTRjMWE4NzhlMzg2ZDVkOTlmNGFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She finished her breakfast and she and Serena prepared to leave. Instructor Kawas told Amelia where she was most likely to find her superior, Instructor Inoue. Instructor Kawas offered to guide her, but Serena raised a hand, stating she would take her. The pair left the breakfast hall to more hushed gossip from the students.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTgzZDIzYjUzYzRlNDBhMDU0ZDljZmE0MjRjZmY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you know anything about this ‘Instructor Inoue’?” Amelia asked as they navigated the twisting corridors of the academy. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWVhZDI4MjE0NTQ1OTliZDA5OTUwM2JmYzk1ZjEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I haven’t met her personally,” Serena answered, “But the name rings a bell. Nina’s worked with her before in Centralis. Who knows, perhaps you’ll be able to make use of your mathematics here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2RjYjRhM2VjZDRkMGY4ZTFlNzRhZjQ5Y2E5MDcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was an idea! Amelia had formally studied mathematics in her old world, where the field was centuries ahead compared to here. While the demons had discovered calculus, it was still in its early stages. Amelia was sure she could at least scratch out a few dozen mathematical proofs of the more advanced topics. Even if she couldn’t remember them perfectly, she knew enough to point the mathematicians of this world in the right direction.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTgzZDYzZDgyMzRlYWFiY2MwZjNjZDAyYjg4NTBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here we are,” Serena said. “Speaker Room Two.” She tapped the heavy wooden door before pointing to an insignia hanging from a peg. “That’s House Inoue’s insignia. Instructors place their house’s insignia, or instructor's badge if they don’t have a noble house, onto the pegs. It’s a quick way of saying, ‘Don’t come in unless you have business with me’. Want me to come in with you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzBkM2FlMWUzMzRlY2M5NTkyOTM3YTAzMGJiMWFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia shook her head. As she became more comfortable being in demon society, she felt more and more confident in tackling new things by herself. She didn’t want to rely on Serena for more than she had to. “I’ll be fine,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmU2ZTAwODY2NzQxNmNhYzRlZjA1YmMyYWMzZTVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you’ll</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> be fine,” Serena replied, tapping her foot and crossing her arms. “I’m more worried about Instructor Inoue. These Speaker Rooms are enchanted. Their walls are strengthened using the ancient art of Writing. They may be designed to be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker-proof</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, but that doesn’t mean they’re </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia-proof</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Try not to blow the academy up, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTZlMjlhZjk0YjQ4YjFiMzQwNzZlNTNlZjUwMzVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia puffed up her cheeks but had to quickly unpuff them as some students appeared around the corner. Rolling her eyes, she reassured Serena she would do her best not to destroy the Asamaywa Academy. Not wanting to be lectured further, Amelia pushed open the door and stepped inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGVkOTFiNjVjYzQ5MTViNDM5ZmY1MzJkZWQ0Zjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing her senses picked up was the tremendous amount of aether the woman inside was churning through her body. The demon was hovering in the centre of the large room, pulsing her aether against the floor. It could be none other than Instructor Inoue. At first glance, she appeared to be a relatively young woman, perhaps thirty years old. However, something was off about her appearance and with a bit of focus, Amelia’s perception saw through the glamour, revealing the much older demon beyond.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTYwMzkzNjA2YTQ2Yjk4ZTljNmQwYmQ5ZjJkMDQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice glamour,” Amelia complimented. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaxai </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">would be proud.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGQ1NTExMWY0YzQ3NWFiZDkyNzZlNDU1ZTBmZjJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Merely practice,” Inoue replied. “Foolish is the woman who clings to her lost beauty.” The mage turned and peered at Amelia, who couldn’t help but reflexively flare her cloaking spells. “However, you appear to be the age you look. How old are you, human?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTFmY2ZmYzUyZTRjMjBiNGJlZjdhNTFlNzUzNWU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Twenty-five,” Amelia answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWM0ZDM0NDI5NTQ2OGY4ZDVjNWQ2MDMxZjI4OGI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So they say.” Inoue’s aether hummed, and the woman gently lowered herself. The amount of aether flowing through her made Amelia suspect she was perhaps the second most capable mage she’d encountered in this world, behind only the Eastern Overlord.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzk2ZWFiZjRkNzQ3MTA5NDBlNjZmNjExOWFjMTgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And herself, of course.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWQzZTM3OWI0NjRkMDg4Y2M0OGMwMTQwOWU1YmI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if that’s true,” Inoue murmured. “Or does your healing slow, or even reverse your ageing?” The demon seemed lost in thought for a moment before suddenly exclaiming, “Well! Come over here then. Can’t get a proper look at you if you hide by the doorway!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjM5NGJkZTQwYzRlYzc5MGYxOTBjZjIxYWY1ODc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” Amelia ensured the door was firmly shut before walking towards the senior instructor. As she did, Amelia took in her surroundings. The room was enormous and spacious. It was like a giant, empty warehouse. There were no windows. The room would be pitch black if it weren’t for a few dim aetherlights. The floor, walls and ceiling were covered in a dark sponge-like material. Behind this material, Amelia could sense distortions in the aetherfield that formed repeating patterns everywhere she looked. She’d never seen the ancient </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Writing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena had talked about. The humans had somehow inscribed the runic script upon the torpedo that struck the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">allowing it to do so much damage. It was one of many subjects Amelia planned to investigate while spending a semester at the academy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmN2M0ZTRiYWMyNjQ2MzQ5YTdjNWJiMmFlM2MxOTI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Inoue tilted her head slightly as Amelia stood before her. “Impressive. Very impressive. I see potential. Excellent aether reserves. You’re cloaking yourself, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjM1ZjczNDdmMzQ4ZjY5YmY2NWUzNTRiOTc5MjVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded. At all times, Amelia maintained several cloaking spells to hide her true power. After returning from Speaking the Second Word, she’d found her body was able to process truly titanic amounts of aether, even without Speaking. The more she used aether, the more her new body seemed to adapt and become even more efficient at moving the stuff around. Her cloaking was getting better by the day, but some still leaked through. As far as she could tell, she presented as an above average Speaker to most mages or warriors observing her. However, more powerful people, like Grandpa Gu or Greatlord Oshiro, seemed like they could perceive through her cloaking magic and catch a glimpse of her actual capabilities.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWJmYmNmNTM2YzRjYzE4NjdkZGJmZTA2OWQ5ZWM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The question was, how much could Instructor Inoue see?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjEyMzMzNWNhNTRjYzI4NDU4NDM1MGNhNmRkZGRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good, good…” Inoue tapped her foot on the spongy floor. “And wards? I can sense at least one on you. Something from </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">right? There’s more…” The aged mage leaned forward, peering at Amelia in a manner some might call offputting. Amelia had the odd sensation of being studied and examined like a creature in a science experiment. “You’ve got demon wards on you, is that right? I can smell </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> on you. How unusual for a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to dabble in demonic spellwork.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzhhN2VhNzRiMjQ0NzA4NWRlYjdkNTY4ZGFkNzlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">More than dabble,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGJkOGM0Y2NkMDRiYzg4ZmE2M2FjZWNkNGIzOGMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well,” Inoue said, straightening up. “If you’re maintaining that many wards and that many cloaks, then your aether will be fit for the job. Although…” the demon brought a fist to her mouth, lightly coughing. “You wouldn’t mind me </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">verifying</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it, would you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTE4MGU3MzgyZDQ2NmZhNTY1ODc4MTI2Y2YzMjhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Verify?” Amelia questioned, feeling a subtle tension form in the air.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGZlYzg2MjNjZTRjZDhhZWJmOGFiMmRmZTA3YWI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just a little duel, if you please, young Assitant Instructor Thornheart. Would you be amenable to that? These walls are built to withstand bursts of aether. I daresay you can </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">flare</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as much as you please.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2Y5M2JkOWM2ZDQ2OTM5M2IxYmVlMWU2NDNhZWNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you… sure?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDY0M2VhN2VhODQzZjZhMWI4NTg3N2NkYjkwYWM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that a yes?” The instructor’s voice took on a note of eagerness. Hopefully, this mage wasn’t some kind of battle maniac. Amelia did a quick mental check of her wards. She was extremely confident in their strength, but even so, Inoue would likely be the most skilled opponent she would have faced so far.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Yzg5OTVjMWFjNjRiZDc5ZWQ2YTI0M2ZjMGZmMTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, we can duel,” Amelia replied. She figured that even if she was utterly out-skilled and her natural affinity failed her, she could simply tank whatever Instructor Inoue could throw at her until the woman was bored or exhausted.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTdmZWQ1MjU2YzQ5ZDI4ZWQwNjMxZjA5ZTY2NzMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How eager!” Inoue broke into a broad smile, stepping forward and reaching out her hand. “Where are my manners? I’m Lunaria Inoue, Lord of House Inoue and Head Instructor of the Department of Aether! It’s a pleasure to meet and work with you, Assistant Instructor Thornheart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGQ1ZDZjYmFkZjQ2MTA5NGE3MjdlNGMzZDUzZWUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Call me Amelia,” Amelia said, taking Lunaria’s hand into a handshake. Amelia wondered if this demon was from Centralis, as shaking hands was typically less common in the East.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTQyOTc3ZDZkOTQ0ZWViMzQ4NmMyNjY0MGUxYWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then call me Lunaria. Are you sure you’re ready to start, Amelia?” Inoue asked, not releasing her grip on Amelia’s hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjlmYjBjNDgyNzQ2NmJiMWUwOTgzNTYzMmZlZTIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m ready,” Amelia answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzg3ZWY2OGMzMDRiZDI5ODFhZWM0M2UzOTA1YWVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Truly?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzgwMjI3NTBlNTRjMThiOTZkY2VjYWRmYjY5Zjlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Truly.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzhiMjU0NDY2MTQ0NjA5OTYxYjM1N2RhMmRlODdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Charming,” Inoue said, her face wrinkling in mirth. “Then, if you don’t mind…” her aether frothed and churned, forming into a familiar structure.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmNiZmEwMjQ3ZTQyMTc5ZjQ4OWIyYWIxM2RhNjk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A Word.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTE5NGEzYTU3NjQ3MGM5MGUzODU0YjU2MzZjZjYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong><em>Igni</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”,</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spoke the demon, blasting everything in her surroundings, including Amelia, away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWM2NTcxYWU5ZTQ4YjRhNDZmNWI4Yjc5ZjQwMWI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia flared her aether, forcing her to slow down before slamming into the wall. As she came to a stop, she formed her own Word, wrapping the ethereal substance into the required shape.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWExOTNiNmIzNTRlZDNiNWZjNzNmMDk4YWU5YmRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She had permission to use the demonic Words now. The very same Words she’d spent thousands of hours using in the hospital. The ones that earned her the title of Dreadmage Thornheart. Amelia knew she could probably only Speak no more than two First Words, lest she cause more problems on the political stage.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTNkZDMzZmFmMjQ1ZTlhNGJlNDk3Nzc4YWNiZTYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she had to pick carefully. The choice was obvious. Why not start with her most reliable Word? The one she’d by far spent the most time with playing the game. She couldn’t help feeling a grin creep up her face. She might not be a soldier, but this was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thrilling</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGRhNmUwZmEwYzRmYWQ5YWI4MzIwNWFmYTk3ZDk3" style="margin-bottom: 6em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong><em>Taranis</em></strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">she Spoke, invoking the demon god of storms</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMzOWNhMDY1NmZjMDQxYzg5NTU3NjY4MTU1ZjkzNjU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGFiNTY2MjU0MTRhODk5ZDM3NmNlMGZiMjg1NDgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the sensation of her entire body taking an exhilarating cold breath, divine aether flowed in and through Amelia’s body. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Power</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Since Lunaria had been so kind as to blast Amelia away with her invocation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Amelia thought it was fair that she returned the favour.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzBkYjM5MmQxMDQwZDVhZjQ5ZTgyMjMyNjBkNWE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t quite know exactly how strong the surrounding Writing-enforced walls were. Still, her intuition told her that if she maximised the amount of atmospheric aether to be expelled by the incoming god-given aether, the resulting explosion would cause the newly formed House Thornheart to be given a devastatingly expensive repair bill.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2ZiNWYwNGIwNzQ5NGQ5ZTRjOTM3ZjVhYWQ3OGEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">So she made sure to cycle the aether and expel it beforehand. Well, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">most</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of it. She left a fraction in as a tentative test of her aether capacity and to repay Lunaria’s bold opening move. Hopefully, with even such a small amount of her monstrous aether reserves, the effect would still be magnificent.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjVmMjkxNGNhMDQ3MGRhNDcyYjJhNDhiZTgyNzNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia wasn’t disappointed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGY3NjAzNzA4YzRhOGZhYjMyNDQwMThlMTJlYjVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The explosion of aether-infused lightning flooded the room with crackling energy, smashing apart the hellfire Lunaria was already sending her way and deafening Amelia with the noise of a thousand lightning bolts that outdid any barrage of shellfire landing near her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWUxM2RmMDZlNzQzN2M4M2JmZDliOWQ5MTUyNDc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t just a thousand bolts of destruction; every streak of lightning gave Amelia tactile feedback of their surroundings and what they slammed into. All at once, she could feel the excitement of the air as it hummed with energy. She could feel through a thousand arms the spongy - now charred - material that lined the room. She could feel the odd sensation of her aether colliding with Lunaria’s wards. From the perspective of her energetic children, punching through the instructor’s wards was like trying to push through an ever-thickening invisible wall. The weaker barrier collapsed immediately, but the stronger ones felt like a mountain of thick, oozing mud that sought to envelop and suffocate any attacking aether.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTQ4ZjYwYTQ4YjQzZTc5NmIwNzk4M2QwYTAxMzNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Other than that, Amelia felt fundamentally </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">changed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. When Serena Spoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her horns became wreathed in hellfire, and she gained a tail of the same magical element. Amelia had been hopeful for a majestic transformation, and she wasn’t let down!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDY5Y2VhOTAyOTRjOGU5MjY4OGRiMDZkYmE1M2Vh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Horns.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzYxZjhjNmFjNDQyOWQ4ZTI0YWU4MGJmYTI1MTgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">horns</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Not of the physical variety, of course. They were made from the same aether-infused lightning that was Taranis's calling card. Unlike the bolts that whipped out to strike like a venomous snake, her horns were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">dense</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and maintained their form. Tightly wrapped and glowing blue, they protruded from her head, curving to form a set of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> familiar horns.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2YzMjFkYjMzZjQ3NmY4MGNlZTZhYWVkMjM4MmY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena wouldn’t mind, would she?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWNlNzNhMGYwNDQxNGY5MTIxZTgzZjYwNjljOGUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sparks of energy snapped between their tips, reminding Amelia of two tesla towers. Just like her lightning bolts, Amelia’s horns were more than just aesthetic. They were a new set of sensory organs, attuning her closer than she ever had been - apart from her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> transformation - to the aetherfield.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2I1ZGI3MDAwMzRjZmJiMzIyOTllZDc4NDYwNTBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her resplendent set of horns wasn’t the only change. Layered over her fingers were two sets of ghostly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">claws</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that crackled with energy. They weren’t extruding from her fingertips or knuckles but sat about an inch above her digits. Moving her hands experimentally, she noted that the two lightning claws moved perfectly in sync with her actual body. Strange. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was not a melee-orientated Word. Why had her invocation given her a set of claws?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTFjYWFmYmQ1ZTRjZjA4NDhiOGU3ODg1MmFmM2Yy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re quite done examining your own body…” A voice heavy with fiery power interrupted Amelia’s self-reflection. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2E0MWU3N2EwMDQ3ZDRiZWFjYzBhZjg2ZGM5Zjhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A beam of superheated lava rocketed towards her, catching her off guard, slamming into her side and spinning her around. If it weren’t for her heightened sense of the surrounding space and her position within it, Amelia would have been wholly disorientated. The white-hot beam curved, giving chase. Amelia cycled her aether, sending a compressed bolt to destroy it, only for the beam to split into a dozen smaller attacks that attempted to strike her from all angles.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGNhNGM0NjJiZjQxZjBhOGU1MDc1ODljNDZiYWFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As a precaution, she wrapped her lightning around herself, forming the powerful fifth circle ward, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis’s Cloudguard</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. From the feeling of the aetherfield, Lunaria had wrapped herself with the equally strong protection, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni’s Hellshield</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmE3YmJhYmIyZDQ5MGE4MjE3YWFmYjYyYWQ2MTkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, it was equally as strong as long as Amelia kept limiting herself to a small fraction of the titanic amount of aether she could potentially channel. This duel was a perfect opportunity for her to explore what was an appropriate amount of power to show. She wanted to show off, to an extent, to ward away potential enemies of herself and Serena. Still, she didn’t want to display capabilities that would </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">terrify</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> people and necessitate her to withdraw from society.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjNiNmQyNDEzMDQ1ODBhNzAyNzY5OWI2Yjk3MTQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria’s attacks continued in a frenzy. Amelia tried her hand at dodging. She flared her aether repeatedly, propelling herself around the room while her lightning struck out at the instructor who also did her best to avoid the incoming attacks. Lunaria seemed to move in a far more experienced manner, her invocation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> had provided the instructor wings of hellfire. Amelia wasn't sure whether these burning wings helped the instructor move around the room or if they were just aesthetic.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTc4NjY5NzdmMzRjYmZiZWM5NGI3YmRhODVmOTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Such power!” Lunaria exclaimed. “Such talent!” The aged woman grinned as if she’d discovered a new favourite toy. “I feel like I’m fighting Lei Gong, the Stormlord himself! Tell me…” Lunaria paused her speech to form another spell. A dozen balls of hellfire manifested next to her and launched themselves one by one at Amelia, each one causing a tremendous explosion that set the room shuddering as they impacted Amelia’s wards or the surrounding walls. “...You cannot truly be twenty-five, can you? Such power is impossible for a human so young! Unless… no… could it be?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWQ0YWViMDkzYzQ3ZDk4OTgxOWE3NTRhMzE4OTE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a blessing, and I’m not a darkblade!” Amelia said cheerfully, dodging another round of fireballs and superheated beams. “I’m just me, Amelia!” As soon as she said it, she regretted getting caught up in the moment. Perhaps it would be best to hint that she did possess a blessing. She didn’t want to draw too much attention to herself, but then again, given the journalists she’d already encountered, she figured the cat was out of the bag and she’d do better to try and adapt to her new celebrity status.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODIwZTlkMzgwZDRhOTBiZDdlZTBhMmFjYjA2MTY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The back and forth continued as godly amounts of aether saturated the room's atmosphere. Lunaria launched beam after beam at Amelia, who responded in kind with her own compressed bolts of lightning. Larger and larger fireballs manifested as Lunaria spooled up greater and greater amounts of aether.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGQ2MTgwYzQxYTQ1Njk5MDI3NzBhMjljNGQxNmNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia took the opportunity to explore the variety of spellwork she remembered from the game. She was delighted to discover she could manifest </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis’s Cloudburst</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, a devastating fourth circle chain-reacting area-of-effect attack that was her bread and butter for grinding countless achievements in the game. Seven enormous ball-lightnings sprung from her, darting to random locations before each exploding into seven more balls, which each then detonated into even more balls. This process repeated until the room was thick with lethal lightning, charring the last bit of wall and ceiling that had escaped the combat so far. Lunaria was forced to focus on her defense, ceasing her attacks and flaring her aether to reinforce </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni’s Hellshield</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTA1YTQ5N2JmNzRjNWI4ZDQxYWY3YWMxMjNjYmFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The attack ripped into the ward, tearing away chunks as it sought to breach the fifth circle defense. For a moment, Amelia feared she would break through, although such concerns were not shared by her opponent.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzZmNmRkZjNhMzRjZTFhMDAxZmU5NDU4ZjY4NDAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Invigorating!” The instructor exclaimed. “More! Finally, someone who can match my aether!” Lunaria’s brow creased in concentration and even more aether was funnelled through her body, distorting the aetherfield as she formed and cast her next spell.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDU4YmZkNzhiYzQ0MjA4M2Q3YzM0MTI0NDJlOTRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, a thousand threads of razor-thin hellfire spawned in the room. Amelia halted her movement lest she slam into the unfamiliar spell. A thousand threads intersected the three-dimensional space in every direction, crossing and crisscrossing each other to form a chaotic wall of tripwires. Each one was formed from more aether than the largest fireballs Lunaria had launched.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjM3YWY3ZjViOTQyMzU5MzhlNzI5YzQwMzgxMDY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What spell is this!?” Amelia shouted, feeling herself becoming a little lost in the excitement. This was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">new</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Not everything about the magic of this world was reflected in the game she’d played.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTE5OWM0NDhmODQ0ODA4Nzc1MTc3NTBjNzVhZWQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha…” Lunaria breathed heavily, her breath misting with raw aether. It seemed the casting of this new spell took a toll on the academy’s famed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aether Addict</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. “I suppose you might not recognise… you are human after all…” She turned to look directly at Amelia, her eyes glowing with power. “It is the pinnacle of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a sixth circle spell first communed by the desert Greatlords centuries ago! Now, let’s see how you handle it!” Lunaria roared, flexing her aether as three dense beams of superheated lava erupted from her, homing in on Amelia’s position.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzcxZGE0MTAzMTRlOTI5ODQ1NWFhNjRjNjI1MmJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia took a breath, flaring her aether to reinforce not only </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis’s Cloudwall</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, but also digging into her reserves to shore up her other heavily cloaked wards from a multitude of branches. She managed to avoid the beams but found herself heading straight for a tripwire. Seeing the collision was unavoidable, Amelia twisted her body to slash at the hellfire beam with her lightning claws.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmZmMDVjZTViMjRlM2ViZjBhYzg0NWE0MWM3ZDBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t help much, and the wire detonated with tremendous force. Amelia was engulfed in white-hot hellfire that dissolved through one entire third circle ward before being stopped by her more robust defenses. She was thrown through the room, triggering tripwire after tripwire, cascading into a devastating amount of demonic energy assaulting her tumbling form. Amelia cried out, not in pain but surprise, as the thunderous noise briefly paralysed her until she was able to channel her aether into her ears to protect them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2E0ZjE0MDYxYzQwYjNiNzA5ZTFkOWZmNzdjYTIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At this point, the spongy material that lined the rooms had all but melted, falling to the floor and bubbling into a tar-like consistency. The actual walls of the room were revealed, and Amelia was surprised to see that they were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wooden</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It looked like ironwood, but she couldn’t be sure. Runic patterns were etched into the surface. This Writing, which Amelia had no analogous concept from the game to compare it to, somehow interacted with the surrounding aetherfield to form a surprisingly resilient defensive structure. Turning her focus away from the walls, Amelia gazed upon her opponent.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDU5YTYzYmU2ZDRmYWJiYTQyYTIyM2VlZDg0MDEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria hovered a little above the ground, panting heavily, struggling to catch her breath.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjJhMmI1OTM4MDQzYTE5MDI0NmRhMTFkN2E3NGE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha… ha… Still standing, are you? This is…” The instructor swallowed heavily. “... Excellent training…” Amelia waited until the demon recovered before cycling her own aether, forming it into the complex shape required for her next attack. Since Lunaria had taken things to the sixth circle, and the surrounding walls had withstood that level of attack, Amelia felt it only fair she conducted her own magnificent finale!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTI3NmEzNGU3NTQxYWU5ZTE0OGY0NmQ0NzYxYTJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Brace yourself,” Amelia warned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjNjMGRiMDc5YjRjYzJhOTk2Njg0OTkyNmQ3OTM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She formed the sixth circle spell </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis’s Downpour</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the most powerful area-of-effect attack in that demonic branch. She poured her aether into the spell's construction, feeling it greedily suck more and more of the ethereal substance up. Amelia couldn’t help but giggle, feeling almost high on the sensation of such a powerful spell forming within her body. It was similar to how she felt constantly when she Spoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkMTM4Y2FmYmFjNDRmNzQ5MWJlYzU4ZTM5ZWFhMzMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Drunk on power.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODUxZTg2ZThmYjQ0ZGVhMWZkZWE4NGRmZjc3ZmU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Try this for size!” Amelia called out, spinning the formation within her and activating the spell.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjI0YjZlNjZjZTQ3NTZiMGFlYjUyN2JiNjg4NDQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait!” Lunaria called out, her voice suddenly stricken with panic. “Stop it! That’s a seventh circle-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDIyOTE3OTIyMjRmYWI5MDYzYTAzYTlhZjUxMmQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The bit of Amelia’s brain that wasn’t lost in the thrill of spellwork flashed a warning, and she instinctively tried to reclaim the invoked formation. It was only slightly effective, and as the spell manifested the rest of Amelia’s brain kicked into gear and she realised the scale of attack she’d just launched.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmVhYzhmMTRjMzQyYTc4N2ViNzM5YTU0N2UzZmM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Panicking, she frantically formed another invocation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis’s Cloudwall</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, barely waiting for it to complete its structure before launching it with all her might at Lunaria. The ward raced towards its target, reaching the instructor as the spell hit, painting the room in white as the aetherfield twisted from the density of attack that sought to destroy everything it touched.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWI0MjM4YTk5OTQ3YjlhMjE2YTk0NTNmNTM1ZmNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Writing on the walls only </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">just</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> managed to not shatter under Amelia’s spell. Unfortunately, the ceiling couldn’t boast the same level of resilience and enormous cracks formed across its length, breaking the runic patterns and dissolving the defensive ward they somehow manifested.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDZmYjIxNGQ4MjQwOGY4ZWZlOTJkYjEzZWZhZDEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If Amelia’s spell had continued for a fraction of a second longer, she would have blown the ceiling to kingdom come. Her frantic, last-minute attempt to reabsorb as much aether as possible was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">just</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> enough to prevent the worst from happening.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjg4Y2M1MGU4NzRkYTFiZGEwZjMxNGQxOWVkYzNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As her spell faded, Amelia threw out a healing spell towards Lunaria, only to find it blocked by her wards. Huh, that was new. “Hey,” Amelia said in an apologetic tone. She floated down to the instructor, who was on all fours, gripping the tar-like substance of the floor, now beginning to cool. “Are you okay? I can heal you if you release your wards.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGJiN2FhZGFiOTQzYWViMzdlZGI4MjY0MjE0Yjg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just a moment,” Lunaria mumbled. The instructor was still for a minute before turning to sit on her knees, facing Amelia. “Fifty-five years I’ve been alive, and I’ve never seen </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” She stared at Amelia earnestly. The woman was frazzled but otherwise seemed unharmed. Amelia’s hastily thrown ward had blocked most of her attack, and what little hit seemed to have been stopped by Lunaria’s own </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni’s Hellshield</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODFkYmU2M2E2MzQxYmVhNmQ4NjdkOWExMzdiYWRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seen what?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2VlODA5NTdhZjQxYWFhZThmMWUxMDZkZWU1ZmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That!” Lunaria waved her hands, getting more excited by the moment. “You! Casting a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">seventh circle</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> spell while only Speaking a First Word! I know </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is powerful, but his Word isn’t that powerful! It shouldn’t be possible! The aether requirements should be…” Lunaria trailed off before raising a suspicious eyebrow at Amelia. “You were holding back, weren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTk3MDViNGJmMDRjNDlhNjEyYzZkZDYwZmQ4MWEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia scratched her chin awkwardly. How should she answer? Her attempt to present herself as a talented - but not norm-shattering - Speaker had once again failed. How was she to know the spell that was sixth circle in the game was actually seventh circle in reality!? To be fair, she should have figured it out when she felt the formation sucking away far more aether than it should have, but she’d been caught up in the moment and hadn’t been thinking.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWQ0MTUyNGY2NTRmY2RhYjRhYWIyYWQ4ZWY0YjU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don’t want to answer, you don’t need to,” Lunaria said. The instructor took a deep breath before letting out a long, deliberate sigh. “Well, you pass. I’m going to have great fun looking at the faces of my students trying to crack your wards.” She looked up, her face contorting into a look of sorrow. “That old man’s going to take all my funding to repair that ceiling! Ah!” Lunaria bent forward, clutching her horns in a very Serena-like fashion. “He’s going to yell at me for hours! So unfair…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzUwZDZhYmM1YTQ3YmY5YzQ1NDlhNWMxYWU2MDM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The instructor sobbed quietly for a few minutes before collecting herself. Lunaria raised her head with a smile and asked, “Would you mind healing me? I fear I’ll fall asleep for a week without </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> golden grace.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOWI3OTk4Yzc2ZTQyYjdhOGVmMDZjOWQ5MzhiNmQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia obliged, casting a modestly powerful healing spell, wrapping the instructor with a golden warmth dotted with blue specks. “Ah…” Lunaria muttered, a distant look in her eyes. “To think I would feel this golden grace once again.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2UzNjk1N2M5NTQ5ODRhNjkxZTcwNDBlMGI2ODE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s eyes widened with surprise. “You’ve been healed before? By a human healer?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDMyOGU2NmM1YjRiZjViOTg4ZWI3NGFkOWU1N2Zh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve been around,” Lunaria replied nonchalantly. “It would be before your time, well, that is if you’re telling the truth about your age.” She sniffed. “A story for another time. One day, perhaps I’ll tell you.” The woman slowly climbed to her feet, and Amelia followed suit. They both took a moment to observe the destruction. The room was almost pitch-black, with only the glow from Amelia’s horns and Lunaria’s wings lighting the room. The aetherlights had long since been destroyed by their battle.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmE5MWUwY2NmZTQxNjU5MzRjNjY2ZWMxNzIwZTg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The glow of Lunaria’s wings soon faded as the woman released her Word. Amelia followed suit. As she released </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">the door to the room was flung open, and a demon with auburn hair and purple eyes strode through, carrying a presence of confidence reminiscent of how Serena strutted around the ship.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2ZmYTNiZjhhMjRhZjZiMDNiZjQ5NWFiMjk3NjM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everything alright, yes?” asked the demon in an unfamiliar accent. “Lots of noise.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWZlMmMxYzZhYTQxN2ViOThhOWJhMDczZDE2NzQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was due to the monstrous amount of aether that still saturated the atmosphere, as well as Amelia’s now-fading horns of aether-infused lightning that acted as attuned sensory organs. For a moment, as she set her perception upon the beautiful demon, Amelia caught a glimpse of something within her that straightened the hairs on the back of her neck.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjU4NmQ1OThlNTQ5NWJiOTA4NjQ1ZWJlMDlkYTBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was interesting.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2UzNGZjYmMyMzRlZGJiMTZiM2Q3ZDdjMmQwZjlj" style="margin-bottom: 2em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Very interesting indeed.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxY2U1ZmNjMzlmNDRkMzA5MDQ1OGM4NGIwYmRlODgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako covered her mouth and yawned. The lecture hall was the perfect temperature to lull her into drowsiness. Staying up late to cycle her aether had once again come back to bite her. She yawned once more, letting her body fall to the side until her head fell against the person to her left.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2Q0MDdmZTgxYjQ5MGU5NGFlMTk3YTg4ZDJiOTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…” she mumbled, feeling her eyelids grow heavy. “Don’t move. You’re my pillow for the next fifteen minutes.” Unfortunately, her pillow had other ideas and she was rudely shunted away.</span></p><span class="cjIzNTExNzg3ZDAyMDQzODFiZTU5NWY3NzRlZjAxNDc0"><br/>Unauthorized tale usage: if you spot this story on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM2Yjc4NGFlZjFmMzRkZDRiYzZiODVkZTY0ZWZhNDc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your fault,” Jayjay, her pillow, said. “You stayed up again practising, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWIyZGI2YjVmNzQ2NGM4MTlhYWY0NDY1ZmE5MDI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Never going to reach third circle if I take things easy.” Hinako rubbed her weary eyes, trying to massage the sleep away. “Wake me up when Head Instructor Inoue arrives.” She leant forward, burying her head into her crossed arms and closed her eyes, letting the chatter of her fellow mages lull her into sleep. Before she knew it, she’d left the waking world and entered a satisfying dreamscape where she was thrashing Jayjay in a duel.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODU5NzY4MjczNjQ0ODU5MjEyNGNkOWIxOTM3ZDk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was until an elbow into her ribs jolted her awake.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmE1MTU4NDQwMzRlZDlhNmMxNTc2ZGQyY2FjZTlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wake up!” Jayjay mumbled. “She’s here- wait…” Hinako did her best to blink away the sleepiness. “It’s Instructor Kawas,” Jayjay continued. “Is she taking over from Head Instructor Inoue?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTJmM2RkZjczNTRmNTA5MzA1N2NiNTdhZDRhYWI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s probably getting chewed out by the Grandmaster,” Kanoko said from her right. “That aether surge this morning, remember? I heard she blew the top out of one of the Speaker Rooms!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjE1YThhMDNiZjQ0ZTZiY2EzM2U4OTc3Nzk3YjM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako stifled a yawn, her vision clearing as she sighted Instructor Kawas making her way to the front of the lecture hall. “Mmm… seems like something she would do. We don’t call her the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aether Addict</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> for nothing,” she said. “Crazy that she managed it, though. The Writing in those rooms isn’t anything to shake a horn at.” Earlier this year, she’d run the calculations on the aether output necessary to crack the runic defenses. Poor Instructor Inoue, those walls weren’t cheap to replace.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTEzZTg1MTBhYzQ3MTZhNTA2YzQ1ZjNlY2VjOTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, hello!” Instructor Kawas called out from the front, pushing a little aether into her voice so even those at the very back could hear her. “Apologies for starting late, but we’ll be moving to Duelling Room One. Head Instructor Inoue has prepared a special practical lesson for you all. Follow me, please!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmY3NGYxNjc1ZDQwNjE4OWZkNjE1MGU2MWIyNzk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor Kawas walked towards the door, and the twenty-eight students of Senior Group B packed up their notebooks and followed her. Along the way, Hinako, along with her friends Jayjay and Kanoko, found themselves wondering precisely what the instructors had planned.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzA3Zjk2ZjViYTQxYzI4OTNhMDY0Yzg3NWFlZTYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope we’re picking duelling partners,” Hinako said, feeling the last vestiges of sleep fall away from her mind. “I just beat you in a dream, Jayjay, you know? Must have been a prophecy!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmI1YjM0NTNkODRiZGZiNjQzOWQxOWY1N2I0ZWMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s more to magic than duelling,” Jayjay lectured, wagging his finger. In response, Hinako only rolled her eyes. They didn’t understand it. Dueling was the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">purest</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> form of magical combat. Instead of spending her time on the front lines where any random shell could steal your glory, Hinako intended to fight her way through the arenas and fighting pits across the Empire!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDdhZmUxOTVmNDRkODJiMTBjOGNmYThmZTNiOGM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps, if she trained hard enough, then one day she could represent Asamaywa in the Speakers' Olympiad!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDAxZTJhNWZjMjQ3MGE4MmQzNmY4ZTQwODBlZTk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They continued through the corridors of the academy. While her friends bickered and chatted amongst themselves, Hinako entertained her mind with fantasies of standing on the podium, a gold medal in her hand, and the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">privilege</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of meeting with the Empress! Seven hells, just imagine! What would she even talk about if such a situation came about?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWY4NThmMzQxYjRiY2NhMjhmZDliNDFiMjg1N2Zl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right! In you go!” Instructor Kawas’s instructions pierced Hinako’s imagination and the class was ushered into Duelling Room One. Something was happening as those in front of her were suddenly gossiping intensely. Hinako pushed to the front, scanning the sandy arena for what had the rest of the class so disturbed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGUwZmZjYjJmMDQwNjhhMWQ4NDg3Njk3OWMwMTZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of them stood Head Instructor Inoue. Next to her stood a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. No, not just a human, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">the</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> human. The human everyone had been talking about. This was the first time Hinako had seen her in person and when she did, she found the photograph that had been printed on that morning’s broadsheets did not do her justice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWYyODc1MmJlMzQwNTc4M2Q4ZDVjMzFkNzc4NTRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">beautiful</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Hinako couldn’t help but feel a twinge of envy at the human's looks. Of course, she looked a little </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">weird</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, as all humans did without a set of horns on their heads. Hinako always thought human heads looked small and flat, but perhaps that was only because she wasn’t used to the hornless race.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2Y1MWQyNjM4MzRmNzliZTg5MGM1ZmJlODY2Mjky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, beyond that flaw, she couldn’t believe how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">attractive</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> this human looked. Hinako had no interest in her own sex; she would never fall into sin in such a manner. However, if she were born a man, then she, without a doubt, would try and bed this human. Her golden hair was just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">radiant,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and her crimson eyes, which Hinako had thought weren’t a natural eye colour for the human race, simply </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Her facial features somehow balanced both </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">cuteness</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">maturity</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. What a lucky human Amelia Thornheart was to be gifted such looks by the human gods!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2Q3YTgxNjIwZDRlN2U5MGQ2MTA1ODdkNzg1MWFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako must have been staring a little too intensely as suddenly she found Miss Thornheart looking straight at her. The human had an easy smile on her face, but the awkwardness of the sudden eye contact forced Hinako to snap her eyes to the ground. She counted to three and looked again, glad to see the human had moved on.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzc3ZWJkNDgwOTRmODU5ZDFhN2ZhYjhhMzYxMGEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quiet!” shouted Head Instructor Inoue, and the room instantly became silent. “Seven hells, you would think you lot have never seen a human before! Will you stand and stare when you meet them on the battlefield? Fools! Now then…” the Head Instructor cleared her throat, gesturing towards Miss Thornheart.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWZkZjVkYTYyNTRkY2Y4YmEwOWUxNWUxNjU0Yjg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is Amelia Thornheart. Recently sanctioned Lord-Prospect. Yes, that’s correct, the rumours were true. She really is a Lord-Prospect. Quiet!” Instructor Inoue bellowed as the murmuring resumed momentarily. “And for those who read that trash those fools pass as news these days, yes, she really is a Speaker!” At her words, another round of gossip between the students started.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzdjZmE4NmIzYzQwYTE4NjI3YTIxMDhiZDJhYTE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that possible? Look how young she is!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzgyM2RlNzVkYzQ3NWJhOGNiOGZhNjY3YWY1NzU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If true, she must have only recently communed, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTFmMzdhNzQxMzQwY2NhODg4NzRlOTdmZGRkNmIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe if she Spoke the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">weakest</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> human Words, it could happen…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWQwNmRlNzNhNjRmNmNiOGEzMmEzMDdjOTJlNzM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It must be a trick…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTBjYWIyZGNiYzRhODA5YzA4MzlhMzk0ZDZmYTUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quiet!” the Head Instructor clapped her hands. “Right! Here’s what’s going to happen. In a moment, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">we-</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” She gestured to herself and the human. “Will proceed to Duelling Room </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Two</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. One by one, Instructor Kawas will bring you in. Assistant Instructor Thornheart, yes that’s right, Assistant Instructor. Don’t you dare forget the title!” An aged finger was wagged at the class. “She will be waiting in the centre of the room. I will verify your attendance and cast a third circle ward on you.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmQ2MmVlMDk1ZDQxYWE4ODkzZTQ3MGYwYjVjYmVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You will then have fifteen seconds to protect yourself using your full capabilities. First circle, second circle, third circle, I don’t care. Fifteen seconds! Once that time has elapsed, I will ring a bell! And that’s when it begins!” Head Instructor Inoue paused, glaring at the class. “You will do everything you can to duel and win against Assistant Instructor Thornheart!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTljZmI4NGQ2YzQ2ZjlhNjgyZGJkZjc3YjQyZTc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Duel?” Hinako couldn’t help but ask the question.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTUzZDFhODFlZDRlMWQ5MTdhYjNlZTA4OTg2MTAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right!” Head Instructor Inoue nodded enthusiastically. “If Assistant Instructor Thornheat pierces your wards with her magic and strikes my own, you’re out!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGJmNjBhOWIzYjRkZmY5NzE5MWIwMTk4ZTQ2NTA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if we pierce hers?” a student called out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODUzZDQ1OTEwYTQ3NjhhNjQ2YTcyNzhiYzFmOWRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha! Fools, didn’t you hear me tell you she’s a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” Head Instructor Inoue put her hands on her hips and glared at them. “Don’t get ahead of yourself! You need to focus on </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">surviving!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWMzMDQ5OWU1ZTQ3ZmFiZjc0MTU4ZWU2ZTI3Y2Rh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Surviving? Hinako put a hand up, asking, “Head Instructor, if this hu- I mean, if Assistant Instructor Thornheart is a Speaker, then we would have no chance against her!” Around her many of her fellow students were nodding in agreement. Some of them, mostly the men, scoffed as if they thought they could beat a human Speaker regardless of whether they Spoke or not. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTIyOGFlMGIxNTQxMWVhYmYwN2VkNTcyM2VkZWE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The human in question quietly hummed to herself with a soft smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDAzNjQ0MTBiNDQzZTViNmUzYTJmYmQ3YzdkYWRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Obviously!” came the reply. “That’s why you’re going to have a handicap. Assistant Instructor Thornheart will not be invoking her Word! In fact, she will be limited only to first circle magic for her offense and her defense! Furthermore, I won’t be giving her any aid!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGE3MDFhNjhhNTQyYmRhNjIyNTE1Yzg0Yjg2ZjJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer sent more murmurs through the crowd of students. It was common knowledge that assaulting a ward with lower circle magic than what it was cast with was incredibly inefficient. Those who could cast second circle wards like Hinako would be wondering how in the seven hells this human was going to find the aether to break the wards.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjFlYTk4YjMxYzQyZThhZGQ3ZDRiZGE0YTI3Mjg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako scanned Amelia Thornheart. Sensing very little she found it more likely the Head Instructor was playing a trick on them. If this human were a Speaker then Hinako would be able to pick it up. Head Instructor Inoue, for example, gave off a tremendous aether signature wherever she travelled. Unless she was busy in some closed-off space cloaked by Writing, any student worth half their horns could track her down on campus.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmRhYmI4OWM1MDRkMjBiYWY4MmJhOGZhOTVkYTVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, Head Instructor Inoue was known for excessive aether usage, caring little for the art of cloaking herself against potential enemies.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWYxNDQxNDM1ZTQ3NDJhOGUzZTJiNDUzZmVkZTYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So is that the purpose of this duel then, Head Instructor?” a sarcastic voice sounded. Hinako turned to see it was Daichi, the most talented mage in the year. The man was already solidly in the third circle and was a favourite to win the end-of-year tournament. Daichi crossed his arms and continued, “What am I going to learn seeing my magic tear into this human's first circle wards, other than what a human corpse looks like before I step onto the battlefield?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTkzZWQ0MzU0MDQ2OTZhYWRmN2IyOTdhMGE3ZWNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The human, no, Assistant Instructor Thornheart, giggled before quickly covering her mouth. Everyone in the room looked at her, some with expressions of disbelief, some with expressions of amusement and, in Daichi’s case, anger.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2RkNDdmOGVmZDQ2MDA5YzhiNzkyZDczMWRkYWYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. Daichi, is it?” the human simply smiled for a moment. “Instructor Inoue told me about you. I look forward to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">experiencing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> your talent. As for what you stand to gain…” Assistant Instructor Thornheart glanced towards the Head Instructor, who nodded in return. “If anyone can break through my first circle ward, Instructor Inoue will immediately graduate them from this class with a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">distinction</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWQyZDJmMmU4ZTRiZjFiZTNkMDhmMDEwYWYzOGM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako somehow caught her mouth before it dropped open. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">There must be a catch</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she thought to herself. There was no way it was this simple.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGQ3ZjVhYzU3ZDRiZTM5OWVkMTViMGZlNTNlOGM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Furthermore,” Assistant Instructor Thornheart continued, “If anyone can maintain their ward against my first circle attacks for more than </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ten seconds</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, I believe Instructor Inoue will also graduate them with a distinction.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDlkYTI3MWE4ZjQ5N2RiZDk1ZmE4N2YyNWNmNGJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When she finished talking, no one talked for a dozen seconds.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDg3NGZhNmIxNjQ4MmNiYjU0MWVmZjRlMzY3OGJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s the trick?” Daichi eventually asked. “Do you have some kind of runic artefact?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjI2MzA0NGJkZTRiMTlhNjg4ZDNmNDkwMDBlYmQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Assistant Instructor Thornheart shook her head. “No, it’s as simple as it sounds. A duel. Aether against aether. Mage against mage. My first circle magic against whatever you can throw at me. Of course, don’t forget by having communed a Word, the gods have blessed me with an increase in abilities that enhance all my magic.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjBkYzZhZGJmMTQxYTJiYTg5ZTlkODViYmQzNTIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if that’s true,” Hinako blurted out. “The lasting communion effects </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">might</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> be enough to propel first circle magic into the next circle, but it’ll never come close to matching third circle magic!” She could see Daichi and other students nodding in the corner of her eye. “And, if I’m not mistaken, you’re going to duel </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">all of us</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? One by one?” Seeing Assistant Instructor Thornheart nod, Hinako shook her head. “It’s not possible. No one's aether reserve could last that long </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">without </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2QxNTIzZmU5MzQ2NTRhZGIxYmMyZDBlYWZiYWUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hinako, is it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTI3Y2ZlNGRjODQzMWViNjJiMDczNzczZDIzNGFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yes,” answered Hinako, surprised the human knew her name.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTA2MWQ4NTNiMjRhOTViYjQ2MTczOWFhMWQyMWM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve been told you’re mathematically minded. Is this the result of your calculations? That me lasting against all of you is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not possible</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” The human held Hinako’s gaze. For some reason, Hinako felt a shiver rippled down her spine.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzQ1NzQ5NjMxNDRlNDFiNTk0MmQxYjliNTU4OGM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” she answered after a moment.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWYzZjhjZTc4NzQ5YWY5MTM3Nzc2MTMxODVlMDM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I wonder what you’ll say to me when those calculations prove to be wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2M4YTM1YjdkYjRkMzliOGM4NmM5MzhhNjAyOWQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before Hinako could answer, Head Instructor Inoue clapped her hands. “Right! Enough talking! We’re going to get ready. Instructor Kawas will bring you through one by one! The order will be random! Write your name on some paper and give it to Instructor Kawas, who will shuffle them to determine the order. After the duel, you will return to the lecture hall! She will also inform you if the previous candidate won or failed! That’s all!” With a final clap of their hands, the Head Instructor and Assistant Instructor Thornheart left the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTFmODY1NGQ1ZTQ1NmZhYTllMmNlYjA5OGRlZDBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Before</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you start strategising,” Instructor Kawas called out, “Come write your name here!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzVjODZhYjdhMTQzNjZhZDAwMTM4MTI5MWM1MzYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once everyone had written down their names, Instructor Kawas ripped them into neat squares. She left the room, and the moment the door closed, everyone burst into a frenzy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjViOTQ4MDc3NDQzY2U4ZGQ1ZDQxMmRkM2IyMDUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There has to be a trick. There has to be!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjM0NTk3MzI0MTRhODI5N2I3ODc4OTkxMGQwZWY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“First circle might beat second, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">might</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">… but no way she beats Daichi!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTQ4OTUzZDlkNzQ5ZDQ4NWVjMjUxNTg3Yzg2ZGYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is she really only going to defend herself with first circle? She could die!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzUwZDdlMWNjOTRhNzZiYTcyMzljZjJjNjUzNWM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The later in the pecking order you are, the better your chances…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODAyMTljMzY0NDQzMzJhN2JjZGFjYTQyYzVmOGVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The last statement was mumbled by Hinako herself. Even if Amelia Thornheart possessed statistically unlikely amounts of aether capacity, she would surely be exhausted by the time she got through half the students, let alone the entire class!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODFkODE5YWIyNjQwZjhiNzYzYTNkMGU2ZjNlNjc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor Kawas returned, and the moment she stepped into the room, a tense silence enveloped the students. Despite the certainty that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">someone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> would beat the human opponent, everyone understood that the first person had the smallest chance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWQ2MDcyZmZjNDQwMmRhYmMwYTk3MTg2YmIwODM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eishun Toshiyasu!” she called. The student in question stood up and gave everyone a playful salute before following Instructor Kawas out of the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWZhM2UwMjFlNjQxMGQ5ZTBmNDJkODI3NjYyZWNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s first circle, isn’t he?” someone asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2I5MWI3N2ZkZDQ3MDBhZTU0ZDU2ZGMxN2ViZGU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Almost second,” someone else answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDQzODUxYTE3ZTRjZGY5ZmQwN2JhZGE3ZDc3Mzc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A little over a minute passed, and Instructor Kawas opened the door. Stepping through, she said, “Eishun Toshiyasu has lost to Assistant Instructor Thornheart. The next candidate is…” she looked at one of the paper squares. “Goichi Oya?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzRhMjM5ZjY5ZDQ0ZTc4MGIyMjc2NzQwY2IzNWYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Goichi jumped up, following Instructor Kawas to the door. Before leaving, he turned and bowed to the class. “I’ll see you on the battlefield, for I’ll be graduating shortly!” That earned him a few laughs. Shortly after, he was gone.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDViZWJlMWY1NjQxMGU5M2U0ODE4OWQ0NGM4MGFh" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Goichi’s second circle, isn’t he?” Kanoko asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2FiNDgyZmNmYjQzNDZiMTAxNzQ4NWYxMDdhY2Vi" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NTc5MjU2Yzg4NjQ3ODg4NTcxMTIyMGIzMGQxODY2" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Hinako answered. “And known for raw power. He trains his aether capacity against your spells, doesn’t he, Daichi?” She eyed the class’s most talented mage.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDk3NjBjZDRhODQ1MzFhMjdmMWUwNjZkODJiMDBk" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZTIxNWNmNWI2MjRkOThhMGY5YjBmYjMxYmI2MmYy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” he answered. “He’ll either win or exhaust the human, so the person after him wins. We’ll find out any moment.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmIzYmI3ZGI4NzRlYTdiNmYwNWZhNDdmYzc2YWEw" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNiOTAyMWUxYmMwNzRiNzVhYzNhZmU4MmFkMGUzMTJk" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thirty seconds later, Instructor Kawas appeared once again. She surveilled the room for a moment before stating, “Goichi Oya has lost to Assistant Instructor Thornheart. The next candidate is…” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2U2YjBkNzkyMjQ4MDViOTM0MTRkNDI5NWQ1Y2Q0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>The next candidate climbed up and left, and then a minute later, Instructor Kawas returned to inform everyone they’d failed to win their duel. Then, the following candidate was called, only for the same result to be announced a minute later.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTc1NmQwY2E5OTQ1OTViMTQ1YTNmYmY2NzIzZmQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the next.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWJjZTE4ODFlODQ4ODZiN2Y0MDE5YjY3ZWE0ZmQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And the next.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjU5ZjJlZTg4ZTQxYmRhNDk3YmEzZjg3ZmQyOTRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few more minutes passed and twelve students had left and reportedly failed to win against Assistant Instructor Thornheart. The atmosphere had changed entirely. Students no longer joked about early graduation when their name was called. Instead of faces filled with humour, the expressions became darker with worry and confusion. Discussion changed from banter and idle chatting to serious debate about what trick Head Instructor Inoue was pulling.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmRlMGE0MDNhNjRjNjNhZWM2MGEwZTc2MmYwZTZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe the lesson is not to be trusting,” Jayjay suggested. “Sure, they </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> there would be all these restrictions, but how do we know they’re not teaming up on you the moment you step into Duelling Room Two?” At this, several remaining students nodded, having come to the same conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmE1ZWYxY2Y3YTQ0NzVhMDM1MzVmNmM3MWVmYTU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe we’re being watched, and it’s a test to see how we react and strategise against seemingly impossible situations?” Kanoko offered. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDI1MzQ0NWZjMDRlNTg5N2VlYjU0MGQzMWIzNTY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could be,” Hinako said. “Maybe-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzIyNGQ5YjVlZTRhYzI5NWNkMWVmODQ5ZjRkZmIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was interrupted by the now familiar return and result announced by Instructor Kawas. This time, the name read from the paper was one everyone had been waiting for.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmM2MDU0ZWY4NjRkOGQ5Y2FkN2VhYzIxOTE3MWU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Daichi Ishitani”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGIyYzUxNDI5NDQ1MThiYWJjYjFhYjA4ZWJhOTVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The most talented student in Senior Class B stood up, his face filled with determination. Without saying anything to his fellow students, he walked out of the room. When the door closed, Hinako stared after him, her mind racing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTQwODJhNjVjNzQ5MjViNjViMTA0OTM2MmI1MTYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no way he can’t do it,” she said to herself as much as anyone listening. “If the rules they told us are genuine, then there’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">no way</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> his third circle magic loses to first circle. She must be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">exhausted</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> by now.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmZhNDM2NDUxYjQzNzBhYmNiOWYwNDU5ZmQyZTc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If Daichi couldn’t do it, then there </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">must</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> be some form of trickery going on. There could be no other explanation. If Amelia Thornheart </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a Speaker </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">permitted to use third circle magic, then it’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">plausible</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she could win against the entire class in a duel. Not likely, but plausible. But, restricted to only first circle while her opponents faced no restriction? Nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2FkZjNhMzdmNzQzOTI4MzY3NjEzNGNmMzc3ZGYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A little over a minute passed and the door opened once more. This time, every remaining student stood up to hear the result. Instructor Kawas looked over them all individually, appearing to find the room's atmosphere amusing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzA2YTAwNGVlYzRmNWJiYTQzZGZmZTRkZmJkMjM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Daichi Ishitani has lost to Assistant Instructor Thornheart,” she said plainly. “The next candidate is… Hinako Aikawa.” As Hinako’s eyes met the instructor’s, a sinking pit of anxiety formed in her stomach. Hinako stood up, shocked to find her legs a little unsteady.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWVmZjhlZTQ3OTQ5OTA4MjExMzZjOWNmOTcwZjdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You got this!” Jayjay said cheerfully, clapping her on the back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDAxNmUzYTUwMTQ4MjY5YTY4ZTAyYzcwYWY3YzQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! Go weaken that human for me!” Kanoko added in with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Mzk0N2UyZjlkNDRkZjFiYmUwMzk0MTNiNzlmNTVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks, you two…” Hinako muttered before following Instructor Kawas outside. The moment the door shut and they were alone in the corridor, she asked, “So, what’s the trick?” She wasn’t expecting a truthful answer; instead, she hoped to decipher some information from whatever answer was given.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDIyMDIwZDhkODQ0ZGI4NzNkODlmZDcxMzM2OGYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No trick,” Instructor Kawas replied, moving to stand poised to open the door to Duelling Room Two. “You’re the third person to ask that. No tricks beyond this door, only a human that challenges your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">calculations</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Instructor Kawas gave Hinako a sly smile before pushing her through the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTJjNWZlZTdhOTQyMWI5ZGJhYmJkN2FkNWIzN2Rm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Stepping through, Hinako immediately began forming her best ward, only to quickly be shouted at by a relaxed-looking Head Instructor Inoue sitting in a chair to the side.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWMzZmMxNjZjNzQyYTFhOGQ5OTEzMzRkNWI2NDcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not yet!” she barked. “Wait till I say your fifteen seconds have started! Name?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjI4MzJlMDM1YzRmZjhiZDBiOTkxMDNhMGZjZmM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was there no trick? No ambush? </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTNkYjI5YTg1ODRlOTdiM2I2MTBiNjI0ZDRlZGJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako sensed the room. She was getting better by the week at perceiving the aetherfield, and she could tell a lot of spellwork had recently been conducted in this room. Was she sensing the remnants of Daichi’s efforts? </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTBhYjExMWE0YzQ3ZDA4NjI2YjI2N2RjYzAxMjkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And there was Amelia Thornheart, seemingly looking unaffected as if she’d barely been put under any pressure. Was this really her true appearance? Was she under a glamour by Instructor Inoue to appear so calm and… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bored</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDZkZjMzMDQ1YjQ0OTc4ZDVhOTJlZjlmOWZhOTlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Name!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGE2MmQyYzM2MTQwODZhNTU4M2Y1ZDNjMDc1MTFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sorry!” Hinako collected herself. “Hinako Aikawa!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzcyNDM3ZjdmYjQ3MTRiYTUzNWVmN2RjODBkZTk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hinako Aikawa… check,” Head Instructor Inoue nodded and then Hinako felt a powerful ward wrap itself around her body, sticking like a second skin. It was sudden, but she felt oddly secure. This was a third circle ward by </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria Inoue </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">herself! “Right, you have fifteen seconds until the duel begins. You win if your ward lasts ten seconds or you destroy Assistant Instructor Thornheart’s. You may begin attacking when the bell rings. Begin!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmUzYjhlNTdkYTQ2MjViY2QxZTIzYWUwNTc1MDVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako threw herself into her magic, spooling up her aether, circulating it with as much recklessness as she could risk. After five seconds, she’d formed the required structure and then spent the next ten refining it and pouring in as much aether as possible. Just before the bell rang, she activated the ward, cloaking herself in the most extensive ward she’d ever produced under pressure. Glancing upwards, she saw Amelia Thornheart had simply conjured up a modest-looking first circle ward.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDhjNGI1MWEzZTQwMjViNGM0YzUzYTIzM2M0Y2Zh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni’s Barrier</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjFhYzA0NTA2YTQyNjNiNjlkZWIzMmNhNmM4OTI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako flared her aether, focusing everything she could on her defense.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmE3MmE1YWI2ZTRiMjg4NmZkNmM0NmE2YTU5MWJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The bell rang.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODRiOWFhM2M2NDQ2Y2ViOWQ3NTgzMjkzYTBlNmRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What followed in the next three-quarters of a second left Hinako speechless.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWVjZWU3OWY0YzRiZTRhMTU2NjFmNGFhNWE5ZDMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">From her newly found position sprawled upon the floor, she looked up at Assistant Instructor Thornheart's face as the human reabsorbed the remains of the attack magic she’d just cast against her. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2RlNTgwOWQ1NjRhNmI4N2QxM2EyNjlhYjFiZDFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she found her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGMxNGQ2NDdjNzQwNDU5YTU4MzRkYTM0Y2Q2MTAw" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please, teach me,” she asked, touching her head to the floor.</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Fifty-One: Firemint Tea</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMzMGMxOWY0ZDBiZTQ1MjM5ZjU0OTFlMjM4NDJlZWFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmY5MDBlNDRhZjQyODY5YTRiNTJjMzI2N2ViNTk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the academy’s central throughway, Amelia found herself lost in thought as she idly perused the display cabinets lining the walls. Contained within were martial weapons of all types, to which Amelia paid little attention. Her mind was occupied with recent events, and the passing student gossip barely registered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTc0ZjMyMWNmOTQzZTVhYjllNzc1ODdhMWM4NmNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was filled with a mixture of excitement and doubt. One of the students, a second circle mage named Hinako, enthusiastically requested Amelia’s tutelage. The request was delivered with such solemn determination that Amelia was once again reminded that the magical capabilities she took for granted were of life-changing importance for many of the academy’s students.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTkxNDc5MzNmMDRiZGJhZWE2Yjg1ZDU1YWI0Nzdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia had agreed, caught up in the excitement of the prospect of developing her own group of disciples. That wasn’t anything unusual; the teaching documents she’d gone over made it clear that instructors could - and were encouraged to - take on students as direct disciples if it wouldn’t interfere with their other teaching obligations. Instructors competed with each other vicariously through their disciples at the end-of-year tournament. Given the opportunity to join the fun, Amelia surprised herself by how quickly she jumped at it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2Q2YTMzOTBjYTQwZGI4YjkwNjg0MzE4OTM3NjJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that the dueling class was over, Amelia had some time before her next obligation. Instead of returning to her room or hunting down Serena - an easy task requiring her to only follow the aether pouring out from her - Amelia instead took solitude in exploring the academy. Strangely, as the minutes ticked away and her mind started to go in circles, she found the previous excitement at being Hinako’s tutor slowly replaced with a gnawing doubt.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjRmNmQ0MTdmZjQyYjM5NWYyZTQ5Y2QyMDkxMzcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now she had time to reflect, Amelia realised she very much </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wasn’t</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a good teacher. She</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> might</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> become one in the future, but for now she could honestly self-evaluate herself as clueless. She might be a powerful mage, but her capabilities, which she controlled with a supernatural level of instinct and intuition, had been </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">somehow</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> created from her time playing a game. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Doing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> magic came easy to her but </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">teaching</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it was a whole other story. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDI1NzRhZDYzNDRlY2U4YzM2NWY2MWQ1NDgyOWFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her time in Kenhoro, where Serena and Grandpa Gu taught her, made her realise how different the teaching skill set was from simply learning the taught skill. Serena was an excellent swordswoman and a good teacher, but Grandpa Gu was exceptional in both. The ability he had to spot Amelia’s mistakes with her sword before she even had a chance to accidentally ingrain them into her muscle memory was phenomenal. He guided her down a learning path customised for her effortlessly. It was a skill backed by his own experiences of training hundreds, if not thousands, of students over decades.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODE1MTE0OGI1MTQyZWFhZDBmNTE5NGViOTk5ZjYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia hadn’t trained hundreds or thousands of mages. She hadn’t even trained </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She didn’t know the common pitfalls students faced when trying to cycle their aether and form the simple formations of ordinary first circle magic. What would she be able to do? Other than saying, ‘It’s easy, just do it like this!’ it wasn’t like she actually knew how structured magical learning went.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTIxODFlYTYwZTRiNDA4NjYwMjQ2MGUyOTU4OTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assistant Instructor Thornheart, you have a disconcerting look about you,” a smooth feminine voice intoned, dripping with alluring charisma. Amelia turned to see Sarafina Nakajima, the Head Instructor for the Department of Intelligence and Security. Serena told her that Instructor Nakajima had previously worked in Centralis Intelligence before recently becoming an instructor.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDZmNzExMjYyZTQ5YzI4MzAxZmE1MWU3MTc1OTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instructor Nakajima,” Amelia replied. She opened her mouth to say that everything was fine but stopped herself. Perhaps the instructor could give her some advice. Amelia threw up a sound-blocking ward around them. Instructor Nakajima raised an eyebrow but otherwise didn’t comment on it. Sound-blocking wards were a common act of privacy in a world where so many had enhanced senses.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGU2ZWZjZTNmODQyNzM4ZDgzMTgzZWIzMDkwMjg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A student recently requested to become my disciple,” Amelia began, recounting the events that transpired an hour ago. “I accepted, as I was happy to see a demon willing to learn from me, a human. Only…” Amelia took a breath. “Now I realise I don’t have any teaching experience and am concerned I might delay or otherwise negatively affect the student's development.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDkzYjI5ZWM0NjQ1ZmFhY2U2MzQ2M2FmYzJkNjUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor Nakajima simply blinked at her, and Amelia blinked back. Eventually, the Head Instructor opened her ruby lips. “This happened in your first class?” she asked, slightly tilting her head. Seeing Amelia nod, a small smile appeared on the instructor’s face. “My my… one class, and you already have students requesting your tutelage. What in the seven hells did you do to them?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjM3NDA4YTgyZDQyNGNiMjJhNDIzZDg4MGFiNTAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, uh, dueled them under Lunaria’s instructions.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjdjZGFjODVkYzRkYjNhODgzZGUyZWU4ODFhNzk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lunaria, I see. Seems like something she would do. After the pair of you caused so much damage this morning I can see how she’d be inclined to take out her despair on the students.” Instructor Nakajima raised a hand to cover her mouth, quietly giggling. “I wasn’t there to see it, but many of us sensed your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> invocation. Your power must satisfy the rumours, for the Writing on those walls makes for a comprehensive cloak. I would know.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTI3NThjMTY2ODQ3MGI5Y2VhOWQ5MjhmOTEyM2Qx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia couldn’t help but ask, “What rumours?” She’d overheard all kinds of nonsense spouted by the students but wondered what a former Intelligence Officer thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTFjYzdmODFmMjRhNGRiOGY2YmYzNDFiMjZlMDY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…” Instructor Nakajima leaned in slightly, lowering her voice. “I’ve retained all manner of contacts, and one of them told me that the aetherscope installation that monitors the Nai inlet recently picked up an unusually powerful invocation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. An invocation that occurred around the same time a cutter went down while on its way to Shimashina. A cutter that Instructor Halen was reportedly travelling on. You see…” Instructor Nakajima leant in even further, now with a sly smile. “Normally, such an event would be a catastrophe. Even with a talented Speaker like Instructor Halen to protect the survivors from the wildlife - the collision would cause many casualties. However, in this case, there was barely a scratch on any passengers or staff. Almost as if </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">someone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> did an awful lot of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">healing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzdlN2MyYTk2NzQ0OWQ4YjBjOWJjOWU2NDcyYTFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The demon leaned back, stifling a yawn. “You’re a known Speaker of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Assistant Instructor Thornheart. Doesn’t take a genius to put the two horns together.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTI4NDdjZWJhZjRjZWJiYjU2MmQ2MjBlYzM0Y2Fi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia responded with an anxious smile. By now, she’d come to understand her being a Second Word Speaker would become well known. When she’d first come to this world, she’d hesitated to use too much magic, concerned about what detection spells there might be. Never would she have thought there were enormous aetherscopes that could detect her Speaking from thousands of miles away! </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGYwNmM0Y2YyZDQ2ZTQ4NzEyNWMyZmU4MjM3OTA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that she couldn’t potentially hide the fact in the future. Speaking the First Word silently was something she’d got a good grip on. Would she be able to do the same with the Second Word? Perhaps she could be dropped off somewhere remote, in the center of the great desert in the Southern Terra Firma, or maybe on a remote island outside the range of any aetherscopes or slumbering animal gods. She could then practice Speaking not just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> but also the range of more powerful demonic Second Words she knew.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDg2MmM1NmJhYjQyYWM5OWIwOTgyZDY1YTJiNTQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many, uh, people do you think have been able to put those two horns together?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGU5ZTExNmIwMjRlYzI5MzgwN2RjMTZhOGJjNGJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyone with a few brain cells, although many will still reject after hearing your supposed age, which for the record, I am rather suspicious about. Not to worry,” Instructor Nakajima nodded her head solemnly. “A woman’s age is a sacred thing, so I won’t ask.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2Y1ZmM4OGU2ZDRiYmM4N2Q0MDE5ODA5ZDEzMzhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you’ll rely on your contacts to find out instead, right?” Amelia said, feeling amused as the topic of her suspicious age once again came to light. No matter how many times she told the truth that she was twenty-five, people didn’t fully believe her. If her memory was correct, Amelia had answered that question when Serena interrogated her when they first met. The axiom crystal should have recorded her telling the truth, but apparently, they weren’t as reliable as a genuine, divinely-blessed truth-teller like Polina.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzU5MDg1MzgzNDQxOTk5ZDBlNGY5M2JkNjA5OTUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She also noted Instructor Nakajima’s usage of the term </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">brain cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She hadn’t explored this world's knowledge of biology much, but that term alone told her quite a lot about where they were. When Amelia woke in the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> captain’s quarters and was greeted by its sword-wielding, nose-poking captain, she’d initially thought she was actually in the medieval game world she was so familiar with. Only after she’d seen the firearms and metal behemoth that was the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> proper did she realise this world’s military technology and ship design more closely resembled the warships she’d seen in documentaries recounting humanity’s hundred-year recovery after the Sixty Second War in the twenty-seventh century.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWVjNTE4YTk5ODQ1ZGI4ZTliNzFjMDNkNTBhODE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh dear, my natural inclination to ramble has taken us off-course,” Instructor Nakajima intoned softly. “You don’t have any obligations until after lunch, correct? I believe you requested Lunaria to sit in on the crystal-craft sessions?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjk3ZmUzZjQ4YzRmMDZiMjFiMTc1MjlmYWNiZGEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem to know my schedule well,” Amelia said, crossing her arms while failing to sound annoyed. Something about Instructor Nakajima resonated with her. The smooth-talking ex-Intelligence Officer reminded her of her friend Aiden Adachi.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmQ2ODliMGM3ODQyZTlhMGQ5NmI1NGVlMTIzNTYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that is, if Aiden wasn’t an incompetent drunk that was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">definitely</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> going to be encased in stone the next time Amelia saw him. Instructor Nakajima did, however, share his amenable and easy-going attitude. Besides, Amelia’s instincts viewed the demon in a good light.</span></p><span class="cjI5NjNmOTc3ZmQzODQ2MmFiOWRmNzdkNjE3MGNiYTJm"><br/>Unauthorized use: this story is on Amazon without permission from the author.

<p class="cnM5NWMxODkzZWRlMDQxMTNiODU2YTMzYTExOTZmOTEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s my nature, after all,” came the reply. “Would you like some tea in my office? I have a collection of tea leaves that are the envy of even the most snobbish Fengra merchant. I’d like to discuss your concerns with this newly found disciple of yours further, as well as to get to know you better.” The demon's eye twinkled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTA5YzM0OTk0YjQ2OGI5NjZlYWNmYzUxNDU3Yjlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm! Sure!” Amelia exclaimed, feeling some of her worries melt away. Looking back on the years she spent in the hospital made her realise how much time she’d wasted ruminating on her situation instead of working to improve it or otherwise change her mindset. For this new life, she promised herself she would be far more proactive and engaged with everything and everyone! </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTYwZTlkOGMwNzQ0ZWFhZWQ3MzkwNWRhZmFjODE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They travelled through the academy towards the instructor’s office. Amelia tried to emulate the woman’s posture and presence. On a personal level, she preferred the way Serena strutted around with an air of command. Still, for the sake of Amelia’s role as an Assistant Instructor and now personal tutor, she figured she needed to come across as authentic as she could.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWFkNTU5Y2E4OTQ5OGQ4NjgxZjM4MTVlZWEyZTFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She felt she was getting pretty close to imitating it when the sight of an auburn-haired demon passing the hallway in front of them unconsciously caused Amelia to pause for half a step. It was barely a moment, and Amelia wasn’t sure the purple-eyed demon was even aware they were there. Still, something in Amelia’s body language must have given Instructor Nakajima a clue that her guard was up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjg4OWExM2I3ODQyODY4Y2JlYjRmNjA5NjNhYmI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s unusual, isn’t she?” the instructor said softly once the demon in question was long out of earshot. “Have you two met?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzRkZWFhMzNiOTRlYTZhMWUyZjEzYThkMjU1ODlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not properly. She burst into the room after Lunaria and I finished our duel. I think the amount of aether we were cycling caused concern.” Amelia gave Instructor Nakajima a side glance. “What do you make of her?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzJiN2UyNjNlNDQzMTA5OWEyNWY0ZmQ3YzAxNzIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A valuable talent. She’s done much for the Empire.” the demon replied plainly. “The war has caused many of the northern demons to… change. Many of them carry a subtle anger. Be wary of it. Especially as you’re human.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGY4NWUzOTU4YzQxOTBiZmZlNTcxZDQ0YjhmZGI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right…” Amelia looked back momentarily at the space Katalin of Driss disappeared through. She’d already decided not to tell Serena about her suspicions while they were at the academy. At least, not unless it was needed. Likewise, if Katalin of Driss somehow ended up part of Serena’s elite group of soldiers, then she would have to speak up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2JhMDAzZmM1ODRjOTU5ZDVkMDQ5Y2U0YjMzNmZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When they arrived at Instructor Nakajima’s office, Amelia was surprised to find it warm, with a cosy fire burning in a small wood burner. She noted that it also contained a few cabinets of ancient-looking weapons displayed in a museum-like fashion, much like the cabinets she’d been idly perusing earlier. When she asked about it, she was told, “We are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">samino</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">; we have always revered the weapons of our warriors. The city administration has the original spear wielded by Sango in its lobby. Check it out if you’re passing by. The old runes inscribed upon its blade still glow in the dark.” Instructor Nakajima looked at the shattered pieces of metal lying upon black cloth. “That there is one of the Empress’s blades. We have restorationists coming soon to repair some.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWM3OWE1NjY0YzQxNGU4YmZiY2RiYmQ3N2I3YzZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-really?” Amelia stuttered, giving the artefact another look over. “Wouldn’t something like this be more important? Displayed elsewhere?” It seemed unusual that a historical weapon once wielded by the Empress would be lying around in Instructor Nakajima’s office.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDkwZTgzMTU5NjQ3YTE4NjZhNTU3MTIzYTliMGEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really,” came the pointed reply. “It’s one of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Thousand Blades</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. When the Empress defeated the Eastern Titanlord - a terrible General of the Enemy that ruled over the defeated kingdoms - she shattered a thousand blades upon the creature’s almost impenetrable hide before finally breaking through. Most of them are recovered. The academy alone has over fifty. They’re dotted all around the place. Ones like this one,” she said, gesturing towards the shattered metal. “Are less valuable. The more complete one is, the higher it’s worth.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTIwNzVlZmY0YjRjZWFiY2FmYmE4ZjUzZmY0OTNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A thousand blades? She went through that many?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2I3YTc4MTc5MjQ4MjY5OTFjZmZmN2NiZjljZTE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She sure did,” Instructor Nakajima said, the twinkle in her eye returning.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTlmNzdhMDIzMzQyMmJiNmJkOGVmNTdiOTU0MTky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t she think after the first hundred didn’t work, then perhaps…” Amelia raised her palms flat, shrugging, “...That she should try something else?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTUxYzkyY2IzYzQ5ODRhZjFjN2Q4MGJmZWNmZTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pfft!” the instructor blurted out and then broke into an uncontrolled laughter that was so unlike her normal demeanour. “Haha! Yes…” She wiped a tear. “Perhaps she should have. You should tell her that, should you two ever meet. I would love to see the face she would make!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDlhOTI2MzNkODRhYmVhNzI3MjJiZWM0YWUyODIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia giggled. “Maybe I will! I’m told there’s a good chance she’ll want to speak to me at my oath ceremony in the capital.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzc4YmU1OGFiNTQ3ZTU4MzAxYWQ0NDViOTVhNjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now there’s a thought,” the demon said with a smile. “Here, sit.” Amelia took a seat on the couch while Instructor Nakajima placed a teacup before her. The instructor set about brewing some tea and it wasn’t long before an unusual fragrance filled the room. As if predicting the coming question, the demon explained, “It’s firemint from the North. It’s strong, and it crackles on your tongue and down your throat. A strange but pleasant feeling. It’s a staple of the Northern Army’s rations.” A cup was poured, and the pungent mint smell filled Amelia’s nostrils. “It’s also fed to children to warm them up.” Nakajima was the first to take a delicate sip. “Ah, mint tea keeps me going.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDg0OTI4ODgzMzQ0OWFhYzc1ZWI1ZDEyNjhhNjI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia followed suit, and as she tasted and swallowed the liquid, an intense crackling sensation erupted down her throat. It reminded her of the popping candy she had as a child, but with a far more potent effect. She coughed, prompting a laugh from the instructor. Taking a smaller sip, she savoured the sensation. “It’s good! Is it expensive?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmNmNGQ1NGRlMTQ0ODZiNzQyMjA0YmJiMGY4ZGZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here? Yes,” the demon answered. “In the North, not so much. It grows wild on the mountainsides. I believe the crackling is a defensive mechanism against predators, but we are far too large to be harmed and can instead enjoy the sensation.” She took another delicate sip. “I dug this out from my stores for Katalin, but I haven’t found the opportunity to socialise with her yet. We only really see her during the training sessions.” The instructor sighed with a forlorn expression. “She’s a wondrous demon…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTE4ZDI2ZjAyNTQ5YTY4Y2YwMmE2NzdmZGI4OTc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re not bad yourself,” Amelia pointed out. “Your cloaks are some of the best I’ve ever seen. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaxai</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, right?” The demon god of trickery was an obvious choice for a former Intelligence Officer. Amelia reckoned that most mages and warriors wouldn’t be able to identify the almost imperceptible yellow aura wrapped around the instructor.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDMwYjJiYjgwYjRkZjQ5MDZmOTc3N2M4YzkxYjA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh?” Instructor Nakajima raised an eyebrow after Amelia pointed out she could see the subtle aura. “Very good, Assistant Instructor Thornheart. Excellent perception. Most would need to Speak to see through my cloaks. Cloaking has always been my talent. I wanted to be an ice mage growing up, but fate had a different plan.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzFlYmI5YzgwNDRhNDJhM2Y2OTYwOTUzOTllNTM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of stuff did you get up to?” With the demon's skill, Amelia could imagine her pulling off all kinds of disguises to conduct espionage and assassinations. “During your time in Intelligence, I mean. Bet you did all kinds of secret missions with those skills.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjU1NWMzZmZiYTQ1YmY5YTg2OTNjMjk4MDZjYzE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps,” Nakajima smiled, then hid her mouth with the teacup, the rising steam blurring her face. “If I did, I couldn’t possibly tell you about them. What I can tell you is I spent many years in a diplomatic role. I was an advisor to the Cascadian ambassador to Ulm.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDdmNTJlMGM0ZjRjNjY4NDFkMDllMWM5NGFjZjgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia blinked, remembering the maps she’d committed to memory. Ulm was a prosperous city-state bordering the northwest of the Republic along the western coast of the human continent. “What was it like?” she asked. “To be a demon in human territory?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTA5NWUxNTM5MDQ3MGNhYzUxNTc0MjRkMDcwZTJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Instructor Nakajima raised a finger to her chin. “Things were bad when our group arrived and,” her eyes widened as if exasperated. “Terrible when we left. The war set back relations fifty, perhaps a hundred years. I fear they will get a lot worse before they get better.” Her eyes narrowed. “When it started, we saw the war as a conflict between ideologies. Then, the humans started to see it as a racial conflict fueled by their silly interpretation of Christ. And now…” the instructor sighed. “Now it seems demonkind has followed down the same path. Honestly, I don’t know if it’s a good or a bad thing that you’re here. The only thing easing my doubts is the Eastern Overlord sanctioned your presence. Here at the academy, all of us hope you live up to whatever expectations he has for his new Lord-Prospect.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTA5MjcxOTE2MTQ5NGNhMTk4YjhjYTk0NzRmYWU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Any advice on living up to the expectations my disciple is going to have?” Amelia asked, turning the conversation back to the original topic.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGM2MjY4NGNlYzRjOWZiMzdhYTgwNjQ5NGI1MGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes.” The demon placed her cup down, crossing her legs and placing her hands on her knee. “You said you have no teaching experience?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWVkYWNmY2Y0MTQ4NmE5NGM3NjIzMGJmZDc0ODg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Correct.” Amelia gave a quick recount of the event that caused Hinako to request Amelia’s guidance so earnestly. The demon didn’t seem surprised that Amelia took on an entire second-year class while limiting herself only to the first circle. Nakajima knew she Spoke a Second Word, so her victory against the students wouldn’t be unusual.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjVlOWQ0NDJhMDQzOGRiZjE0N2MxZTVjNzBhNmIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">And to think, I can do so much more,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzRjZWFiOTY1MDQ2N2FhMDRmZTQ2ZGZiYWY1ZTI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then your best bet is to be honest. If you trounced poor Hinako in a duel, then she’ll be able to excuse any lack of teaching skill from you due to your tremendous talent. She will think, ‘Of course, this human doesn’t know the first thing about teaching; they must have spent their entire life cycling aether!’ You just need to be upfront about that and let her know you’ll be learning as much from her as she will from you. Our students aren’t idiots. She can tell you what she thinks she needs to help her grow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjgzNmRhMzEwOTQxNTg5YmFhOTdhYjE5MzY5YjBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And even if that turns out to be inefficient, Hinako Aikawa is known to have her eyes set on the arena. Just by dueling her repeatedly, she’ll be sure to develop and discover insights independently. You don’t need to hold her hand. You’re not much older than she is, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmM2ZDk2ZWU2MjQ2MDliYTI0ZTQ5ZWRiNzY4ZTYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded, feeling a sense of relief. The demon's words were enough to make Amelia cast away any inclination she had to try to present herself as a stringent, formal instructor. She would take a more friendly approach to the whole situation, one which aligned closer with her honest and open personality. After all, she’d learned a lot about control by dueling the class one by one. More duels would help Amelia understand herself and her titanic powers even more.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2FjZGY0OTNmMjRiYjU4MGEzMzc0NDUwMzJkNDgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two chatted further while enjoying the crackling firemint tea. In the end, the demon insisted Amelia call her by her first name, Sarafina, in the future. “But not around the students,” Sarafina pointed out. “Keep it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor Nakajima</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, lest we be accused of not providing a professional learning environment by the local nobility.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmU5OTA1NDYxZTQyODc5NjM1YzBjNjAyMTBhNjE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, mmm!” Amelia nodded happily. Soon, the bell rang, and Amelia had to rush to her appointment. Giving Sarafina her thanks, she clambered up and headed to the magic tower where a session on crafting aetherlights and other equipment from moon crystals was about to start.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2Q5OWE4OTNkMDQ5ODg4MmE0NWQ2NGU3OTcxOWY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZWI1YzhhZTBiODRiMWI4NjBjMjYwZTEwNmJkZDYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Sarafina POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/sarafina.png" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTVkZjVkNzRjODQ2YWRhNTE0MmIzNmU2YWFjYzQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With Amelia Thornheart gone, Sarafina refilled her mint tea before relaxing into her chair. Her mind raced over all the little bits of information she’d gleaned from the human. Someone like her didn’t need to ask probing questions to fill in the gaps in her knowledge. The subtle changes of the human’s pulse, how she breathed before she spoke, where her eyes lingered and for how long. All these small signs told Sarafina everything she wanted to know.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTU3NDM5NzU1YTRiOTE4MDczNTQ4OTdjMWU4ZDU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A pleasant, amenable personality,” Sarafina muttered, finalizing her judgement of the human. She paused before adding the one statement she knew she would need to for her mind to be satisfied that it fully understood Amelia Thornheart.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTJiOTNjMzFjYzQzZmI4OTI5ODI1OGU3YmU3OWI3" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And definitely a monster.”</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNiOWFmNTE5Y2NjZTQxMzg4ZDM4ZGUxMmQ1ZDI0NjE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzJiNTg0YzRiODRlZmE5NjA4MTgzNDFmNDVkZjBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia walked as quickly as she could without embarrassing herself. She would only be a few minutes late. Her chat with Sarafina Nakajima had occupied too much time! Sarafina’s company was pleasant and Amelia made a mental note to acquire her own batch of firemint tea leaves. It would compliment her jimari coffee beans quite nicely.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjM0YjFkY2Y3ZTQ1NGRiNTU0ZDc0YWQ3NTIyZTZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although now wasn’t the time to be thinking about tea. Amelia entered the magic tower and hurried up its spiralling staircase. About halfway up, she double-checked the brass plaque that indicated the floor and stepped off. The magic tower’s rooms were arranged in a circle on each floor, with their doors facing the center. A balcony ringed each floor and provided the only walking space. The academy had installed nets on each floor, stretching from the balcony edge to the stairway, saving any student unlucky enough to fall.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDA5MzlhNjhjNjQxZDRhZGUyMTU1OGU4OGU4ZWNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Workshop D…” she muttered, circling the floor and quickly finding the target door. Taking a deep breath and mentally hoping that not everyone would stare at her, Amelia pushed open the door and stepped through.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDhmN2ZiNjdlMDQ1MGU4NmYzYmVjNDNmYjVkNjVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, everyone stared at her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmMwYTZlMDNjZTRjMTk4MDIwZmMzMGExMTMxNWIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Three dozen students and a handful of staff all stopped what they were doing and stared. Silence enveloped the room.. By now, she’d grown used to people staring at her. After all, who could blame them? She was radiant, cute, and mysterious! Resisting a giggle, she exclaimed, “Hello! I’m sorry I’m late! Lunaria, I mean, Head Instructor Inoue permitted me to sit in!” She punctuated her greeting with a polite smile and waved, adding, “Nice to meet you! I’m Assistant Instructor Thornheart!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTQ0YWUyZThiOTRlZTk5N2Y5OGVjMjY3MjIxYjEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The unfamiliar instructor leading the class recovered first. Amelia put him down as a Southerner because of the man's marbled skin and ram-like horns. He coughed into his hand and said, “Ah, yes, Instructor Kawas, could you be so kind as to take Assistant Instructor Thornheart into your group?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjRmNDhkMWU3MzRkZmFhYjVjMjllOWFjNjZkZGRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia looked across the room to see a familiar face. Instructor Kawas panicked slightly before jumping into motion, pulling an empty desk into the group she seemed responsible for. With a nod towards the southern instructor, Amelia approached Instructor Kawas.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTM5MzNlZmRhNzQ5NDk4NTE2YWMxYTRjOWNlZTBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello again,” she whispered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDFkZTIwZjBmZDQ0YTA5OTQzN2JjYmI3NmYzOTBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assistant Instructor Thornheart, welcome,” Kawas replied as she placed an array of tools on Amelia’s desk. “Ignore the rest of the class; Instructor Abbas is teaching advanced theory. This group is focusing on introductory theory and practical applications, led by myself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmZiZGQ1MDNjNDQ0MjBhMWNlYTJhMmQxZjhkY2Iw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Amelia nodded, settling into a chair. She introduced herself to the students around her but received polite but short responses. It was one thing to stand before the mage class in the role of an Assistant Instructor, but to sit down with students as a fellow student? They didn’t seem to know how to act. She was, after all, a Speaker, an Assistant Instructor, and a human.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzVmOTk4NmQ1NjQ3ODZiMzQ0MzJkOThjOTM5MWI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And devilishly cute.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDNjYmY2OTVlMTQxNzQ4ODQzY2FkYzM5OTlhZTY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"> “What are we doing?” she asked Kawas as the class’ background noise resumed, and Instructor Abbas continued his workshop. Amelia couldn’t help but notice she was the subject of almost all whispered gossip. It turned out her performance earlier defeating every mage in Senior Group B had gotten around, and some nicknames were already being formed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWQ3YTA2YmM5MDQyOTM4OGRmMDRjMjBmNWJiODJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Golden Terror</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> had a nice ring to it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Yjc1MTE5ZGNhZTQzNzk5ZjJiNTgyNWY1MWNhYzky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The simplest of all crystalcraft,” Kawas explained, pulling Amelia out of her eavesdropping. “Aetherlights.” The demon gestured towards the tools she’d placed in front of Amelia. “This is your callipers, chisel, eyeglass, and scoring tool. Oh, and sandpaper to grind away surface debris. Right, follow me…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTQ3YmY5ZjU0MzQ4YmU4MGQyYTMyM2RiOGJjYmY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor Kawas began explaining the fundamentals of crystalcraft to Amelia. All a moon crystal needed to act as a light source was to be cut into a specific configuration. This configuration was called the Tilburg-Cut, named after the Centralis city whose crystalers’ discovered it centuries ago. It required positioning, scoring, and then cutting the crystal into a long obelisk shape, with the ends then cut into a flat-topped pyramid. This was all that was needed to make the moon crystal glow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTM2NjczNWU0NjRmNDA4MzNmNTQ2ZThhNjM3NDY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And through Amelia’s exceptional perception, constantly enhanced by her wards, she saw why. When Amelia was transformed, she began to understand that the reason moon crystals glowed wasn’t that they generated light themselves; instead, the crystal sucked in the surrounding aether by bending the aetherfield towards itself, much like a planet bent spacetime to create the phenomenon of gravity.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTJkZmM3OGNhNjRhNGFhOTJjYzIzNjJlMzg5OGVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Building on that observation, she now learned that by cutting faces into the crystal, the shape and nature of that aether flow could be manipulated. The geometry of the crystal changed how the aether was channelled through it, and by cutting a specific configuration, the crystal could be made to generate light.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDJjODZlY2Y0MjRjZDI5MjZlMjM5MjUyMWVkYzBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The complications arose, however, because crystals weren’t perfect. Each and every sample carried imperfections. Trace amounts of material that weakened and disrupted how effectively the crystal could manipulate the aetherfield. The result was that while the Tilburg-Cut was ‘good enough’ for the majority of crystals, many of them needed custom adjustments to shine enough to be of practical use.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGEwMzhhZWFmMDRhZDJiYjFiOWRiYmE2ZGJkMjQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Most crystalers relied on their experience to produce a better aetherlight. Whether the angle between two faces needed adjusting or an entirely new face needed to be added, whatever it was, they relied on their intuition to make the change. However, Amelia wasn’t like most crystalers. When she focused, she could </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">see</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the aetherfield bending to the crystal's geometry, and before she’d gone through a dozen samples, she quickly got the hang of what area of the crystal needed some adjustment to begin working.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDc2Mzg1NTZlZDQzNGJiMDdjNzI3NDg2NzcyNDBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Samples labelled as failed attempts from previous students breathed light anew. Not only that, but her extreme dexterity allowed her to quickly understand the ins and outs of using the tools before her. Amelia became adept at knowing exactly how much force the chisel needed to be struck with. Once she understood how faces and angles changed the aetherflow, she needed little direction in positioning her chisel and making adjustments.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzZmODgyM2IyMTQyZWQ4MDFlYzM3YTNmN2ZlNGYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did you do that?” a student asked after Amelia chipped a large section of crystal from the center of the sample she was working on. It would have looked like the work of a maniac to anyone else, but Amelia knew what she was doing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjJlN2M5MTJiOTQwYTlhZDlmNTM3MGM5ZmNkMDhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The imperfection here,” Amelia explained, pointing to the upper half of her crystal. “Is blocking the aetherflow to the end. If we curve the flow around it, which we can do by cutting out what I just did, and then…” Amelia positioned her chisel, and with a quick tap, the crystal began spewing out brilliant white light. “We can save this from becoming a reject! Look at that!” Amelia held up the crystal, feeling proud of herself for saving it from failure. It would need refinement from more practised hands, but Amelia’s rough cuts had created another working aetherlight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGFkMWVjMjcyNjQ3NDY5NzJkNGI2MDExM2M0NTNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can see the aetherfield so clearly?” Instructor Kawas asked, only to shake her head when Amelia responded in the affirmative. “How lucky you are. Speakers have an advantage, don’t they? Ah…” the demon suddenly looked apologetic. “I’m sorry, Assistant Instructor Thornheart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDY3ZTE2NzM4YTQ2MWM5NmIxMDQyNTYwM2U1MWU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine,” Amelia answered, waving her hand. “It makes me wonder, though; if cutting crystals make them naturally form a light-generating formation inside themselves, then surely, in theory, every spell could be activated from a crystal cut precisely enough?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Zjk5ZWU3OGQ5ZDRkYmM4YWI4MDBlOGJkMzkyNmY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor Kawas shook her head again. “In theory, yes. But the difficulty of cutting a crystal to form even a simple spell formation is beyond our abilities. As a mage, you should recognise the difference between your spellwork and the simple light-generating formation in these crystals.” Seeing Amelia nod, Instructor Kawas continued, “Only this, along with a few others, such as the heat-generating or heat-absorbing cuts, are capable of mass production.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjdjNWM1Y2Y0NjQwY2I4YzJlNGY5YmEwMDU2Y2I1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are crystals used in cameras?” Amelia asked, remembering the flash photography she was subjected to when she arrived in Asamaywa. “When I was being photographed, the cameras gave off a hiss of steam. Was that the result of a heat-generating crystal?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzgwOTQ2MjUwMjQ4NWM4N2ZjN2M3NDcwNzgxOGJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not quite. The Tilburg-Cut can be adjusted to provide a light surge when activated. The problem is this also produces a lot of heat, enough that the camera is at risk. So, inside the camera, the crystal is kept in a container of water that evaporates when it takes a picture. That’s why you hear a hiss of steam.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjNiY2UzYWNmZjQ5YzQ4N2FiODFmYzkwYjFjZGFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…” A piece of the puzzle fell into place! “Can you show me examples of the heat-generating and heat-absorption crystals?” Amelia waited for Instructor Kawas to dig around for some samples. Unsurprisingly, the heat-generating crystal was cut from red moon crystal and the heat absorption one was cut from purple. Different moons were better or worse at producing different phenomena.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWJkMjYzMzg3MDRlYzU5NGZkYzkwMDZmMDk5MjMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This one is called the Yiannis-Cut. You can see custom adjustments here and here,” Instructor Kawas explained, pointing to different parts of the crystal. “Heat-generating formations are much more complex, and therefore, even small imperfections lead to a large loss in efficiency. Even with these adjustments, this crystal cannot generate steam. It does have some usages, such as preventing a tank of water from freezing in the winter.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjJmMGQ1NDJiOTQwYWRhZDQ4MmRiZmM2ZjAzNjQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia took the sample from Kawas and examined it, noticing that the crystal was in two pieces. Instructor Kawas explained that, like aetherlights, the final production stage was cutting the crystal in half. By doing this, you would lose some efficiency but gain the ability to activate and deactivate the effects by simply pulling apart or rotating one section of the crystal. It was a principle that would allow lights to be dimmed or allow bathwater to be kept at the right temperature.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTUwZDIwNmYwNjQxZTc5YjY0MmYzNDZkOTA0YmE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia rotated the crystal, sensing the aetherflow forming as it began to warm her hands. “Can they break from the heat?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDIwOWM5YzBmZDQ3NTdiYjk0NTkxZjg2YjNlMTAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eventually, the faces of heat-generating and heat-absorption crystals develop micro-fractures and need to be recut. If you’re lucky enough to have thousands of denarii to afford a perfect, pristine crystal, then you might be at risk of it melting. Red melts at around sixteen hundred thols,” the demon explained. “Purple melts the easiest at around nine hundred. Once a crystal melts, it loses all ability to affect aether.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjY1NDQ3MzQ5MDRhY2Y4OWRiOGFmYTlhYWY0N2M0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many thols to boil water?” Amelia asked, seeking a reference against the temperature scales she was familiar with from her world. If Instructor Kawas thought it strange that Amelia didn’t know she didn’t show it. She informed Amelia that it was a hundred thols to boil water at the continent level.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2VkMzQxN2ZlZDQzYmY5NWIzYjZhM2Y4ZjNjNjI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia continued studying the crystals. Before she knew it, the class had ended. That didn’t mean everyone left. Her prodigious talent for seeing the aetherflow meant Instructor Abbas and more than a dozen students remained to watch her work. After a while, Instructor Abbas had an idea and brought out a few boxes of heat-generating and heat-absorbing crystals deemed only worthwhile as practice items. With Amelia doing her best to explain how the aether was flowing, the remaining students could, under Abbas's instruction, put many of the crystals in working order.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDQwN2ZlZGFiZDQ4Zjk5NDdlMGY0NjM4ZjcyNGNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly, Amelia noticed that the closer she was to a crystal, the greater its effect was. This made sense, as the crystal only nudged the surrounding aether, and the atmosphere near Amelia was dense with aether due to the many layers of wards she was running. Furthermore, the aether that she was constantly pouring out to run Serena’s wards created an invisible flow that would brighten any aetherlight that happened to cross its path. It wasn’t as noticeable as it could have been; after Chesterfield’s complaints Amelia had spent some effort trying to cloak the aether in transit to Serena. She’d found some success, although it was something that she’d achieved through her intuition rather than any definitive spellwork.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzhhN2M2ZmUzYTRmZTA5MjE3MjcyOGEyN2RmZTBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, Amelia vowed to continue to work at it. She wanted to protect Serena worldwide, and it would be ideal if she could achieve that without disrupting the migratory patterns of aether-sensitive animals like arcwhales.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTZmNWJmNDU0MzQ4YWM5ZDFiOWQ2OWJiZjM2YTQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have a natural talent,” Instructor Abbas intoned, rubbing his chin as he looked over the now large pile of shining, warming, and cooling crystals. “I’ll have to ask Head Instructor Inoue whether we can borrow you in the future. If you want to know more about becoming a crystaler, stop by my office. As for now…” the demon turned to look outside the windows at the darkness beyond. “We seem to have lost track of time. Assistant Instructor Thornheart. It’s been a pleasure to have you in my class. I hope you’ll continue attending if it doesn’t conflict with your other obligations.”</span></p><span class="cjczZjMyNTk2NWY0MjQ4NjRiZmE4OWM4MDgyYjI4YjAz"><br/>Unauthorized use of content: if you find this story on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlOGViYTc0NWRmNTQ1NDFiYTI3NWQ1ZjhkZTA5NTY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm! Sure!” Amelia nodded happily. Her magical talents, along with her cuteness, had gained her another friendly contact! Even the students who were apprehensive at the start of the lecture had now become comfortable enough to chat with her as they worked. They fielded several questions to her, trying to figure out her backstory while complimenting her flawless Imperial speech. Besides vaguely mentioning that she’d spent time in Centralis after travelling from Karligard, Amelia avoided saying too much lest she accidentally commit to something contradicting the pre-agreed backstory.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODg3MzE2NjJhMjQ1YTNhMzg0ZDA1YTMyNmM2MTFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying her goodbyes, Amelia exited the workshop. Checking the direction her aether was flowing, she could see Serena was somewhere in the main building. As much as Amelia wanted to hunt down her girlfriend and see what she was up to, she had something she wanted to do first.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmU2NGViYmQxZDQ0ZjA4NGQzMThiMDdmMTA0ZjAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Continuing up the spiral staircase, Amelia came to her lodgings. What she was after wasn’t in her room but next to it. Moving to a nearby door, Amelia knocked politely and was soon greeted by the face of her assistant, Mel.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjAzNWY4ZDgzYjRmNjM4MGE1ZGUyYzljYmY3Nzc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello!” Amelia chirped the moment it was open.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjVjM2M3MWJlNDRhYWRiOGE1YjNhY2MwYmUxMTNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assistant Instructor, how-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjAyNWM2ZDE4MjQ5MTVhZWQyZDg5YjEwZGZlNzNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please,” Amelia raised a hand, interrupting the woman. “Call me Amelia.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjYzZTZlODI3ZDQzOGY4NTU5OGU2OGEzMzZiNWEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia, I see. Thank you, Assistant In-” Mel coughed lightly into her hand. “I mean, Amelia. How can I help you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Mzc1M2FhYWEzOTRlOWVhZThkMWYwNmQyNTcyMGQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you show me where the library is?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGUxZWQwZmQwMjQwNGI5MDYyMjIwOTY2NzliZjMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. It’s in the main building. Do you want to leave now?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmZlOTU3N2IxZDQ5MWQ5ZDU0N2EwYjBiMzAyMGY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded, and soon the two of them were on their way. As they walked, neither of them talked, and an awkward tension formed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWVmZGEzMWFiNDRjN2FiODhjNDFlMDg3NmFhNDFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So…” Amelia began. “I understand the uses of having you as my assistant, but what am I meant to do in return? You’re not being paid for it, are you?” Amelia knew she would feel bad if she kept making demands of Mel without giving anything in return.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzE1OGUwMjU3YzRmMjU5YTdhOWZiZTUxNGU0Nzdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Normally, if my assistance was acceptable, you might provide a letter of reference after I graduate. A Speaker’s reference would be an excellent start to my military career and might even give me a commission as a squad commander.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjMxNTI3MjYyZDRiMDk4MGNhZGE5NjJmZWI0NzBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, but is there anything I can do for this semester?” Amelia asked, prompting Mel to hesitate momentarily.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWRlMGVhMDg1ZjRiY2U4MzQ0NGExNDdhOGI2YTBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is…” The woman audibly swallowed. “Do you remember our last, uh, duel?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTc5YjUxNDVlZTQ3NTVhNWFjYjhlZjg5NGRmZWVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia did, and the mention of the event caused a twinge of guilt to form in her stomach. She’d felt terrible breaking Mel’s arm. Of course, many would say Mel deserved the consequence of picking a fight with a much more powerful person, but those people weren’t the ones who had to deal with the sickening sensation of feeling their opponent's arms break under a strike that was unintentionally too strong!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDY2ZjI4N2MzMzQzNTliYWQxMDg1MDEzNzYyZTcw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure do! I’m </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">really </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">sorry about that. How’s the arm?” Amelia asked, relying on her friendliness to hide any awkwardness she might otherwise give off.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGFjNWQzMTQ1NTQzMzRiODVjMDY5ZjUxMjY0NTg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s… fine. What I wanted to say was after those events, I promised myself I would become the best swordswoman in the East, better than my brother, better than Lord-Prospect Halen, better than Katalin of Driss!” As she spoke, her voice rose with more and more determination.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2FmMTVhNGZjMDRjMTc5YmM5MjlhNDUxNmU5ZGY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Halen,” Amelia corrected. “She was promoted recently, didn’t you hear?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjdlZjVkNTk4MjRhZDE5NzA3MjFhOTZkOTRjZDQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Yes, old habits…” Mel shook her head. “What I’m trying to say is I decided I didn’t want to settle as an average swordswoman! For that purpose, I was hoping you’d agree to duel with me perhaps… once a week? Ah…” Mel brought her thumb and forefinger close together, throwing Amelia a small smile. “But keeping the force down. Even though your healing was exceptional, it wasn’t an experience I want to repeat.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YThjMGIxNTM5NjRhOGU5NjRkZGYxMjMzYmFlOTBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia giggled before accepting Mel’s request. They made a promise to duel every weekend. Their discussion erased most of the awkwardness between them, and they were able to chat amicably as they made their way through the main building and towards the library. Amelia found out that Mel was being bombarded with questions about her. Most people were too hesitant to approach Amelia directly, but they would hassle her new assistant for information. Amelia made Mel promise to tell her if anyone got too pushy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTMwMTMxZGM4MTQ3OTVhYzNlNDZkYzEzZDZmMTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here we are,” Mel said as they rounded a large doorway into the academy's library.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjljODIxZjEwMDRkNWFhY2I1ZWVmYmJmZjE0OGQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia was stunned at what she saw. It took a moment for her to realise why; Amelia had never set foot in an actual library before. Living in a city of steel and glass, with most of her time bed-bound, she’d never had the opportunity to visit one. It didn’t help very few remained in her world. Why would they? Even the old-fashioned silicon devices from centuries past could store millions of books, let alone the more modern photoelectric devices that dominated her modern world.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjFmYWRhMThkOTRkOTg5MzRjYWRmMzExYjFmYzg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d only ever seen a traditional library through the game. Still, it was enough to ignite a fascination with the ancient world. The idea of a library was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">romantic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">: rich rugs upon creaky wooden floorboards; long hardwood bookshelves filled with dusty tomes; warm light from chandeliers coupled with a quiet atmosphere of hushed discussion between students frantically studying for the next exam.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjdmYWY4MGM5MDRjYjE5OTU2OGVjYTU4NzI0NjJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Asamaywa Academy’s library didn’t disappoint. Sure, it wasn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">quite</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as grand as the libraries from the game world, and instead of chandeliers giving a warm light, there were aetherlights, but it was a library! An actual, authentic library! Look, there was even an old librarian shushing some students!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWJkNjI3OThjNzQ3MGE4NTYyYjk1MzY4ZTM3NWY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow,” Amelia muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzkyOGRkZGZiNTRiNmNhNjdmNjU5ZGRkMDc0ZTU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel pointed out the rules regarding borrowing and returning books, as well as the associated privileges and fines she would face as a staff member. Amelia asked Mel to bring her to the mathematical section, and she was led through the rows of bookshelves. There was a method of organisation, a mixture of colours and numbers determined precisely where a book could be found - another thing she’d have to learn.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODI1YTNiYzMzZDRiNDdiNmVkODBiOTY2M2I5MDFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia perused the books. The offerings seemed slim at first glance, with perhaps a few dozen books covering mathematics. However, on one of the mornings in Kenhoro, when Tomes dropped off some mathematical workbooks, he mentioned that all the knowledge of mathematics in the Known World could be contained within a hundred volumes. That was a drop in the ocean compared to Amelia’s native world. It meant there were likely many opportunities where she could contribute. Theorems that were brushed over in a few minutes in a lecture in the online courses she’d attended would be ground-breaking revelations here.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjQ0OTMxMWQ2YTQ1OGE5MWVmZTlhY2MzNjA5YWRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia picked a few books covering subjects she felt most at home with. With only a few suspicious glances from the stuffy-looking librarian, who looked like she’d rather anyone other than a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> take out her precious books, Amelia checked out the books and left the library.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWMyNTcyYmY0MjQ2MTRiN2FmZmFlMzJhYjExNWQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She planned to return to her room, drop off the books and then find Serena, but Mel said she’d take the books herself. Amelia obliged, handing off all but one. The thin book’s title had caught her eye: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mathematics of War</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It would be her reading material for the night.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzAwYmM4M2Q4ZTQzYmVhNjk4NGFhNTQ5YjQxYmFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Waving Mel off and with the book in hand, Amelia tracked down Serena. It was an easy task; all she had to do was follow the aether leaving her body. Before long, she found herself outside Serena’s quarters.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzM3ZWM3NTYyOTQzNDRiODBlNjZmNzE0NjM1YjUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought it was you,” Serena said upon opening her door and seeing Amelia. “Can I help?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjBkYTFkOTRiMDRmMTdhN2RkY2U1N2I1ZDQxNDdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, uh, was hoping for some advice regarding my swordsmanship.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmM2MWM3NWQ2NzQ1ZTZiMGNkN2Y3ZTk1YTI0Yjk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena stared at Amelia for a long moment before leaning out the doorway and looking down both ends of the corridor. “Come in, then,” she finally said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDQwMzU2NTI5NTRkMWNhOTEzODBjYWM2MTllMzdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia stepped into Serena’s room. After the door was closed behind her, she followed her usual habit of casting a sound-blocking ward. “Wow,” Amelia said, looking around. “My place is much nicer. You should come visit, have some tea…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODk1MTJlYTc4MzRkMzA4MTFlYThjNTRkN2EyYjMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Swordsmanship training?” Serena intoned sarcastically, crossing her arms. “Couldn’t you have come up with a better excuse? You don’t even have a sword on you! How long are you planning to stay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDc1MmE5MDg1ODQzOWU4MWRkNDYwYzNlZmIyOTIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wasn’t planning on leaving,” Amelia said with a grin. “Where’s your bedroom, through here?” Ignoring Serena’s sudden protest, Amelia opened a nearby door and saw a comfortable-looking bed with a suspicious arrangement of blankets and pillows.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjM0MTc3NmI3OTQ3ZDU4YWZjOWU5YjI2ZWI0YjJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my,” Amelia raised a hand to her mouth in mock surprise, unable to keep the smugness out of her voice. “Is that supposed to be a replacement for me?” She turned to find Serena thoroughly red-faced, looking to the side.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDZhYjRmNTg3NTRmOGQ4YTYxNGM5NDVhZDdlMDkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I’ve become accustomed to your… warmth. Damn it!” Serena kicked the doorway. “This is your fault! If you weren’t so… so…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWUzYzE5YWQxNTQ4MzJiOWYwMjU4MGI0NWRkNDM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Devilishly attractive and extremely cuddly?” Amelia asked, widening her eyes to form a look of innocence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTM2OGRlMjhhMTRkODdiZjEzNTIyM2MwMTlhYjc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Idiot!” Serena reached out, ruffling Amelia’s hair. “Because of you, I now have…” Her voice became quiet, the last bit barely audible even to Amelia’s senses. “...needs.” Serena groaned, grabbing her horns while looking upwards and muttering, “I was managing just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fine, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and then you appear for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">two minutes,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and I become like this! Damn, damn, damn…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjUwZmI4MGE5ZTQzYzA5MWFmYjIzNzhlNjVjZTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia giggled before skipping over and launching herself onto the bed. “Well, don’t mind me. I’m just here for some light reading. It’s lonely in my room.” Amelia waved the book at Serena. “What are you up to?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTJiYmY3M2Q4YjQwZTY5NTM3NjdhZmE1NDU5YWIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahem! I’m writing a lecture plan,” Serena explained, recovering slightly from her prior awkwardness. “I’ve been asked to explain the Port Highwind operation. How we approached it, why we chose to do what we did…” Serena shrugged. “What about you? Everyone’s talking about your duel with Instructor Inoue. I see you chose </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the end. Are you planning on Speaking another?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTdjNTU2OGFmMjRmZTA5ZTYwYzIyMzA3OTg4NzQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe,” Amelia replied, stretching like a cat on the bed. She quickly explained the events that transpired regarding Senior Group B, as well as the positive impression she made during Instructor Abbas’s Crystalcraft workshop. All in all, Serena responded positively to the idea of Amelia taking on a few disciples. She explained that learning to teach would be a great learning experience for Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGQ1ZGM1ZDIxMzRkZDY4N2M2NjgxYWQ5ZWFiNTAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what do you want to do now?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTdlZWUwZWUwMDQ0NWE4M2JlMWQ4N2IxZDBlODc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s blush returned and she took a half-step forward before stopping and shaking her head. “I need to finish this plan. Then we can… do other things.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODg3MDc0NDFhODRlMWM5OTA2MmUyMDlkMzJkM2Y2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, Amelia couldn’t help but giggle. Serena was so easy to read. Amelia sat up on the bed and patted the mattress next to her. “Come work here. You can do your writing, and I can read, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjA1OGJlYzdkMDQ4NmZiMTkzYzVhOGJhYzdhNjUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Fine,” Serena muttered. She vanished and soon reappeared with paper and pen. The demon hesitated only a little before climbing onto the bed as if she was worried Amelia would do something the moment she got too close.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmMyOGNiY2QwYTRlN2NhYzMxN2M0YjU2YzMxY2Fk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia began reading. At least, she pretended to. While Serena scratched away at her work, Amelia spent her time focusing on her girlfriend's movements. It didn’t escape her senses that Serena kept pausing to glance at her legs, and when she rotated to the side, her back facing Serena, she could feel her girlfriend’s gaze on her arse.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGMwNTg5YmFjOTQ0YzM5Yzk0Y2YwMDJiY2JlY2Ni" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">So predictable.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTI5NTAxNmJmNzRmZjhiOGYyNDUwNTc1MTJiNjZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia yawned, complaining that the room was too hot. She removed her outer layer of clothing and positioned herself on her belly, pretending to read while lightly moving her feet in the air. After a minute of being a distraction, she muttered that it was still too hot and removed her trousers, leaving her only in her undershirt and pants.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjlmNDBjMzk1NTQyMzJiMDdhNDBhOTI0ZmFhMTI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know what you’re doing,” Serena said flatly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGQxZmQ1NzY2NjQ1MTdhYWMyOTFhMDE0MjAxN2Y4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzNkNjczYTkxZjQ3OWNhMWI4ODJlYzAxNzZjYTNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing. Stop talking.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmM4ZjA4MzgxMjRhNTlhMzlhZGNjZmI2NTZjNzVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re the one who said something!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODRiNjRmOTYxYjQxMWI5NDA1ZDk3NmJmZmY5YjA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWMzNGRhOWMwYTQ0OWJiNzVmZmRhMmQzOWU1NjQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Half naked, Amelia hummed while flicking through the pages of her book. Serena had long stopped writing, and Amelia knew if she looked up from her book, her girlfriend would either be glaring daggers at her or rolling her eyes. Whichever it was, it would be accompanied by flushed cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2Y0NmU2ODY0OTRhMzRiYzk5ZDIyYzU5ZDBmNTUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still so bloody hot!” Amelia exclaimed, doing her best to act frustrated. Reaching back, she pulled her undershirt off and, acting as nonchalantly as possible, unhooked her bra. “Aren’t you hot?” She asked Serena as she rotated her body so her bare back touched her girlfriend’s arm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTBjNWZmNWY1OTRlMjhhNzZmZTg1Zjc0MWVkNGEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was too much for the demon, who yelled, “Seven hells! You’re incorrigible!” Pen and paper were thrown aside, and Amelia felt herself forcefully adjusted so she was lying on her back. Serena clambered on top of her, her face bright as a tomato, but the brashness of the situation didn’t stop her girlfriend from leering at Amelia’s topless body.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTEwYTVlMTllMTQ2ZjE5ZGY4NTJiYTIzZWJhNmUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s gotten into you so suddenly?” Amelia asked, unable to keep herself from smiling.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDczYmZkMWE1YTRmMjZhZDhkYjU4YjZhYTVhODE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You!” Serena exclaimed in frustration. One of Serena’s hands pinned down Amelia’s wrist above her head while the other was brazenly groping one of her breasts. “Making me so… so…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDAxODY4ZmI4NDQ3Nzc5Njk4ZmVkYTFkZmFlMTU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Horny?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2JiN2YwZjFhYjQ0MGE4MzQxOTM0YWMyN2Q5ODEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop saying weird things!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Zjc3Zjg4Y2M5YzRlOTU5ZGExMDBhMjVlMmVmOWNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not my fault you demons reference your horns in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">every </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">idiom ever made, yet you’ve never come up with the expression </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">horny</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. That’s weird!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjM4Y2ZiMTdlNDQ5MmQ4YzEwNzIzNjIyZGY1ZWMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s weird that humans reference horns to communicate their… their…” Serena tutted. “Just say </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">aroused</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> like a normal person!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjZiNTI5MWE3NjQxZTliODI5ZWI0OGViYjgxMTQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then!” Amelia chirped. “Are you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjI5ODM5NWE4MzRkNjliNTUyNTA3MjdkYzRkYzJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Am I what!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzNjODBlODcyMTQ4ZGFiZjI4YmEyNjRkMGVhZDcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aroused?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODI4ODFkZTFiYTQ2Y2M4MTI3ZGIxYzZhY2Y1M2Iw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I am, you fool!” Serena leaned forward, aggressively stealing a long and passionate kiss. Amelia fumbled awkwardly, eventually managing to undress Serena. It wasn’t until they were both entirely naked that Serena’s hand left Amelia’s breasts and went below to a far more pleasurable area.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTdmMWY4ZGFmYTQ0ODQ5ZTVhMmNmMzg3NTM1Yjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m the luckiest human alive,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia thought as she moved closer and closer to the inevitable satisfying explosion.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmRkNzZkYjFmMzQ1Mjg4MTEwMTEzOGI3YTExZThj" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever the future may bring, these moments made it all worth it.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNmMGQ5Y2FmN2UyZjQxYjZiNjMxYjQzMjg3MDM0Yzc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWQ3YTVlMzc4ZDQ3MGJhZWZiZjNkYmNhNTA1ZWQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena woke at first light. She didn’t open her eyes just yet, instead choosing to enjoy the warm pressure of Amelia leaning into her. It was unbelievable how difficult it was to maintain composure around her. At first, she accepted it as the result of a fledgling infatuation, but in many ways, it only got worse. Was this what it felt like to be madly in love? As the days and weeks ticked by, Serena not only began factoring Amelia into more and more decisions, but she’d also begun working on the assumption they would always be together.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjBmY2U0OGQ4NjQ2YjlhZjAwMDM5Nzk5YjMwMmZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">An assumption that made Serena giddy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjNmOTk2NTQ4ODQ4ZjZiM2E3MTVhMzcwMGM1ZDdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She wrapped an arm around Amelia’s sleeping figure and gave her a small squeeze. Her action earned her a satisfying squeak and something mumbled about fried chicken. Serena slipped out from under the blanket and stood up, quietly yawning as she regulated her aura to resist the morning chill. She glanced through the window and was greeted by a frosty, foggy morning. Turning away, she-</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGQ1NWY3OGY0ZDQzNjM5YzI3OWNjMjRhNGM2MDhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, what was that?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzE5YWE4ZGQ0OTRiOTE5OTVlMjdmZmVlZmU4MTFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena snapped her gaze back out the window. She eyed the suspect corner, where she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">swore</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she had just seen someone watching her. There was no one there. Serena pushed through orange and into yellow aura, enhancing her perception as much as she could without Speaking. While her senses now informed her of a few dozen aether signatures around the academy, there was no sign of the person who had been watching her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjA1NjYzNzc3YjQ3YzBhMWJhOGY0ODMyZDdiODVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it just a coincidence?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDU2ZjNjYzRjMTQ0YmZhY2U4YTljYzAyMjJlM2Qy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We being attacked?” a mumbling and sleepy Amelia asked, not even turning around. “Or are you training?” With an exaggerated yawn, the blond-haired mess slowly moved onto her back. “It’s so early!” she exclaimed suddenly before reaching out with one hand, gesturing at Serena. “Ren… come back to bed. It’s so cold and lonely without you…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWY0ODkzMzU5ZjQwMGVhZDkwM2I2MDUwZDVmYTdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The invitation brought a smile to Serena’s face. She approached the sleepy Amelia, letting her aura drop to its usual red hue before kissing her girlfriend’s forehead. “I thought I saw something,” she explained. “But we need to get up anyway. You need to slip out before anyone sees you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWYxNTdjNGZmZjQyNzA4YmZmMjI0ZmU2ZjU5ZTlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…” Amelia reached and took hold of Serena’s hand, pulsing a subtle healing spell into them both. At least Amelia possessed enough awareness now to know that if she blasted her magic here, it would announce to half the academy that she was in Serena’s room. The familiar golden warmth filled Serena, revitalising her for the day ahead and washing away any sleepiness. Amelia continued their morning ritual by casting her cleaning spell on them both, erasing any sweat from their bodies and removing the need to use the toilet in the morning.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDBkYTUzYzQ0YzQxNmY5NmI1YzE1YTkzMTUwNDQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’m awake now,” Amelia chirped, sitting up and looking around the room. “Coffee?” she asked, pointing towards a small gas stove. The main academy building hadn’t been modernised fully. While it replaced the old gas lamps with aetherlights, the gas lines remained in use.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmM3NWQzYWVhOTQ0MmFhMDFlYzBlNmE0MDA5MmQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure,” Serena filled a kettle, struck a match and lit the stove. “Some of your Jimari beans,” she gestured towards a small pot. She’d taken the liberty to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">borrow</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> some of Amelia’s stash from the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. After her girlfriend had bought a ridiculous twenty-pound bag of the stuff - a luxurious expense Serena would never do herself - she’d found that she’d become accustomed to the quality coffee over the military rations she was used to. “Mind brewing while I wash?” she called out, heading to the washroom. With Amelia’s cleaning magic, washing wasn’t necessary; it was simply a habit Serena enjoyed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjNiYjRlOWZjODRlNmVhMzNkMDc0YzBlZmE2OWNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After washing and dressing, Serena returned to the bedroom to find two steaming cups of coffee waiting for her. “What are your plans for today?” she asked, sipping the black liquid and enjoying the bitter sensation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWE0YWVjYmFhMDRiMTY4MzExNTc1M2FiZGFhODhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…” Amelia closed her eyes, seemingly focusing on remembering her schedule. “I’m free till lunch, then there’s a first-year magic class Lunaria wants me to attend, but only to observe how they teach. Oh, that reminds me! Since when was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis’s Downpour</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a seventh-circle spell?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGVhNzdkZGI5MDRkMmM5YmFiMzliZTgyODc4MWI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know exactly. Maybe a few centuries?” Serena offered. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was close to becoming a Second-Word god. Even now, the aether required to commune his name as a First Word was so much he was one of the rarest Words out there. It was estimated that within a few decades, maybe another century, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> would make his first </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">embodiment</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and officially move higher up the divine ladder. Serena explained this to Amelia and finished with, “He’s sort of considered a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">one-point-five</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Word.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzRiODRmNmM2ZTRmYzRiODBhMzE1OWY2ZjMxZWM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guess that explains it,” Amelia nodded, sipping her coffee. “I almost killed Lunaria yesterday with it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWM0YjIwM2E4NDRhM2RiOGExZTdjYTg0MjBiZDJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah,” Serena uttered. “That’s how the roof got damaged?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGM5MGI4OWE3MTQwMTA4Y2M4NzUwMjBiZDk0MmJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOWJlNmM1NDk4NDQwNzBiNjYxZGRiZjI2MWM4YjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2IzM2ViZjY3MDRkYzJhNDNjYmVlN2M1ZWQyOWFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjIwZWUwNWFhMjQ1NDM4OTU5NGFjMTIwOTk4NmVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They sat in silence for a moment, enjoying the morning. After their coffee was almost finished Amelia said, “Sarafina knows I Spoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, and I suspect Lunaria also knows. I think a lot of them know, to be honest.” She shrugged and added, “I didn’t confirm it directly, but I can’t deny it…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmE5YzQwYjcyMzRlZjE4OTNjZjM2N2IzZjJiZDhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena nodded slowly. If there was one major fault with Amelia, it was how difficult it was for her to deceive others. She could do it a little, but anyone half-trained could pick up her body language and know what was truthful and what wasn’t. “I imagine it’ll be officially announced soon. They’re probably drip-feeding information to get a feel on the response.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWQwNTZiZmNjNDQ4NWI5MDY0YzFmZGVlZDA5ZTdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of all nations, the response of Christdom was the most important. Had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> informed the Vatican of Amelia’s embodiment of his divinity? </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was, like the other human gods, aligned with the human race. After all, there was a reason they were called the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> gods. But there were rules and accords in the halls of divinity that transcended the racial politics of the Known World. It was entirely possible that after Amelia had, in her own words, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">told off</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the lower rung of demonic gods through some mysterious way of Speaking, divine arrangements had been made regarding her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTcxOTlhYTVmZjRkYjQ4NzczMzliMjNjZTE2ODdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, who was Serena to start guessing what happened in the Seven Hells or the Six Heavens?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDMwNTRmYmRiMDRjMWI5NDNjNmVhN2Q4MTc4YjZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gah!” Amelia groaned. “I should have picked one of the demonic Second-Word gods to save the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakamoto</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. They’re far more fun!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTNlNmM0YTUxODQxODRhMTk4YzJhMGIxOTZhNWFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena snorted. Despite Amelia’s growth, she still said ridiculous things. Even knowing Amelia’s circumstances, it was strange to hear her talk about picking a Second-Word as if she were plucking fruit from a tree. A Second-Word was a lifelong goal of the most talented and dedicated demons. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWY5MGU2ZDEyYzRjMDE5M2MyMDBhZmQyYjlkZjQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” Amelia questioned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTY4MzkwYjEzZDRlZThhZTc1NTgzYTg5YzI2N2Q2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just happy to have such a capable girlfriend,” Serena mused, nursing her cup of coffee. Amelia’s cheeks flushed. Serena knew Amelia loved being referred to as her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">girlfriend</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Hells, Serena enjoyed it too, especially as it was one of the few things she could use to make Amelia giggle and blush. “You were reading that last night. What is it?” she asked, pointing to the book Amelia had brought.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWIyNTQzNjI5NjQ5NDc5NWVlMjNlODZjNmU5OWE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mathematics of War,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Amelia said, turning the book so Serena could see. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmZhMTRhODk5MzQyYWM5MDljNzQwMDE5NDNmNThk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a familiar book. One she’d studied during her time at the academy. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">The</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mathematics of War</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> reformed many military processes. The anonymous author greatly influenced the thinking of Centralis with its commentary on the Cascadia-Republic conflict in its early stages. It argued that technological advances meant war would become bloodier, not quicker and that Cascadia should prepare for long, grinding wars of attrition that prioritised destroying the enemy instead of taking territory. When it was written, the conflict hadn’t yet become the quagmire it was today, where Republican efforts only persisted due to countless resources and ‘volunteers’ being funnelled into the country by the human nations. Thankfully, the reforms it suggested were carried out years ago and meant that Cascadia could constrain most of the fighting off the Cascadian continent.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDY1ZjI5ZmQ4ODQ4MzE5YTEwNjVhYjdlYzZhNDZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did you think of it?” Serena asked. Amelia wasn’t military-minded, but some of the weapons she’d mentioned were shocking. Torpedoes that could travel thousands of kilometres, hugging the terrain guided by their machine brains aided by human creations that orbited the planet. She didn’t think Amelia was pulling her horn, but Serena simply couldn’t fathom how the handheld machines Amelia described could do millions of calculations a second.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzc4M2I3MTA3OTQwZDdhMWE5MmEyZDdlYWI3ZDk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know,” Amelia replied, shrugging. “I wasn’t actually reading it. I was more focused on teasing you! Hey! No hair ruffling!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDkwNTgyNzJiYjQ1MzViMDFhNWM3ODJmZDU3Y2Vh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman’s complaints were left unanswered as her golden hair was thoroughly ruffled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWY5MWVhMmY2ODRiZjI5NjE5MTVkNmQwODU2ZjY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you?” Amelia asked as she fixed her hair. “What are you doing? Can we meet up later?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTk2ZjY4ZmRiYTRmMWRhZWI3NWZlMWZiMDhiOGE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Katalin of Driss runs an instructor-only training session on Wednesday mornings. That’s where I’m heading. Did you want to come?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWY0ODZmZTAwZTQ3NjJiM2JjNDJiODc1MTMyOGUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh,” Amelia hesitated for a moment, a look of indecision on her face. “Sure!” she suddenly exclaimed. “Maybe she’ll have some insights on me breaking into red aura!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWQ0YTU2YjQ3ZjQ1OWY5MTIxOTI0MWFhMmY3YmY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That's good. It saves you from needing to sneak out. If anyone sees us, we can pretend you came first thing to me so I can take you to the session.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWRiMjgwNGU5MzQ2NGQ5OGYwNDFhZDBlZTMzNWM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That excuse became useful sooner rather than later. Shortly after leaving Serena’s quarters, they crossed paths with Ryosuke Yamamoto. Serena greeted the demon, explaining her role as Amelia’s guide. Luckily, he didn’t seem to give it a second thought. As they got closer to their destination, Serena felt an unfamiliar bubble of anxiety form. Was it because this would be the first time she trained with her fellow instructors? Or was it perhaps the fact that something about the northern demon set her on edge?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzczYzZmOTE4MzRlZGRiM2NiMGU0NzAxZTdmOGUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of sessions does she run?” Serena asked Ryosuke.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODdhNjUyNWJhMjQ0ODRiODUxMDBlZGQ1ZjMyN2Qz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The first half is relatively standard, although at a much higher pace than what we put the students through. Then, most instructors leave, unable to cope with the second half of the session where she…” The demon warrior’s eyes narrowed, his brow furrowing. “...She mostly just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">destroys </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">us.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTE5NzMzMGIzODQ3MzM5MmU4ZjIwYzYxMDM3NmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that sounds awfully ominous!” Amelia exclaimed. “Why do you keep coming back?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTk1OGViNGE4NzQ1ZDk5Y2YxZjQ5ZTFmOGUyZTg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s your warrior spirit, Assistant Instructor Thornheart?” Ryosuke’s eyes gleamed. “How can we resist? She’s as talented as the rumours say, and it feels as though no matter how much we try, she’s always there to match us. Not just with the sword either; she wields the spear just as well! Katalin swore she'd privately tutor those who last a month, so a few of us are fighting for that privilege.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzE1Nzg5NzNjMDQ4MDE4Zjg4OTZhYWM4MjQ2MDE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They arrived at the training hall. From within, Serena could hear the muffled sounds of clashing metal. “Steel, not wood?” she asked Ryosuke with a raised eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTM3OWI1NWFjZTQyYzNhNzMxMzNjNjA5MGQyNDc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s how she wants it,” came the reply. “Oh, and one last bit of advice: if she asks you to attack her, then </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">attack her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGExZjNkMDZkMjQ0MmI4YTViMDVkMmMwN2M2YTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena nodded. Ryosuke opened the door, and the three of them stepped in. Inside, two dozen instructors and assistant instructors were warming up. Perhaps half of the warrior side of the teaching academy was present, the value of Highlord Driss’s teaching outweighing the painful early mornings.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODFlMmFiMDQwYTQxMjJhMmRhNDE1NTc5OGU1MmU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the centre, the demon in question stood. “One minute!” Katalin called out before locking her purple eyes with Serena and then Amelia. Serena watched Katalin’s expression closely, looking for any signs of anger or hatred. The North did not like humans, and Katalin’s comments from the last time they met suggested the demon didn’t vary from the norm. Serena didn’t want to cause conflict, but if anyone started to bully Amelia, she’d have to step up, no matter the complications it caused.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGUzOTE0NmVmMTRjNTVhZTBmOWJlYTY4Mzc5MWQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Other than a slight narrowing of the eyes, Serena couldn’t decipher much from Katalin’s expression. The demon slowly turned her gaze away followed shortly by the other members of staff that had been gawking in their direction. Serena recognised a few others: the muscular Nathaniel Endo, the Head of the Department of Combat Training; Kenji Tanaka, the Head of Tactics and Strategy; Joey Ito, the Head of the new Department of Physical Training. The rest of the pack seemed to tilt mainly to the Department of Combat Training, which wasn’t at all unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTJhY2FiNGU0NDRjYTk5N2M5Nzk5Y2NkNTBkZGY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here,” Serena said, fetching two swords and handing one to Amelia. “Does this feel okay?” Seeing Amelia nod, she leant in and whispered, “Keep your wards up. And, uh…” She leaned in further. “Stick with me when you can. Don’t be afraid to demonstrate raw power against anyone who disrespects you. You are the Head of your own House now. An insult to you means far more than it did previously. And besides…” Serena felt a smile form. “You can just heal any limbs you chop off, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmE2MmUwOWI5NzQwZDQ4NjY5ZDY0MTQ0YTM1OTFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-right!” Amelia clenched a fist, prompting another smile from Serena. Amelia had difficulty with the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">finesse</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of combat, lagging behind experienced aura users, but if she abandoned accuracy and any attempts to defend, she could swing her ward-infused weapon with enough force to obliterate anything in her path.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDI1N2NhYzJmMjQyZGE5MWQzYTc2N2I4ODRmOGVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Line up!” Katalin suddenly called out. The room scrambled into ordered rows with absolute obedience. The atmosphere was strangely tense. Serena felt like she was a first-year again, where she felt dread and anticipation lining up in her first-ever formal class. This time, seasoned instructors were the students, and the instructor was a martial genius who seemed to meet every expectation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGIzNjRkOTA4YTRmMjlhY2JlZGFlZmIyZTBlMDdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Start running! Keep those auras high!” The order came, and the group began running laps around the room while pushing themselves to mostly yellow aura, with a few assistant instructors only managing orange. Every ten seconds or so, Katalin would shout out, “Flare!” and everyone would start flaring their aura as much as they could. A few seconds would pass and Katalin would yell, “Relax!”, and the flaring would end.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWFmYTcyMGQ2YTQ1MWZhYjQ3OTk5YTFlNmMzMzQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the exception of Amelia, of course. Just as Serena wondered what she should do instead, Katalin fell into line alongside them. “Human,” she said. The northerner glanced at Serena before correcting herself. “Assistant Instructor Thornheart. You are perhaps the first human mage I’ve ever taught.” Katalin turned her head, shouting into the room, “Flare!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjZmZGVkMzliNDRiZDdhNmRjMjU0Mjk2MTE2YzIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm…” Amelia seemed not to know how to reply.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmZkMWIwNjg5ZTRiNGNiMDAzNDM0M2Y4N2I0MGE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are yet to reach the first colour, yes?” Katalin asked. Without waiting for an answer, she asked, “Have you learned to cycle your aether like a warrior? It is different from the mage, yes? It is within the body, like a convection current. Not outside.” Katalin then shouted, “Relax!”.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZThhMDg4NDA1NTQ1MDZiZmYzYTU5ZGJmMmZhMzU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia answered. “I learned it recently. I-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzliZDZiN2Q2NDRkZDFiNDkyYmFhYzZjNzAzMDVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do that then. Accelerate the aether when everyone else flares, yes? When we conduct drills, match your wards with the level of aura called for. Understand? I see you’re protecting Instructor Halen, but can you also ward your weapon?”</span></p><span class="cjMzNDllMDY4ZGIxMDQ5OWQ4ZWIwYzIzNDQyZTBhY2Nh"><br/>Did you know this story is from Royal Road?

<p class="cnM3YmZmMmY5MzVlNjQyNzhhNzc3YzVjNjdiMmQ2ODMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, yes!” Amelia hesitatingly answered. Without saying anything further, Katalin jogged ahead as the group continued their rhythmic warm-up. Katalin continued to call out orders for a few more minutes, and Serena would quickly flare and cool her yellow aura. Perhaps it was because she felt out of place in the room or the fact a legendary figure was teaching her, but Serena pushed her aura harder than usual and, as a result, found herself out of breath by the time Katalin called for them to stop.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzljOWUzMjg2YzRjZDM4ZjI5MWQ3NmE3N2ZhMGVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pace yourself,” someone next to her she didn’t recognise mumbled. “It doesn’t get any easier.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzA0MTdiNjA0OTRiNWViNzliNzUwMDliNGM3Mjdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That person was, for better or for worse, correct. Katalin took the group through the stance and strike she’d used against Serena the day before. Arms raised high with the sword poised to strike down. Stomach bent in, away from the enemies' reach. It was a killing strike designed to break the enemy's defence. Serena felt she would be better off carrying a club than a sword. The brutal way of striking was ferocious and practical, but felt foreign to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shimokan</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> way.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDBkZTIxMzdhOTRhOGZhMDI3ZjY3ZWU4NDI5YzE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena couldn’t help but glance at Amelia. The woman was devoted to the task at hand, her face creased with concentration. For some reason, Amelia seemed more able to focus now than Serena. Was she worrying too much about Amelia?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWJlNWQ3ZGM4YTRmNjk4NjUwYTM1ODA4MWFkNDA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Two lines! Facing each other! Go!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2E5MDNlMTlkODQxYTZhM2EzYzM3ZjZlZjZkZDA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The group scrambled to align themselves. Serena faced Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmY0YTJlZDkxZTQyYjE4NjU2MDc0ZDMwNjYwMDUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Three-step aura stepping! Use the strike you just practised! Defenders try and block or parry! My side attacks first! Begin!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGU2ZTk5MDEwODQyOGRhYjE5MjMzNjBmOTdhNTY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena quickly bowed to Amelia, who followed suit. “Take a step back every time I attack forward. Three attacks, like I taught you,” Serena whispered quickly. Amelia nodded, bracing herself. Serena cooled her aura down to red. She took her ready stance, her muscle memory naturally taking her into </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hachiji-dachi</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> before she quickly adjusted from the shimokan stance to the one Katalin had demonstrated.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTU1NmI3NWFkZDQ0ODI5NTkxMDM4YzMwZmE4OGU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena stepped forward, not wanting to fall too far behind, striking down hard with her red aura. Then, pausing only momentarily to move her aura into orange, she stepped forward to attack again with even more force. Taking a little more time, she pushed her aura into the final yellow, and taking a third step forward, she brought down her sword against Amelia’s defence with such power that she was surprised her girlfriend didn’t buckle.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjM4MzQ2NTUxNTQzNTA5YzQwYWNkODliZTY4OTky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The training in Kenhoro had really paid off.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWU5OWM0Y2JhMjQ2OTc4ZWJlZmNhMGNiZDE0MzI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, it was Amelia’s turn.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzA5NzRjZGRjMjRiNDg4YjgyZjE4MTNmMGU3ZTEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember the testing we did,” Serena mumbled. Amelia looked confused for a moment before her eyes widened with understanding. Amelia’s standards were several times higher than what everyone else was used to. Her first circle magic held up against third aura attacks, or, in their previous experimentation, a barrage of four-inch explosive shells. Likewise, her first circle enhancements she maintained at all times were likely sufficient to smash straight through Serena’s red aura, as much as she hated to admit it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWY2ZjgyNDE3MjRhNDU4NzRiMmM4YmIwNzgwODRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her girlfriend was just too strong!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDg4YWI0ZTg5ODRjZDViNjVmZDU3ZTdmOThlNWE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, Amelia understood what she had to do. When Amelia took her three steps forward, striking first with her blade wrapped in first circle wards, then second circle, and finally third, she kept the power in check enough not to embarrass Serena. There was a tentative nervousness to Amelia’s strikes, which Serena understood all too well. Training with steel weapons instead of wooden swords had a psychological effect. She remembered her first practice duel with steel, where she finally began to understand she was wielding a weapon to kill.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTk3NDExMTQzYzRkMTNiODgwOWVjNzc2ZWViYjhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My side move right!” Katalin ordered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDIxMDI0YjVkMzQ3ZGM5ZGJkYjRjMjI4N2FhYzI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena took a few steps to her right, facing a new opponent. The person at the very end of their line ran to the other side to fill the newly vacant spot. It was a familiar method of training. Line up in pairs, conduct a drill, and then cycle through the entire line. It was a quick and efficient way of getting practice against dozens of opponents.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTJhYTU4MDM1MzQ0MjE4YjRmNWNjZmE1OTI0ZWQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The pace at which Katalin went, though, was surprising. Aura stepping drills were designed to train the individual's ability to push into the next colour. However, when coupled with the devastating power carried out by the northern strike at the required cadence, many became exhausted before completing the drill against a dozen opponents.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGJhYTcxY2EwYzQ4Y2RiNzQzNzk4ZTE0NGMxNGJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s opponent fell to their knee after failing to push themselves back into yellow. She helped them up. Her opponent thanked her, before graciously excusing themselves where they half-rested and half-collapsed against the wall. Considering how no one seemed to raise an eyebrow at the event, Serena figured it was a common occurrence. The assistant instructors gave up first, and not long after, a few instructors had to step out. By the time Serena faced Amelia again, Serena was sweating heavily, her body ached, and she felt that odd burning sensation you only experience when you exhaust your body's ability to handle aether.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGI0YjUwNjI4MzQ5Njk4MzZmOTY0NjA4MWQyOTUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t look so great…” Amelia mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzIxNjBmMWUzYjRlMjZiOTEwMzA5OGMxNzcyYzhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Two minutes rest!” Katalin called out to a collective groan of relief from the group who hadn’t yet collapsed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzRkMWVkNjhiYzQzMWZhOTdlNGEyMjE4ODljODA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia was sweating and red-faced, but it was clearly from the physical toll. She had no signs of aether exhaustion. This hadn't gone unnoticed by the other staff members, who mumbled amongst themselves that Amelia’s spellwork was some of the quickest they’d ever seen. Typically, mages avoided close combat; their wards weren’t as strong as aura, and it took too long for their spell formations to form against an opponent within reach. On the other hand, Amelia was talented beyond her fellow mages and could establish and teardown formations as quickly as her opponent could step forward and swing their sword.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzhmMGFiOWU3NTQxZmE4OThiYTUwYTNlZmJjMzI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine,” Serena waved her hand. “I just need some water…” She’d barely begun looking when Ryosuke appeared, handing her a bottle.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWE2NTI3MjFjYTRlNmI5OGY1NDMwYzM5MmY1NzBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tough, isn’t it?” he said with a grin. “No one would blame you for sleeping the rest of the day off. As for you, Assistant Instructor Thornheart, you’ve single-handedly made me reconsider whether mages might be able to be squad commanders. How in the seven hells do you create your formations so quickly? Especially while keeping Instructor Halen’s wards running?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTYxZGJjYzRhMjQyMjI5MDFhNjFmMTE2YjdhYmUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, uh,” Amelia began, taking Serena’s bottle and sipping it. “Practised a lot, I guess?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmNmMmU0YTYxYjQ5YWJhNmQ3YWVhZTZjNmUxYmNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some practise…” came the reply.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWQ4YzMxYTA0OTQyZGNhZWZiZTU4Yzk1MDNkYWFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many make it to the second half?” Serena asked, feeling better now her breathing had calmed down.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTllYzQ2NTMyMTRlODNhZGFmY2VlMWNmOTU0ZmRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Normally? Only me, Joey, and Nathaniel.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjc5ZTlmOTg4YjQxNzA4NWU1NmQ4ZTRkMTJkZTA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So few?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWQ3NmYwNjQzOTQ5ZDM4MDA1YWI2OTBjMWFhOWM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there were others, but they couldn’t keep up. Most know their limits. What about you?” Ryosuke’s eyes sparkled. “Think you’ll stay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzQyNzI5M2U2MDQzNTdhZmI4YjRhMGM4ODM3NDA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll try.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDZlOWNhZmQ0NDQxOTY5NDZkYzU1YzQ2NjAyZWRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you want me to heal either of you?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTBhNzJkN2U1ZTQ5NjY5YmVlYTI1YjYwMDU5ZmUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No healing!” Katalin shouted. She strode up to the three of them, glaring at Amelia. “Muscle needs to be stressed to grow! Iron needs to be hot before it can be forged! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Warriors</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> need to fight at their limits! Understand?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWIyY2I0Mjg3YzQwNjdiMGY0YzgzOGEzZjk0NDI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite Katalin’s disapproving expression, Serena again failed to find any signs of actual hatred. Was Katalin just good at hiding it? Serena hadn’t forgotten that Katalin informed her she might be considered a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">traitor</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the North for associating herself with Amelia, so she had no illusion regarding Katalin’s general attitude towards the human race. Yet, Serena suspected that Katalin’s famed obsession with swordsmanship might be just slightly stronger than her dislike of humanity. Did the northerner have a little bit of respect for Amelia for showing up to learn? Katalin was powerful beyond Serena’s talent, which was already considered exceptional for her age. Being so capable, how much of Amelia’s power could Katalin see?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTVkZjJhZDkwMjQ1MDY5NzAxZTMyZDhiOWIwODlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Back in line!” Katalin shouted, pulling Serena out of her thoughts. She, along with everyone else, scrambled back into position. The purple-eyed demon paced down the line before stopping in front of Ryosuke. She then took several steps back, out of the range of Ryosuke’s sword, and made the now familiar position of the northern hawk style, with her arms raised high and her belly tucked in.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2IwM2Y4YWZlYjQwZWU4NjVmNDJiMWFkY2YwYjM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stab me,” Katalin said.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGQ3MTY0YTM5ZTRmYzc4YTY1ZjI2MzdjMGZhZDYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryosuke apparently followed his prior advice. When Katalin made the request, Ryosuke immediately leapt forward, thrusting with no reservation about skewering his opponent. It was one of the best </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">tsuki</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> strikes Serena had ever seen, perhaps only eclipsed by what she’d seen the grandmasters achieve. It was a strike she surely would fail to defend against. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWFjY2FhODZlMTQyYTE4NTc5OGNjMjY5MGIyY2Zk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin was not Serena, and she somehow managed to parry Ryosuke's attack with a mixture of swordsmanship and footwork. “The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hawk</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is vulnerable to thrusts,” she explained to the group. “You must use your feet more than in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shimokan,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> yes? Now… form groups of six!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2IxZTg2YzJjOTQ4Mjc4NDUyODFjNGQ0ZGNiZWJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena, Amelia and Ryosuke formed a trio, joined by three other instructors who looked worse for wear. “That was an exceptional strike, Instructor Yamamoto,” Serena said, earnestly complimenting what she saw. Within her, the embers of her competitive spirit flared. This was the level she needed to reach!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjJjYjkwM2RhNzRhYzc4ZDc4NTFiOTBkZjlmNzI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But still not enough,” Ryosuke replied, the corner of his mouth rising.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTNjNDMyMzQ0NDQyZmZiOGNhNjM0ZDhhM2Q3NGVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin explained their next drill. One person would defend using the hawk, while the others would form a queue and attack with thrusts one by one. Once the defender had gone through each opponent, they would switch. Attackers would maintain their aura one level below the defender for their safety.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjBkOWQyMGQxMjQ4YzI4OWE5NzA3ZWUyZjQ4ZGVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena defended first, finding it difficult to maintain her yellow aura in her exhausted state. Aether exhaustion was not a familiar feeling to Serena. Plays, novels and tales told by drunken soldiers exaggerated how long a fight between warriors lasted. Nearly every fight Serena had been in had ended in less than thirty seconds. When it came to survival, it was better to flare your aura as much as possible, attack to the best of your capabilities, and retreat if you can’t break your enemy in seconds. Most warriors can only flare their aura for ten to twelve seconds before risking exhaustion, and an exhausted warrior can only manifest a weak aura.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODc0MGI1ZDNmYzQ5MmE4ODBlZDcyZWFkZjVhZmRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And a weak aura meant death.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDA1ODE3NmEwNTQ3MjRiNTliM2I0YzYyMmZjNzM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In their group, Serena only had difficulty with parrying Ryosuke. Ryosuke was a far more experienced warrior than she was, and she simply couldn’t bring her sword down or step aside in time. Amelia was easy to parry. The woman wasn’t suffering from aether exhaustion, but her body was relatively untrained, and she was getting tired. With her tiredness, her power became sloppy, and an Amelia who was being sloppy was an Amelia who was dangerous. It didn’t help Amelia was still focusing on cycling her aether the way warriors do, all while maintaining her own and Serena’s wards.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjhhNzZjMWI2MTQzY2E4NzVjNWJjYWE3ZWVmNjk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With so much going on, it wasn’t unexpected that Amelia’s sword flew out of her hand from Serena’s parry. It tumbled in the air until stabbing into the floor.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzFmMDE2YWNiZTQxY2M5MjBiM2Q3MmRlY2UzNmU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Death!” Katalin roared from across the room! “Death!” The room went deadly quiet. Katalin snatched Amelia’s sword, jabbing the point in front of Amelia’s neck. “You lost your weapon! That’s death!” she shouted. “You think you’re tired, huh? Well, you’ll be able to sleep if you were on the battlefield because you would be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">dead</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjIyNDVjMTlhYzQyZTBhYmU0YzZhMTY0OThmMDA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…” Amelia audible swallowed, taking a moment to catch her breath. Her face was red, and beads of sweat dotted her forehead. “I have my wards!” she protested.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTVmMjQyYzdhMDQyNWU5ODdlMGY1MDRhZWU4NDc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are not here to learn to be a mage! You are here to learn how to fight like a demon!” Katalin shouted. “Your wards hold you back! They are a crutch! Remove them!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjY1NGY0OTJjMTQxNTBiZWFiNWJkN2U0M2UxMmU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-remove them?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDI2ZWZkNTNkODQ5YzA4M2FiMDc2ZTllZDU0NmEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remove your wards! You’ll never reach red otherwise!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2ZiNGZkYThiNDQyNjhhZGM1MGVkNzhlYmNkNmRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you said-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjg1NTk2ZjFjOTRiNzZhNzBmYjMwNTdmMTBhNmRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your wards are interfering! The warriors' aether cycle cannot flow! You are more than ready to make the step! Remove them!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDA0NDI0YzkxNTQwMDU5MjQ0MzFjYmI4N2ZmNmFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I’ll be unprotected!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWQ4ZDI5NjYwNDQzMmU4MzBmOTM5ZmIwOThkZjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So? Do you not trust me!?” Katalin glared at Amelia and Amelia glared back. Then, as the seconds ticked by, the frustration on Amelia’s face relaxed into something else. A quiet look of determination and… understanding? Serena was puzzled by what she saw and even more confused when Amelia dropped her wards, leaving her vulnerable for perhaps the first time since Serena had known her. It looked like Amelia realised something about Katalin. Did her intuition inform her decision? Regardless, Amelia didn’t stop supplying aether to Serena’s wards.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzdkYzAyZTg0NzQwZWZiZDNmNmMwMjVjYzc2NTA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This shouldn’t take long,” Katalin stated. She flipped Amelia’s weapon, holding the blade and handing it back towards Amelia. “Make some space!” she commanded, and the group obliged, backing away. “We’ll spar until you hit red or until you lose consciousness, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmViNzFlMzQwZTQyMjI5NjY0YzNhZjc0ZjIxNmFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My weapon isn’t warded…” Amelia muttered. Without the external wards on her weapon, it would shatter against Katalin’s aura-enhanced sword.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmE3NjAyYTI1MjQ5ZjRiYjdjNzljZjI2MThjOTQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll do it the old-fashioned way,” Katalin said before dropping her aura. “Metal against metal. Don’t lose your sword. Even if you die, never lose your weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjZiZGJjYTQ3MzQ5ZGU4ZjMwODhkZTUwMjE2NDVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay!” Amelia nodded. Serena saw her tighten her grip.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2U3OGE4Nzk3ZTRmYmU5NjQ4YjEzZmYwNmJmNGFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Without bowing or any other display of etiquette, Katalin closed the distance and began her attack. It seemed ridiculous at first; the expertly delivered strikes appeared slow and unthreatening to the aura-enhanced eyes of Serena. No matter how skilled an opponent was, normal steel wasn’t threatening to a warrior unless it was in the shape of a bullet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzUyNzE0YTExMzRkZDdhZjgzNzk0YzJkMmU5NWVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But Amelia wasn’t a warrior, and without any wards, the steel swinging towards her would cut her. Watching her girlfriend hastily defend against the attacks, her tiredness becoming more evident by the second as she desperately tried to cycle the aether within her made Serena realise how much danger Amelia was actually in. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzcwYWFiNjExYjQ2ODViMmNmMjZlNTlmNDFmYmJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If Katalin wanted, she could cut Amelia’s head off before anyone could react.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTc4OWExMTA5NDQzZGJiNjM1ZTliYmNiMjk3ODJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment this thought passed, Serena took a step forward, only to be stopped by Ryosuke. “Wait,” he hissed quietly. “It’s a gauntlet. The human will be fine. She’s done this to others already.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTQ5MzA5N2MwMDQwNGFhNzFlNjBhNTFjNTM3ZGY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The clanging of steel continued to ring throughout the air. “One mistake, and she could die,” Serena replied, not taking her eyes away. She felt a knot form in her stomach. For the first time, she realised she might lose Amelia. The thought made her sick. At this moment, Serena realised the depth of her love for the human. It transcended all etiquette, all norms, and now she was sure it transcended her loyalty to the Empire.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTM3Y2UzNGYzOTQ1ODliOGEwMDNiNjc5NmRkMzMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia's defence slowed and faltered, but Katalin kept the pressure up. “Don’t stop cycling!” Katalin shouted, assaulting Amelia with strike after strike. Katalin’s sword slipped past Amelia’s guard, slicing her shoulder. Amelia stumbled. Blood poured from the wound, darkening her outfit.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzIxNTc4Y2Q0OTQ3MDE4MDU4NjAzN2EwZjVjYzdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena saw red and prepared </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTU2NDdmNWQ3ZTRkYTg4YmMxZmI2ODY2NDZhNjY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was about to Speak when Amelia suddenly shouted, “Serena, don’t!” The blond human was on one knee, her sword grinding against Katalin’s, who was simply applying physical pressure against Amelia’s weakened form. “It’s okay!” Amelia called between gasps of breath. “I want this!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODJmYmEzMGFkMzQ2ZmM4NjEyMzkwODhiNzgwM2Mx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin didn’t even look Serena’s way.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2NlNjZhMjU0YTRjODI5MGU0ZjVjNGY0NjBmYjI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The other instructors looked at Serena in shock and, in some cases, fear. They would have picked up on Serena’s readied Word. Ryosuke said something, but Serena was too tunnel-visioned on Amelia to register what he said. She simmered her Word, ready to Speak at any moment. Amelia’s words had prompted Serena to hold back. Just.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGM1YTdhZjljODQ0YjA5MDBkZmYzZGUzOGQ2MDQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia grunted, standing with great effort. Katalin continued to attack, shouting, “Don’t just defend! Attack!” Amelia obeyed and, with dripping sweat and blood leaking from her wound, began desperately swinging back against Katalin. The northern demon blocked, parried and simply dodged. “Is that it!? To become a warrior, you need more than that! What are you swinging a sword for!?” Katalin taunted Amelia. “How will you protect those that you love!? Will you let them die because you’re tired!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzY5ZTdmZDUyYTQ2NGY5Yjc4ZGMxNTU5MmU2NjY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… can… protect…” Amelia muttered between gasps of breath. Her aether flared, more and more cycled throughout her body with every passing second. It was not a mage's aether flow but almost the flow of a warrior’s aura. As much as she hated what Katalin was doing, Serena had to admit it was working.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjAyMTcwYzk5NDQ5ODY5MWU4M2E2ZDU0MjU0YzNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia was close.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjJlZTE0YWExNjQxM2I4NjdlOWM1YjIxODg4ZmE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aura is more than a spell! It is a divine charge! A blessing to defend the weak! To defend the Empire!” Katalin called out as Amelia’s strikes began taking on an element of fluidity. “To defend your family! Your friends! Can you do it, Amelia!? Imagine if I attacked Instructor Halen, yes!? Imagine if I cut her down! What would-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWU5MDBiMWNlNDQzMzZhNjlkZjc2MTUyOWFiMTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Argh!” Amelia screamed, swinging her sword as a red aura </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">exploded</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> from her body. Serena’s vision was blanketed in a blinding red light, and for a moment, she thought Amelia had Spoken a Word. No, it wasn’t that; it was still only red aura, merely amplified by Amelia’s titanic amount of aether. It spewed from her, and from where she stood, Amelia glowed like the red moon itself. There was no subtlety about this, no gentle hue of red from a student manifesting aura for the first time. This was Amelia Thornheart, Serena’s girlfriend, powering a red aura at a level equivalent to a First Word.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzFjMWY3MjU5OTQ4NzRhYzkyNWEwYWNkMGVkNWRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, slowly, the red light dimmed, and everyone’s vision readjusted to the scene before them. Amelia was in her stance, her hands gripping her sword where she’d just finished her strike. She was gasping; her eyes glowed with power while her breath fogged with both heat and aether. In front of her stood Katalin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTdmMTEyZmQ1ODRiNjA5Nzg4MzM0NTExYmU3ZmNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And on the floor lay Katalin of Driss’s severed arm, still gripping her weapon tightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTQyOTM4Mjk1MzRmZjViYjZkNzQyYWE2YTRmZjY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt her blood run cold as she, along with everyone else in the room, stared in shock at the dismembered limb. She looked at Katalin, expecting </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">something</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, but the northern demon had a calm expression. Amelia stood up slowly, her breath and aura stabilising. Only then did her face turn ashen, her eyes widening as she realised what she’d just done.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjBjODZmODA2NzRlYTdiNjQ5YjRlNTUxMThiNTVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fucking hell…” Ryosuke muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTY0ZGZkODcwODQ2ZDNiNWYwNmE2MTQwNWY1M2E5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I-I’m…” Amelia began blubbering, tears running down her cheeks. “I’m sorry! I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean it! I didn’t-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmEyNDI4YjFiYjRmMTE4ZWEzNTdlNDk0ZTEzMmY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enough,” Katalin intoned, raising her remaining hand, cutting Amelia off. “How do you feel?” The demon sniffed, examining Amelia’s aura. “Good stability. Good start. Are you going to throw up? That’s common the first time.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDhkMWRmM2ZkNjRkOGRiNDA1MmQzYTViNzc2NWMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-enough about me!” Amelia stuttered, pointing a shaky finger at the severed limb. “Your arm! I’m sorry! I’m so sorry!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzFkOGYxMzA0NjQ5MWE4NjM1NzhjNjQyZWY3MWMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes,” Katalin looked down at her solitary limb like it was a passing curiosity. “Let’s see here…” the demon said idly. “Been a while since this has happened.” Katalin bent down, picking up her arm with her remaining functioning hand. “This is a good lesson!” Katalin announced, raising the limb that was still gripping the sword. “Never forget how dangerous aura can be against an unprotected limb, yes? Or even a higher-tier aura against a lesser colour, understand? Now…” She held the detached limb against her bloody stump.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmU3YTk2OTc2MTQyMzU5ODM1OTVkMmUzNGVhZDU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assistant Instructor Thornheart, now we have a decent foundation to build from. We’ll take a break before the second half of the session. Would you mind invoking some of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> grace and reattaching my arm?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzU5ZTU0NmM3MTQ1NmVhZjU5NjE5N2UxMjZjZDM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin looked around, clicking her tongue.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWZhNmE3YTQ5YjQ5Y2Y4NjZlOGNkNmY2NDQzOTkw" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And can someone fetch me some damn mint tea!?”</span></p>

<p class="cnMxY2Y2MmY0MWVhZDRlMjY4YzI1NzdhMDdmNTkwMGVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjMxNmFjZTI5MzRlMDY5NzUwZmIwYmM2MmM0MDlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This must never get out,” Grandmaster Shun said, glaring at the three of them. The grandmaster sat at his desk, hands clenched with white knuckles hinting at his controlled anger. Serena, Amelia, and Katalin stood to attention. The demon's presence wasn’t quite as intimidating as the Dragon’s, but it was enough that Serena felt a tinge of nervousness; a part of her instincts raised alarm bells at the sheer violence he was capable of.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmEyMjlhMTg0ZDQzYWI5NGQ5ZjQ0YTViODg4MjEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After Amelia had quite literally </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">disarmed </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and then </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">rearmed </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin, they soon moved into the second half of the session. Only Serena, Amelia and the three Head Instructors, Ryosuke, Nathaniel, and Joey, remained while everyone else, exhausted and gossiping over the events that had just transpired, left the room. Katalin seemed especially eager to have Amelia begin sparring with her newly formed red aura.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2NhZmVmNGUzODQ3MWRiN2UwYmRlZmE4YjA1N2Qz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And what an aura it was!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmYwNmE1NTVjNzRkMDZiM2NmYTk1MWJhNWJhNWQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena didn’t think she’d ever seen a red aura with such vibrant hues. Looking at Amelia’s aura was fascinating; it somehow seemed to give off more colour than it should have. It was so <em>rich </em>that it imparted a sense of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">density</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, which wasn’t a word typically used to describe a warrior's aura. An aura, for most warriors, is a subtle sheen across the skin, with short-lived rays of coloured light dancing along the body.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjE0OTM2MjJjODRhMjg5Yzc0MTM3NTVjYmE0MWUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But Amelia was not a normal warrior.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjUyMTcwNzlhNTQ3M2ZiMjI1ODJkMGYzOWFjNjVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin had expressed no real surprise at the magnitude of Amelia’s aura, nor did she seem bothered at losing a limb. It was as if she’d expected both. Was that possible? Was the Highlord skilled enough to see the true depths of Amelia’s talents? And, Empress forbid, did the sword maniac intentionally let her arm be sliced off to make a point to Amelia and the rest of the class?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDNhZmQ0MjY2NzRkMDFiZjUxMjAyZTZiN2E4YTM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The latter was a question Serena kept to herself. It would be wildly inappropriate to raise the matter. The question itself implied something negative regarding the sanity of a Highlord. With the waves Serena had already been making for herself and House Halen, she didn’t need to cause any more trouble.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGJkOWQ1ZWNjNzQ3OWFhYWI4N2ZkOWIwZTM4NmMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, she found herself, along with Amelia and Katalin, in the grandmaster's office, being thoroughly dressed down. The man had stormed into the training room and demanded they follow him. It seemed some instructors had immediately run to the grandmaster to inform him of what had happened.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzA4ODBmMzM5OTQ1Y2ZiMjRkZmJmMmIzYzA4MmUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This academy has trained warriors for almost a thousand years,” the grandmaster continued. “I follow in the footsteps of Grandmaster Kobayashi, who followed in the footsteps of Grandmaster Kimura and the chain continues right back to the founding of Cascadia. More than eight hundred years of history. A history of blood, dirt, sand and metal. We are not the only academy in Asamaywa, but we’re the only one that can trace their lineage back so far! The only academy that our divine empress visited four centuries ago!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTM1NzA0NzcwYjQ2ZTg5MTJkMzlhZmI3NDgzZDRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For all that time, we were a small dojo. It is only recently, with new expectations and funding from Greatlord Oshiro and our Overlord that we’ve expanded to what we are today. Now, we no longer train only the talented children of the Eastern Nobility but entertain students from the far reaches of the Empire. The sword, spear and bow are no longer all we teach!” The grandmaster began counting with his fingers. ”Magic. Crystalcraft. Cryptography. Battlefield medicine. We teach it all!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGZhMWIwODA3NDQ2ZjI4M2FlNTQyNmY5ZDQ5YTcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cascadian Lords send their children here to be moulded into warriors, mages, and most importantly, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">officers</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. They expect us to imprint the proper traits into their children: obedience, loyalty, discipline, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">skill</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. They especially expect us to do it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">safely</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!” The demon's eyes narrowed as he emphasised the last word. “What message do you think it sends to Greatlord Oshiro and the rest of Cascadia if our instructors are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">running around cutting off each other's damn arms!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” His voice rose to a shout, slamming his hand onto his desk.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmEyOGE2MmFhYzQ0YWNhN2RkODVmY2NhODJlNzhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What were you thinking!?” he jabbed a finger at Amelia. “I would expect someone of your talents to be able to maintain </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">control</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! You cut off a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> arm! Why do you think people are given the title of Lord-Prospect before they become a full Cascadian Lord? Well!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGZkZWIyY2I1ZDRjNjhhNzUxMTc2ZmZlODg1MDI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-” Amelia began.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTI0MmZkZDRiMTRlNzU4MzUzZjA4YjRjNjA4MTBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly! To </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">prospect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the individual to determine whether they are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">worthy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the title! Do you think cutting off Highlord Driss’s arm, the daughter of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Driss, is an appropriate action for one of your station? Do you know what punishment could await you should the Greatlord petition our Overlord for satisfaction? Do you!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDExNWYyNWM5NTRiMWNiYWM1YzJjYjQ1ZWUyZmIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Capital punishment, right?” Amelia questioned, slightly tilting her head. Surprisingly, Amelia didn’t sound all that concerned. To be fair, neither was Serena. The last time a Lord-Prospect had been put to death for harming a Lord was more than a century ago. If the knowledge of the event got out, and Katalin </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her father sought remuneration, then a fine would likely be all Amelia would get. Given what Serena understood of Katalin so far, she suspected the Highlord didn’t even care about losing an arm.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTg4OTdlMzQ0MjQwZmQ5MDdmMjBkYjhmMjIxMmIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, it was reattached.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWNmNTFhZWFmYTQ2ZTJiZmYxNTMzNzc0NDczMzEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And, Empress forbid, even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">if</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia was somehow sentenced to something more...</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2RkYmU0ZGU4YjQ0ZmM5N2QyNmViOTM2YmIwOWZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">How would they enforce it?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmM1MjI1MjMwZjQyZGZhM2VmYmY0ZWM2YTcxMGY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” the grandmaster growled, glaring at Amelia for a few seconds before turning his anger towards Serena. Despite her battlefield experience, she still felt herself bristle under his glare.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjlhYzllZTExODQyYjViODJmN2Y3YTc5NDVjODBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” he said, jabbing a finger in her direction. “What in the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">seven hells</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> were you thinking to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">prepare a Word</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? Against a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">What were you going to do? Strike Highlord Driss down?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjljMjhhY2VlYjQxZDA5YzAxYWMwZjY1ZTRmOTJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought. She had been about to do exactly that. Seeing Amelia bleed had switched something on in her head. Something primal. An instinctive need to protect those she loved. Of course, Serena knew she couldn’t explain it that way, so she chose an explanation that ever so slightly bent the truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmE4NTFlZmJmZDQ3NjdiZjMxNmNlNzg4Mzg1NzRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was concerned the duel was developing out of control,” Serena explained. “I was concerned Amelia’s life was in danger, and I knew without a Word I would have no hope in intervening against someone of Highlord Driss’s strength.” Serena turned slightly, bowing to the northern demon. “My sincerest apologies, Highlord Driss. I should have trusted your judgment. If I were a man, I would shave my head in shame.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWVkOGRjZGQ3ZjQyNmM5ZGVmMzUxNjc0ZDljZTc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do not worry yourself, Instructor Halen,” Katalin replied smoothly. “Trust needs to be earned and we are still so unfamiliar with each other, yes? I take no offence. I am more than happy to take responsibility.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjMyMDZiNGQxMzQyZjhiNjMzMzFiY2UwYThiMDU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mentally, Serena breathed a sigh of relief. She’d suspected Katalin would take this approach and was glad to be proven right. At no point had the northern demon indicated she cared about her injury. Given Serena’s position as Lord of House Halen, many demons would have taken advantage of this opportunity. Luckily, Katalin seemed more than willing to let it go.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODlkNThmZGI4ODRlYzk4NWQyZWJmOGM5ZGZkYmFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The grandmaster, on the other hand, wasn’t.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2VlMjA0OTA2ZDQxZmViOTdkOTA2ODFjYWQ3ZDE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">someone’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> taking responsibility,” he said, turning his ire to Katalin. “Highlord Driss, it was out of respect for your father and the belief that having someone of your talents train my Instructors would be beneficial to the academy that I permitted your request. I never would have thought someone with your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">reputation</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> would be so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">reckless</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! This must never happen again, understand?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTA5MzJjZTZkZTRjZjJhOGI5ZjA4OTIxYzU3N2Y2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin turned sharply to the grandmaster. Placing her right fist against her chest, she bowed deeply. “You have my apologies and guarantee that this will not repeat itself, Grandmaster. Seeing a powerful mage form an aura is so rare that I could not help myself. I should have prepared properly for this scenario. Rest assured, I will not mention these events to my father.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODY2ZjY4NWFjNjQ0ZWE4NGQwNTA5ODJjZGZjYTZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If the grandmaster was surprised at having a Highlord apologise so earnestly to him, it didn’t show. He grunted his acceptance before turning back to Amelia. “Assistant Instructor Thornheart,” he intoned with a voice slightly more devoid of anger. “You haven’t been here three days and you’ve already damaged one of our Speaker Rooms and cut off a Highlord's arm. Do you think you could continue your tenure here as an Assistant Instructor with a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">little </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">more control?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzEzNjRjYWRlZTRjYTBhZjI5MmFkZjk0Yjg4OWE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded enthusiastically. “Sure thing!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDEwNmNiMjAyZTQ2Yjc4NGNhNmViODc4N2E0MmNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Get out then, all of you.” He waved his hand dismissively. The three of them quickly began exiting the office. As Amelia was leaving, the grandmaster called out to her once more.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjFjMzkwNjIzYjQ1YjBiZWEyMTc5NGJiYzY3ODgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assistant Instructor Thornheart?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjNkZGQ3MmQyMzRkNTliMGNmMzczN2YzNmI2MzMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?” Amelia answered, turning in the doorway.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTFkNjg3MGI2OTQ0NGI5ZTQyYWMyNDYxM2NiYzll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Congratulations on reaching red. You’ll make a fearsome warrior.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzJkYzViZjBmNTQyMzA5Y2IxMzc4MTkwNjdjNmRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-oh! Thank you, Grandmaster!” Amelia bowed again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDEzMWJmNmIyYzRkYjE5NTFlNWUzZjdlNDQ4MTU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The door closed, and the trio began walking back through the corridors. Once they’d travelled some distance, Katalin stopped suddenly. Turning her purple eyes towards Serena, she said, “Instructor Halen, although I hold no grudge, I am surprised you are prepared to Speak against me in protection of a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Is your connection to her so strong?”</span></p><span class="cmZmOTJjODMxMDYzZjQwNWNiNGIyNWM2MGM5OGJkNWIw"><br/>Love this story?

<p class="cnNiM2FhY2FmMGMzMzQ1NDdhYWRjMmQzYzkzZGI2ZDU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena couldn’t help but swallow nervously. She quickly covered it up with a light cough. Of course, she expected she would be fielding questions like this in the future. Serena didn’t want to hide her relationship with Amelia. In many ways, she was proud of it, despite it being against her faith and her family's ideals. However, now wasn’t the time to be completely honest about it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDgwZmZkZDhiODQxZjlhMTM4NDUyMjNmMzkxMTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia has saved my life and the lives of my crew. I feel a great debt to her, regardless of her race. She is also an advisor to House Halen, and we’d much rather she remain alive and well for that purpose.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGU5MDk0Zjk5NDRkMjFiMjJmYzg0N2MxODUwYTkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin's eyes sparkled and for a moment Serena thought her mouth curved slightly. “And if you had Spoken against me? Do you think you would have been able to defeat me?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGY4OGQ3NTE2MDRhNDc5YzQ1MGU1MmQyMjhiMDgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...No,” Serena said after some hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjQzMGI0NDk1MDRhYWY5MWY4NzkwZDIzNDQ3ODIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yet, you still would have, yes? Even now, you would, knowing I cannot be defeated?” Katalin’s words were empty of any pride or arrogance. They were stated plainly as if they were an evident truth of the world.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjVhNzE3ODQzNTQyNTM5YmI1NjYyOTM2YTkzOTVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Correct, Highlord.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDNlMjRiOTBmNzRiZGQ4Nzk0NDJiNGNiZDY2ZGFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instructor, please.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTk0MGMyOTg3ZTRlZWVhN2I2OTg5NDY5NDdjMjgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instructor.” Serena bent her head slightly as an apology.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzVkNWQ1Y2Y5MzQ5M2NhNjliMGIyZGI2Mzk3MThm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you?” Katalin turned her attention to Amelia. “Do you think you would be able to contend with me?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjI3MDY5NGI1ZDQxOWY4OTYzMTcxYzQwMTlhMmFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… maybe?” Amelia answered, shrugging her shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmM1ZTBhZWRhMDQzZGRiODJhNDI0MzJkZWYwZmE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin laughed softly. It was a sweet laugh, gentle yet polite. It was the kind of laugh you wouldn’t expect to come from a rigorous warrior like she was. “After everything you’ve seen, that is your answer? How amusing.” Katalin walked past them before turning and saying, “I look forward to continuing the training. Now that you’ve reached red, you will not have to take such risks to reach orange. Saturday morning. First light, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmIyMGFjOTUzYTRjZTA5M2Y1MWEwNDM4ODJkN2Ni" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm! We’ll be there!” Amelia chirped, flashing her characteristic thumbs up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTUwNjg0ZmJkNzRiYWFhMzc0YmUyZThiN2VhM2Iz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Goodbye, Instructor Halen, Assistant Instructor Thornheart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTQ5ZDJiOWQyYTRmYmI5MTQ4MzM1NjRmYTYxODc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The pair watched the auburn-haired demon stroll away without a care in the world. Serena faced Amelia and said, “I was surprised you trusted her enough to bring down your wards.” Amelia blinked her crimson eyes. “Your intuition? Instincts?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTU5MTc3ZmJmOTQ5NTY5N2M0ZTFkMjEwZWIwNWM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm,” Amelia hummed, nodding slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzlhNjdmZjM1MDQ3ZjBiMTg4MTE4ZWY2NGE1YWY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so,” Serena continued, letting her voice quieten. “I would prefer it if…” She took a breath. “...If you never allow yourself to be in such a situation again. Regarding your wards, I mean.” Just the thought of an unprotected Amelia made Serena uncomfortable. She wasn’t sure what kind of reaction her request would get her, but she didn’t expect Amelia to burst into a wild grin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDg0NzYwNzE3YTQ3ZmFhYTY3NjQzMmQ4NjQ1YWE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTViZmJiMzllMzQxZWJiOGYzMzFlN2Y2YWUwOTY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were really going to Speak </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to protect me, weren’t you? Against </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Amelia giggled, her cheeks reddening ever so slightly. “That means a lot to me! Thank you!” She leaned in and whispered, “If we were elsewhere, I would show you exactly how much it means to me…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTJjMjhmYWZiMTRjNTM5NzljOGIzNmUyM2U4ZDk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This incorrigible human!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzFkYmM0ZjM4OTQ5M2Q4MDNkMjJmZTZhMjBiODA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just…” Serena crossed her arms and looked away, forcing her heartbeat to calm down. She’d become somewhat used to Amelia’s crass form of flirting. It was so unusual compared to what she had been brought up to expect. A part of Serena appreciated the direct nature of it, although she wished Amelia would hold back sometimes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWY3ZDQ1ZTczOTQ3OGJiZWQ3NDIyYWZlZGJkYjAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzViNWFiN2E1MzRhMzA5YWE4OGEyOGIwY2UwZTY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just shut up, idiot.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzEwZDI3MmU3NTQ0NzA4OGFhZWYwNjM1MDc2ZDkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmODhhZTE4YTM4MjRjMDM5ZDgxZTRlNzkwNDUzODc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTAxNTQ0NmFiYjRhM2RhODhiZmZmZDI1OGYzYzY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena and Amelia sat down amongst the other instructors for lunch. Even if you didn’t have a list of attendees of Katalin’s session, you could deduce them by looking at who piled their plates high with meat. Serena was no different; her craving for something greasy caused her to pile fried fish and mutton on her plate. The protein-heavy meal had prompted Amelia to raise an amused eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWZjODI0ZDMwODRkYmE4OWJjZWMyMzVlNjk5ZTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once they began eating, it didn’t take long for Amelia to become the topic of discussion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDRhY2I0OTRmMDQ2NWFiNGYwZmMxOTYxOTZkYjE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While the instructors couldn’t talk publicly about exactly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">how</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia achieved her first aura, they could talk about the achievement itself. The tone of the instructors towards Amelia had generally been polite, but now it was tinged with genuine respect. Amelia, in their eyes, was no longer just an abnormally powerful mage playing about with swords. She was now a warrior like them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YThkMGQ1NTY5MTRlODNiYTQwMGNjMTFmODQxYTYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How does aura feel compared to wards?” asked Nathaniel.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGZlMTM3N2FmNDQ3ZjY5ZDNjZjQyYjY2Njk4Yzk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It feels completely different!” Amelia answered cheerfully. “Much more… I’m not sure what the right word is. Much more personal? More intimate? Wards feel more detached, whereas my aura felt like an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">extension</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of myself. The way the aether moves… well, I understand now why mages rarely become warriors.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTE3MmJkMWQ5YTRhNDdiMjI3YTRmMzdhMmYxYWVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Especially a Speaker,” Nathaniel added while everyone else nodded along. “It’s not that uncommon to have student warriors capable of casting first-circle magic, or a first-circle mage to reach red, but for someone as entrenched along one of the paths as far as you are… very rare, Assistant Instructor Thornheart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjEzMGEyOTRlNTQ1YzFhN2Q1YWY3MmFlZGFiNGIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next step will be to practice extending that aura over your weapon,” Ryosuke said, looking up from over the broadsheet he was reading. “Although I don’t think it’ll take you long, given the amount of aether you seem to have under control.” He resumed reading, his brow furrowing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODg4OTY0MjVkZTQzNmI4MWQwYjEyMWFlZTlmNDc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anything interesting?” Serena asked, gesturing towards the paper. She hoped it wasn’t another Amelia-centric headline. If the hacks got wind of what happened that morning, they would become rabid. They’d be at the academy’s gates regardless of any warnings from above.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjQ5ZTlkZWVmODRhNWE4OTczYzZiYmI4YmY2NTcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raiders getting bolder,” Ryosuke said. He passed the paper to Serena before continuing to eat his lunch.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDY0ZTg5Y2FjZTQwYWFiZTM4ZDU2YzRhNDZjMWU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena examined the headlines, raising an eyebrow. “What’s this nonsense? A ‘Pirate Republic’? I thought they were put down years ago?” When demonkind created the first lift engine, air-piracy was born shortly after. Mercenaries, deserters and the dregs of society would turn to the criminal occupation to line their pockets. Major trade routes were protected, but the Empire was large and not everywhere could be covered by the Imperial Navy, especially the routes that skirted the Empire’s boundaries.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTg4YzljMTkxMjRlYmY4MTlhZmRlYTRmOGYxNWIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">One of these trade routes was the Southern Passage, a stretch of sky that reached from the Salaban Range at the southern tip of the Southern Terra Firma to the east, skirting the south edge of the Shattered Isles before opening up to the island chain of Kraken Kur and then the far eastern cities of Fengra and Hokanai. It was a profitable trade route; the favourable winds cut weeks off the alternative journey of heading north towards Centralis before turning southeast. However, it was a route in uncharted skies and the perfect location for pirates and other unsavoury individuals to hide.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjAwMTBhOGQ3YzQ2YWM5Y2M4NzM2YTY5OTFmMTZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When Serena was younger, the southern pirates dominated the headlines. The pirates became bolder, eventually striking inland as far as the Shimashina-Nai route. At this point, the insult had gone on too long, and the Overlord could no longer ignore the complaints of the Aindo Greatlords and mustered a suppression fleet to deal with the problem once and for all. It had been expensive; the ensuing battles stretched the eastern fleet, and the debts incurred took a decade to repay.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTIyNTFkMTVmYjQwOTg4NWI0NzZkN2U4NDhjNTQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it had done its job, and the Southern Passage was determined to be safe. Well, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">relatively</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> safe. The sky was unchartable. Its proximity to the Shattered Isles and the massive storm systems in the far south meant islands were constantly appearing and disappearing from the maps.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODNjY2E4Y2RkYzQ5YTA5YWI4Y2VhZjdjYzE3MmM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rumour is some Arakian warrior has brought the rats to heel,” Ryosuke said. “He and his men started harassing the desert skies five years ago. Now they’re reaching east.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmNjZWE3MGViMTQ5YTM5MzI2YTdjMDljZTM4MDVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do we have a name?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTMwMGFkYjIxMTRhNmFiMTgyOGIwOGNhYTY3YTBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hacks like to call him the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Blackhorn</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. From Hakim, apparently.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDE4MTViMDE2ZjQxOTZhZmIwNzQzMzBiYzA0OTk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve heard he was a tribal soldier from Dectus,” Joey suggested.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmIwYjkzNmFlMzRiZDViODMxNDFjYTljZTliOWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Broadsheet the other week said he was a deserter from the Tevari guard,” Nathaniel added.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjgxM2VjMGM2ZTQwMDdiODBhNGE3MjgyNWRhZTUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The instructors shared their theories on the origins of the upstart pirate lord. Other than the man’s nickname, little was known about the demon. It was likely that the focus on the Cascadia-Republic war had reduced resources allocated to pirate suppression, allowing the resurgence of organised piracy under this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Blackhorn</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGMyYjY1ZjI3YzRhODU4MzQxNjcwZDJmOWFjNDdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wouldn’t the Southern Overlord handle it?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjhjMjdiN2YwNzQ0ODA5YzBhNjg1MmRmNDg3NDE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!” Ryosuke scoffed. “He’ll see it as the responsibility of the desert Greatlords. The reasoning would be that if they can’t handle it, then perhaps they shouldn’t be Greatlords. It’s how things work in the desert. Might makes right, and if you don’t have the strength to protect what is yours, then you don’t really own it.” He shook his head. “Every few centuries they get full of themselves and the Empress has to remind them who’s on top.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2MyYzMwODMyMTQzNmVhOWZmMjc0NDgwZGU4Mjkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When was the last time?” Amelia asked, her eyes widening.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzAwYzRlZmMwYTQwYTNiODMyM2Q2MGRiMDJiZWVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Ryosuke rubbed his chin before turning to one of the few southern instructors in the academy. “Abbas! Do you know?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjlkYjQ4Y2NkYzQ0NGZhMWM1MTFmMGQzN2JjNmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Six-fifty-five. So, almost two centuries now,” Instructor Abbas responded. “They say she took the form of the Great Spider and Spoke the Third Word to put down the previous Overlord. I doubt it’ll happen again any time soon. The current conflict is cooling the desert blood.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGFlODYxMjAwMjRiYmE5MzVjZWFjY2E1MTI1OGY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena found herself nodding along. Despite the conflict straining the North the most, about thirty percent of the army battling Republican forces were Southern soldiers. Say what you will about how they conduct themselves; the South did not back down from a fight.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDk0ZDA3MDYxYTQxY2JhZjA0OTI0YjE5NTAzYmQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And the attitudes you speak of don’t reflect the entire desert, Ryosuke,” Instructor Abbas intoned, pointing a piece of cutlery at the Department Head. “The Wami and Yemenian people are quite adjusted to more </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">modern</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> sensibilities. Even many of the Arakian are leaving behind the old ways. It only remains strong within the Dakian communities, around Qasim, Dectus and Tevari.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGRjYmE2OTk5NjQ3ZmE5ZDJjMmMwYzI5ZjQxZjlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean no offence, Abbas,” Ryosuke said, tilting his head in apology. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzVkYzJkNDYzNzQxYzhhODU5NzJkZTUzMDNhZDRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The southern demon merely shook his head and continued eating. </span></p>

<p class="cnMwNTEwZmM1NWU0ODQxZTQ5MjM2NDgyOTkzZDkxNzFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia finished her meal and followed Serena outside. She had to do her best not to skip or jump with joy. Red aura! She’d reached it! Finally! Sure, the length of time she had taken was outrageously fast compared to a normal person, but she had become impatient! The sense of achievement warmed her heart. It may have only been red aura, but to Amelia, it was more satisfying than any of the magical abilities she had demonstrated thus far!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTM1YjQ0N2EwZTQzNzg4ZmJlODJmNDU5YzExODU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She couldn’t wait to be free that afternoon to train more. Now that she’d formed an aura once, she felt the second time would come quickly. The feeling of it was still fresh in her mind. She planned to play around with her cloaking magic to see what worked best in covering up her new abilities. After that, she would-</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGQ5MGVkZDRlNjQ3Zjc4OTJiMzlmNzEzZTZmZmQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm? Sorry?” Amelia asked. Serena had said something.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjcwOGRmZWJhMzRhMDZiMWUxMGY2YWMyMWYwY2E2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was saying, come find me when you’re free. We’ll go over your red aura together.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2U2NDcwM2VkMjRjMjg4YmU4OGUwNjY2OGM0OWU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure!” Amelia chirped, feeling her face beam. “I have to monitor a first-year class now. Then I was hoping to catch Lunaria, I mean, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Inoue, for some advice.” She looked around quickly, thankful no students were nearby. It was easy to forget to use the proper titles in public. “I’ll find you after, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2I2MmEyMTZkMTRmYTA5MzAwZjc4MmE3MTVmMjVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.” Serena nodded. “See you later.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmI5YzcxZDhkZDRlODg4YWE0NGVmODllNTVmOGNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia hummed happily as she left Serena and headed to the magic tower. After the upcoming lesson, she had some topics she wanted to cover with Lunaria. Now that they had a good working relationship, Amelia reckoned the Head Instructor would be the ideal person to ask about the other reality she detected while transformed by the Second Word.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDhmYWM1MmUyMjQ0ZTNiYjAxM2U0ZjMyZDViMjVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">And whether the instructor knew anything about Anathor and his kind, the mysterious </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Formless</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNlNTU3NWU5ZjE2NzQzODNiMmUyZDczOTg2YjFmMzI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzc2MDgwMjQ3YjQyMGNiOWNmMGM0ZjMwZmI1M2Qw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia quietly observed the first-year class. It was led by Instructor Kawas, who, aided by a handful of assistant instructors, inscribed first-circle formations in chalk on the room's enormous blackboard. The twenty-five students of Junior Class C did their best to copy the geometry into their notes, scratching away while Amelia listened in on Kawas’s instruction.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjNhYWI5NTM5MjQyMGJiNzU5Y2MyZmZiNGYxMTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Note the double-helix shouldn’t pass the heartline here,” Kawas intoned to the class, snapping a long cane against the blackboard. “The aetherflow must separate before; otherwise, you won’t have room to construct the dextral and sinistral triquetra here and here.” The instructor prodded at another area of the board, saying, “Those of you who struggle to form first-circle triquetras can use the simpler lemniscate as a replacement, although you’ll struggle to match the former’s efficiency. For the select few in the class who are already experienced with these sub-formations, consider replacing this area with a reuleaux triquetra; you’ll find the practice useful if and when you attempt second-circle wards.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2I5OTYzM2Q1MjQ2ZDhiODA0NzdiMWRlZDc4MDc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia desperately wanted to grab a pen and paper and start copying earnestly. She couldn’t, of course. If she did, everyone would know she was a fraud! A charming and powerful fraud! Everyone naturally assumed that Amelia knew all the underlying theories and terminology that formed the building blocks of spellcraft, but she didn’t!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWRiZjhlMTgxNDQyMzViNmM4ZGZmOTkyODZmMDNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s magical talents were entirely intuitive and instinctive. She didn’t think about this stuff at all! Her aether naturally moved according to her intentions; a determined push of her willpower would manifest her desired spell. Amelia wasn’t thinking about her aether flowing from double-helix spin formations into rouleaux triquetra amplification nodes; it just happened!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjY0OGJiZmY1ZTQ1ZmVhZjUxNDQ5ZmQyNGM3MDU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She had to admit she was impressed by the rigour of the academic study of magic. Instructors and students didn’t see aether as some mystical substance beyond human or demon understanding. It was a phenomenon that followed strict natural laws. When formed into specific three-dimensional shapes, the aether's behaviour was well understood and modelled with equations similar to the fluid-dynamics equations Amelia was familiar with from her old world. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjNkNmIxNWRjYjRmOGVhOGM0ZTUzYzMyNmMxMDgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although using different symbols, the mathematical equations Kawas had written on the blackboard were almost identical to the partial differential equations that formed the Navier-Stokes equations Amelia had long since memorised. There were slight differences; where her version of the equation used a Cauchy stress tensor, the version on the blackboard used something called an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">aetheric flow tensor</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. These equations were called the Barfield-Sina Equations, named after the demons that discovered them seventy years ago.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODkwOWExMGJjNzQ0ODM4NWU0YjdiOGY3MDA2M2Ey" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia made as many mental notes as she could. Thankfully, she hadn’t been approached by any students or instructors who wished to discuss magical theory with her. She wasn’t sure if it was considered impolite or if they were wary of working with a human, but Amelia was glad to have some breathing room. By taking advantage of her right as an instructor to sit in on any lecture she wanted, coupled with the mathematical books she’d checked out from the library, Amelia planned to quickly learn the nomenclature of the academic field so she could at least pretend she knew what she was on about.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzM3NjFkYTc4MjRlZTk5NjYxZDFlNzY2OTA5MjJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">These discovered mathematical structures that modelled aether highlighted how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">different</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia’s reality was from the game she played in the hospital. The full-immersion game she put thousands of hours into didn’t have anywhere close to the detail she was now becoming aware of. Amelia previously thought perhaps the game represented a time in Cascadia’s past, but nothing she’d seen on any maps, names of people, kingdoms, or cities matched anything she’d discussed with Serena. The anti-climactic conclusion Amelia had come to was that the developers behind the game somehow possessed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">some</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> knowledge of the real magic system and that they reproduced it virtually for entertainment.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDRiODc1MTAzYjQxMGY4MDY0MDFiMWMyODY4YTk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, that didn’t explain why Amelia was in the situation that she was.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjQxYjBlODQ2MjRjMTFiMWYyNWE0ZDg0NmI5NDVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">You couldn’t really gain real-world magical abilities by just playing a game, could you?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDZkYjQ3MjM1YzQwOTNiMTlhMjk1NjkyNjJlMGI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A clap from Kawas snapped Amelia out of her thoughts. The class moved into the practical part. Twenty-five students began trying to construct the formations on the blackboard. The more inexperienced of them began with simpler shapes and sub-formations, while the more capable students experimented with complete formations, creating first-circle wards while adjusting their aether flows to better their understanding of the process.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDdiZGZmMDcxODRhMDM5ZjIwYTcxNmQwNDdjNGQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of the twenty-five students, only a couple seemed to stand above the rest, either at or close to second-circle magic. Serena had told her that graduating from an academy as a second-circle mage or an orange-aura warrior was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">good</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Being capable of third-circle or yellow aura was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">excellent</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It would guarantee a prosperous career in civilian life or, if they were on the officer course, a double promotion upon graduation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTJjZTY2ZjAwZTRjMzI4NTMwZWY3NzkxMTU0NTlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When it came to a student communing a First Word, that event was exceptionally rare. Amelia had seen the hall of fame in the entrance hall listing the students who had achieved such a momentous achievement; it was a short list with often more than a decade in between names. Not even her fantastic girlfriend, the talented and ferocious </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena Halen,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> had managed to do it. She did see the names </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Takahiro Oshiro</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuu Shun</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, which Amelia made the educated guess were the first names of Asamaywa’s greatlord and the academy's grumpy grandmaster.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzI3MDQ4ZWQ4OTRkZGVhY2U2YzMwYjc5NmM2NGM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia hummed to herself while she watched the class. Instructor Kawas and her assistants offered help and advice to the struggling students. Some common issues the students faced were maintaining an aetherflow with sufficient velocity within their bodies, failing to construct the formation large enough, and difficulty controlling their aether to form the required shape. The assistants would demonstrate by sitting close to the students, constructing the formations themselves in an exaggerated size, and then flaring their aether so the student's perception of the aetherfield would give them a better understanding of how they should be doing it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzI0OWIxY2FhODQ5N2VhMzhjMTc5ZTEyNWI4MTNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia made a mental note to start practising exaggerated versions of the sub-formations. In the next class, she should be capable of helping out as long as she learned the terminology to go with it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTI2MjU4MTcxYzRmMGFiNDc0NmIwMDZlZDA1YjBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The class ended, and the students filtered out, some looking tired and frustrated. Amelia thanked Kawas and got directions on where to find Lunaria. When the aether addict wasn’t cycling aether in a training room, she would be consumed with some experiment or another in her laboratory at the top of the tower. As Amelia was already halfway up the tower, she would check the laboratory above first.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODg0NjJmZmNkOTRjNTdiOGY4OGI2MGJkY2RkMzBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia left the class and headed up the spiral staircase. On the way, any staff member she passed and even a few students nodded in acknowledgement. The news of her domination over Senior Class B spread like wildfire, and even though some students looked at her suspiciously, the majority treated her with growing respect.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjRkYTJhYmE4ODQ4NTZhNGY1ZTkyNDEyMTBhYzdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As Amelia neared the top floor, she was surprised to find that the staircase didn’t end at a landing like the other floors. Instead, it coiled upwards through the ceiling, tapering into a steep staircase that ended at a large wooden door. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Even before getting too close, Amelia sensed Lunaria's presence inside; the room was shielded with sound and aether muffling measures, yet with just a touch of focus, Amelia could easily recognise Lunaria’s familiar aether signature.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGNjMmVhZTVjOTQ2ZjhiYjM2ZGU5M2UzZTlhMDM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as she could detect Lunaria, the aether addict could detect her back. The demon’s voice could be heard from somewhere above, telling her to come right in. Amelia happily obliged, and with a cheerful, ‘excuse me!’, she opened the door, climbing up the last few steps into Lunaria’s laboratory.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjY4MWU2MmQ3MDRkNmJiOWI3OGU5MDA0ZGI0NmY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Initially, Amelia noticed countless unique aether signatures scattered throughout her surroundings. Various cut crystals in different shapes and sizes were employed to harness and direct aether across numerous experiments. Crystals floated over copper-hued metal plates, others heated liquids, and some sparked electricity between them. Many crystals exhibited intricate cuts that exceeded what Amelia learned in yesterday's crystal-craft lecture.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjI1MDk4MTJjYjQ1NWJiODE3MWVmYzI4NWY2MTU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the center of the room, an enormous telescope, perhaps ten meters long, pointed at an opening in the ceiling. Lunaria must have taken over the tower's observatory and turned it into her laboratory.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzQxNTViZjQxMzRjNjI5YmE5Y2E5OTZhMmMwZWI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The instructor in question stepped out from a pile of books and glassware. Unlike the first time they met, Lunaria wasn’t running any glamors. The demon’s silver hair and creased eyes gave her an aged, wise appearance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTlkYjM1M2VjMjRlYzI5NzFhMTEzZWYzMzZhMDg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Feel free to have a look,” Lunaria said, gesturing towards the telescope. “Should still be pointed at the moon.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2E3ZjRiMWE3NDQwOWJiZjkzZTIyYjBkNWVjZTA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I?” Amelia replied with a grin. She walked over to the telescope and bent down to look through the eyepiece. Through it, she was greeted with the sight of the brilliant blue moon. The supernatural object gave off an ethereal lustre that was noticeable though it was daytime.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDkwNDNhYzIxZTQwYzM4NmQ1N2Q0ZmE0MTI5NmNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The surface, as best as she could see, varied heavily in terrain. Some parts of the moon’s surface shone brighter, while others were duller. She guessed this was due to different amounts of rock and crystal. Rimming the moon were thousands of smaller lights, too small to be seen even through the telescope.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzBlODcxNzllZDRkM2RhMWU5YTgwOWU4ZTAwZDQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are the lights surrounding it the crystals breaking off, ready to fall?” Amelia asked, not looking up from the telescope. Something about the moon made her want to keep looking, subtly pulling her attention.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODZlMjQxN2YyNjQ5ODY5Y2U2NzhkZTc2MzdkOWUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” came Lunaria’s reply. “The moons are constantly growing, and when the Chernykh limit is reached, the surplus tephra is ejected by the subsurface aethermagmatic activity.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjM3YzZlZGU5ODQ2NjZiZTEzOTYwOTlkYjIyZTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re constantly growing!?” Amelia exclaimed, bringing her head up and looking at Lunaria. “How’s that possible? Where does the mass come from?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGU1ZmJkN2UxODQ3YmFiZmE3NDBkMmE5YjcxMTQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if you figure that out, you’ll earn yourself a Golden Eagle,” Lunaria intoned with a smile. “They’re not considered </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">supernatural</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> for nothing.” The demon approached the telescope, producing a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">click</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as she flipped a lever. Lunaria gestured towards the eyepiece, saying, “Look again, do you see the two lines on the lens?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2MzMmExNGI1MDQ5MzBiN2Q5M2ZmMGU0YTA5ODli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia put her eye against the telescope's eyepiece. Whatever Lunaria did caused two thin vertical lines to appear. They were slightly inside the left and right edges of the moon. To the left of the first line were numbers.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWE2MzU1NmZiYzRmNDhhY2ZlZTNmZGFhNWU1YjY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One three six,” Amelia mumbled. “What do they mean?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTg3NTc0MTRjNTQ3YmFiNmQxNDNmMjNlNmExN2Fi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Distance,” Lunaria replied pointedly. “One hundred and thirty-six thousand kilometres. It measures the distance of the moon from our surface. Use the controls next to your right hand to adjust the lines. The controls by your left hand adjust the telescope's aim, magnification and focus. Adjust it so the moon fits perfectly between the two lines and read out the number.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDFiMzliMmE5ODRlMmM4MzdmYjRhNmQxZTIyYmRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure!” Amelia set about testing the different controls and seeing which ones did what. It took less than a minute for her to adjust the lines so they neatly hugged the blue moon. As the lines moved or the telescope’s magnification changed, so did the numbers. “One two nine,” she read out. Amelia looked up from the eyepiece to see Lunaria writing on a blackboard, adding the value to the end of a long list of descending measurements.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWIxOWQwZjdhNjRmZjFiYWQ5ZTZiZTdlNmI4MWEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Slowing down,” Lunaria intoned, “Another day or two, it’ll reach its perigee. Then it’ll be about sixty-eight hours till the moonrain hits us.” The instructor turned to face Amelia. “You’re welcome to view it from up here; the viewing towers in the city are often crowded unless you spend enough money.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGI1NWNmOWFhZDRhZWM5MTExYjFjNjE4MzA1NjU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll think about it!” Amelia chirped, looking at the tables of measurements on the blackboard. “Is it a hobby then, this…” Amelia hesitated, trying to find the right word. “...this moonwatching?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDcwZWRmYmEyODQwY2U4YzE2ZjlkOWVkY2ZkN2Q4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Partially,” Lunaria replied with a nod. “I often run sensitive experiments up here, and the moon's proximity needs to be factored into the aether measurements, as well as any nearby lumina storms. I also monitor any abnormal volcanism on the moon. I have a friend in Centralis studying it, so I send him my sightings.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Njc3ZDVkNmM4NTRmMjViNDYxNDgyZWMwMDIzZjE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of abnormal activity do you look out for?”</span></p><span class="cmI4YmZkZmVjNGFjZDQxZDNhMmQ3YTU1ZjJiZjg3MGEx"><br/>Stolen story; please report.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyM2M2Nzc3MGFkNDQyNDI5N2IyMzQ3OWY1MzA2NjY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The kind that throws a big enough aetherlith at us that risks devastating an area. Even though they slow down as they get closer to the lumina, anything more than a hundred meters in diameter will impart a lot of energy when it impacts. We don’t want them to hit a populated area.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2EyODkyZWU3MTRjNTQ5MzM3OGQxZTYxMTI0ZWJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Amelia nodded. “What’s an aetherlith?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmE0NjE4ZjZkNDRmNTFiZjI2YTQyMDIyNjRiZTk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria tilted her head slightly. “It’s the scientific name for the igneous material that falls during moonrains, produced by the subsurface volcanic activity in the moons.” The instructor paused for a moment. “You don’t have a formal education in this subject?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODM0ZTNkZjIyNjQ0NjY5MThjOGI0NTQ0MzE1MjZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve had an…” Amelia looked to the side awkwardly. “An unusual upbringing. Lots of bits got left out. However!” She thrust out an enthusiastic thumbs up towards the Head Instructor. “That’s partially why I’m here! To catch up on the gaps in my education!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjk5MDBjOWNlNDRhZWY5ZDAyMzA0MjY0MjQ2NmIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Lunaria murmured, rubbing her chin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDViYjQ0NTNjOTQzN2M5NDFjZjMxZWZhOGU0ZTFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what happens if a city is threatened with a collision?” Amelia asked, trying to change the subject away from her ignorance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjQxNjMwZGI0YjQ0MjA4NWNkYmI3ZDRmYzAzMDVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Protecting urban centres from the most serious threats is the domain and sworn responsibility of each Terra Firma’s Overlord,” Lunaria explained. “But an aetherlith event happens rarely. Once every few decades across the entire Empire.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDViNTU1YWYzZjQxM2U4MTRiOGI4ZjkyNjFhN2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose you’ll need someone of an Overlord’s power to deflect or destroy the incoming aetherlith,” Amelia proposed. Seeing Lunaria nod, Amelia took the chance to slide into one of her intended topics. “Speaking of great power…” As she spoke these words, Amelia didn’t miss Lunaria’s eyes glint in anticipation. The instructor truly was an aether addict! “When I invoked certain Words, I saw something I had never seen before… There seemed to be some kind of…” Amelia paused, placing one horizontal palm against her other one, “...Some kind of layered reality, or realm, or something. It was as if there were two Cascadias, one hidden away somehow. I also detected powerful aether signatures in this other place, and I think they could detect me. Do you…” She shuffled her feet a little. “Know what that is?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmUwYTczZDRkZjQ1Zjg5ZWJkZjk2ZmE3OGRlODBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria didn’t reply immediately. Slowly, a wirey smile formed on her face. “I was hoping you could tell me…” the instructor mumbled before walking away. “What you speak of is both known and unknown,” Lunaria called out as she started digging through piles of books. “It’s known that it exists, and that has been known for a long time… ah, here we are!” Lunaria pulled out an old leather-bound book with no title. She motioned for Amelia to join her at a table where she laid the book out, opening it to a bookmarked page.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWQyNDA0NGIwZDQ3Y2RhMjA2YzAwYzZkMWUwM2Ri" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A third-century drawing of the first Greatlord of Kenhoro and Tanhae. A mage and scholar called Sun Simao. The drawing is an abstraction, but look at his commentary.” Lunaria pointed at the text underneath the drawing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDM4NmNhNTcyNTQyYTM5M2Q3YWJiZTlkMTBiYzFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t read Manwese,” Amelia said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWVhNmQwZDVlYzRmZDNhOWQyM2M2YzA1NzNmYTc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, of course,” Lunaria said with an apologetic tone. The demon traced her finger along the Manwese script, reading out loud in a solemn voice, “In realms unseen, my granted divinity unveils the sacred abode of the Kami. Shrouded in the mists of the unknowable, it reveals itself only to those who dare reach the pinnacle of their celestial endowment. Here, in this veiled sanctuary, the Kami watch and I stand beneath their gaze, a lone mortal among the divine.” Lunaria raised a hand, coughly quietly. “And then he continues to blather on about Kami for a while. You’ve spent some time in Kenhoro. You’re familiar with it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjdkYmNjOTYyYTQ5YmNhNmM3NTU2N2I2ZmJhMTQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded quickly. “Right! So is that’s what it is? The realm of the Kami?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTNjNDZiYmMxZjRjODNhY2I0NzI5ZmIwNmY1OWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably not,” Lunaria replied with a shrug, raising one palm to her side. “There’s a document recording a Northern Greatlord making a similar observation in the early fourth century, although he ascribes it to the realm of spirits, where they wait until they can cross into the ice and be born as ice golems.” Lunaria tilted her head, raising the other palm. “A few decades later, one of the desert Greatlords channels enough aether to see the same thing, only this time they think it’s the dominion of the Wagi, which is their name for the insect gods they worship.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDdhZmVjNzllMTQxZmM4YjdhYWUzYzNkZjU4ZjY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria began counting with her fingers. “Other theories include but are not limited to…” The demon took a breath. “It’s the first of the Seven Hells; it’s the utopia talked about in Murian scripture; it’s a prison for the banished souls of the Enemy during the Long Discordancy; it’s the aetherfield manifesting its own reality or the source of aether itself; it’s the home of any number of Kami, spirits, or Formless. Uh…” Lunaria paused for a moment. “Oh, and there were some fifth-century philosophers popular in Centralis, claiming it was the realm of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">perfect forms</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that are ideal representations of all objects in the real world, unaffected by the flux and impermanence of the physical world.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWVlNzE4M2I4MTQwNzY4ODBmY2IwNzQ3MTk3ZmYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you’re saying…” Amelia said, feeling a little bit disappointed. “No one knows?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzM5ODBkMjRjNzQwYTE5NmFiM2ZmOTliYTQwN2Mw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh!” Lunaria exclaimed, “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> knows for sure. There’s an Imperial decree that any investigation or produced material regarding it must pass review by Centralis authorities first. So </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">someone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> knows more than anyone else, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">someone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> doesn’t want information about it getting out.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmEzNzJlM2ZjYzRkMTQ5ZWEyZGY2MzcyZTQzMDQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When you say </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">someone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Amelia said, pointing a finger upwards. “You mean the Empress, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmI2OGJlOTUyODRkZjA5NmQ5YzZmMzM5OGZlNTk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe. Likely. My guess is whatever it is either has divine or military applications,” Lunaria said with a shrug. “But there’s one thing that’s very interesting…” Lunaria whispered, leaning in closely. “Is that in the decree written by the Empress, she refers to it as the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimmer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">; a word that, as far as I know, appears for the first time in that document. Make of that what you will…</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmM0YjEwNmIwNjRiMDA4YzI5MGRjMmQ2ZDE5OTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t lie,” Lunaria continued. “A large part of the reason why I practice channelling so much aether is to unveil this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimmer better</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. One thing is certain: the more aether localised in an area, the thinner the boundary between this reality and that one. I only wonder…” Lunaria’s voice quietened. “With enough aether, could someone cross into this other place? What would happen if they did?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmFjYzg3NTYxNDRhM2NiNjhhMWVkOTc2MWEwMWQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe one day we’ll find out…” Amelia replied with a nervous grin. If the quantity of aether was all that was required to break down the boundaries between the two realities, then what would happen if Amelia truly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">let loose</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? Would she be able to cross into this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimmer?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Or would something terrible happen? Would those creatures on the other side be able to come through into Cascadia?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTM0NmRiNjZjODQ3NTc4YTczZmM2M2UyY2JiNGFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She would have to be careful.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzM0YmU1YjdiOTRjYWVhYmE1NDZkMTdiMGYxYTI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One more thing…” Amelia continued, “You mentioned some people theorise the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimmer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is the realm of the Formless.” Seeing Lunaria nod, Amelia asked, “Can you explain to me what you know of them? The Formless? I never really, uh…” She rubbed the back of her neck, looking to the side. “Never really learned about them in any detail.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzlkMDIxNmVkOTRmZDQ5MzYwNjZmY2Y5ZWE5NWE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at you,” Lunaria replied, smiling as she crossed her arms. “Coming up here and bringing up mystery after mystery. As for the Formless… you’ve been sailing on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> haven’t you? It’s well-known that a Formless called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Anathor</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> lives on the ship, bound to serve its captain. I would be interested in what </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> could tell me about </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">him</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWM5NjA3OGFmMDRiYTFiNDUzMWYyZmFlMGYxNGY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…” Amelia was about to start blabbering, caught in excitement, but she managed to stop herself. “I don’t think I’m allowed. It’s a military vessel, and Serena would probably throw me overboard if I talked casually about its secrets… I was hoping to ask about them in general…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjNhN2UxYzY0ZjRlNWM5MzhlZWY5ODg1MWE5YjU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria shrugged, seemingly taking no offence at Amelia’s refusal to elaborate on Anathor. “As with the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimmer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, no one truly knows; if they did, they aren’t sharing. However, we know a few things.” The demon raised one aged finger. “Intelligence. The Formless vary in sentience. Some barely react to stimuli, while others will happily converse with you. Two, permanence and impermanence. The Formless can pass through physical objects, essentially allowing them to fly. However, they still obey the laws of aether. Wards can halt them, and if some reports are to be believed, they can be harmed with magic and aura. Imperial decree forbids aggressive action towards them, although you may defend yourself if necessary. To my knowledge, such a need has never arisen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2IxMTllZWExOTRiNTc4OGMwNmFlNWQzYmJkMTQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria took a breath, raising a third finger. “Three, their origins. The first </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">clear</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> records of them began shortly after the Empress prevailed against the Enemy. There are older records that survived the Long Discordancy, but we’re not sure if they refer to the Formless or something else. As for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">what</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> they are, you have theories of everything from desert Djinn to Northern Spirits to Kami to gods and everything in between.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTMyYmIwMDhlMjQ2NDZhNjRkYTNlM2E1OTNhOWI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can’t we just ask them where they come from? Or what they are?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGMxN2Q3MTE0ZDRiOTRhM2I4ZjJhZWE1MDNmZTE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They don’t know,” Lunaria replied. “They always have the same answer; they don’t know or can’t remember. Either they coordinate their deception, or none of the Formless knows how they came to be. The prevailing theory in the academic community is that they used to be human or demon, and then </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">some</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> event turned them into what they are now. Some seem to have memories of when they were alive, or rather…” Lunaria’s brow furrowed. “When they were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">more</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> alive.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWMxNmY3NmYxYjQzZDdiYzc0OTVmZTlhOWYyN2Fj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many are there?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDMzZTYyZDRkNzRhNjNhNjQwYmEzMTVmYzc4YjMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are forty-two Formless that we either know of directly or have hints of their existence. All that have been able to give their name have matched the list.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTczMzM3ODJmMzQ0MjhhYTY1M2E0ODZlNjgyMmM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s a list?” Amelia replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTlhNDQ5NWI2MzRkMTA5MzRiZjEwZGJmMzA0NDQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Etched in Anglish in the Cathedral of Bone. I can’t remember if it's been dated to any era, but it’s been there a while. Here.. I have a copy of it somewhere around here…” Lunaria delved into the stacks of books and a moment later reappeared clutching a thin tome. “Here we are! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">The Formless:</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sightings and Conversations</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">." The instructor flipped to one of the earlier pages. ”On the left is a sketch of the original slab, but that’s in Old Anglish. On the right is the Imperial translation.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTc2Yjc1NmM3MzQzNjY4ZGViOWI3Y2E1ZDM1YzNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia looked at the drawing. She could read Old Anglish just fine; it was her mother tongue after all. Still, she suspected revealing that to Lunaria might not be best, so she forced herself to read from the Imperial translation. The list contained forty-two names. Strangely, every Formless lacked a surname and had unusual titles.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODk4ZDRmMGRkYjQ2Zjc4YWZlZDMyNDQyOGZhYjNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Diego the Wanderer,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Amelia muttered, reading one of the names out loud. “I guess he travels around?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmUwNjQ4Nzc5NDRmMGNiNDExMDA3MmFkZTU1MGNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly. Quite a friendly Formless as well. There are plenty of recorded conversations with him throughout the centuries, not just in Cascadia. Last decade, he stopped by a Federation land transport while they cooked lunch and discussed new culinary techniques.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzUzM2M5ODNlNzRhZDY4ZWViNTQ4MWE0NGUwYWY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously?” Amelia raised an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjllM2I5ZDg2ODQzNGNiZjNkMmVmMDM3NTdjMWQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously. Many of them carry nicknames based on their behaviour and actions.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTQ1NjgzYThiOTQ0Zjc5MTU3M2U5YTZiYjU3NGY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So this… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Chandra the Philosopher</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDE0ZGJkMjdlMjRiYmVhZWEyMWYzNTRlNjhkYmE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Once refused to let a Highlord sleep for three days until they finished their debate about utilitarian ethical frameworks.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzljNGQ3ZGRiMjRjMDM5ZDZmMDQ3N2M4NzBlZTUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sindr the Savior</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGIxYjYzYzE0OTRmM2FhNDJjY2FhMjYxMzNiNzY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Known to lead troubled airships through storms and other problematic situations. Takes the form of a glowing ball of light.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTk0NzYyMzE4MDQ5ZWM4MGUyYjc2OTJiNDczNzkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia scanned the list and looked for Anathor. “Some of the names and titles are cut off,” she pointed out.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzAxNDdlZTcyNTQ3NGI5MGQ1NGMwNTc0ZDk3Yjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The slab was broken at some point. Unless there’s another record somewhere, we only know the first few letters of some of them. Some have been encountered and verified their names and titles, but some have refused to elaborate.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzRmYjg2NjliYTQ2Yzc4ZWNmZTM0NjJhMmM3ZGZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia read the broken list. Alongside the missing names were comments by the book’s author.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWU0ZWJjNmNmZjQ3MGE5MTQ4YTA1MGQyY2ZhZWJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Idalia the Gent- (Assumed Gentle or Gentleman. Never Encountered.)</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiYjRmN2M5NTFhYzQzMDk4MDA3ZmQzYjA5MTU1NDhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Savia the- (Unknown title. Non-verbal. Two interactions, see p29 and p53)</span></em></p>

<p class="cnNlY2IyNWIxMThhZjQ4NmY5Njk4Nzk5ZDA2MGVjMDc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, one final name that was obscured by the slab's damage.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGM4NTRhZGU3ODRlMzk5YTVkYWEwN2IzZjYzOTBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Anathor the K- (Unknown title, existence confirmed through Centralis Intelligence in 630 AV. See p60)</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiMTRiYmMyNzZjMjQ0OGY4OWVjYTUxMmZhMmU5MDBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anathor… the Kind?” Amelia muttered. That would fit. Anathor was challenging to talk to sometimes, but he was always courteous to everyone on the ship. Would he know what his title was if she asked him? He wouldn’t get angry if she poked a little, would he?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDUxMThiMTFhOTQ3OTk4YmMwZTIxODllYzc4ZDZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Kind?” Lunaria questioned. “Do you know?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjJkY2M4Nzg1NzRiMTY5ZjlmMjQxYTNhNGExNzY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, sorry, just guessing.” Amelia shook her head before tapping the book. “Can I take this? I’d like to read about the interactions people have had. The Formless are spoken about with such superstition by the sailors and the public. I want to understand them more.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWZlMDQ1YzE4ZDRkOWJhYTFlYWMzZjY2NWU2MGE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a problem,” Lunaria said with a smile. “Is there anything else you wanted to ask?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2EzMjg4ZWUxYTRlMjY4ZTRjN2U0OWZkZWQzNmI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thank you,” Amelia flashed her best smile and gave Lunaria a bow. “You’ve been so helpful! Thanks for your time, Lunaria!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGI4ZTJkZmRkZjQzYjI4Zjg2Njk2NDBmMDI0NzJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you’re very welcome…” Lunaria waved a hand dismissively. “That said, I have some future experiments planned, which will require an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">awful</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> amount of aether for a prolonged period of time. Would you be willing to help an old lady?” A dangerous glint appeared in the demon’s eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTQ1OWZhOTI5YzQxNWJhYmI4MDU5ZTczMWI5ODhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of experiments would this crazy aether addict want Amelia for?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjE3ZTk5Yzk5ODQ4Y2JiZDQ5N2ZlYmY4MTkwN2Ni" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, sure thing!” Amelia chirped.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzdlZjRlYjViYzQ5ZTliNWZlYWMzNzg0YTJmY2Mz" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">She wouldn’t come to regret that answer, would she?</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Fifty-Six: In Asamaywa's Shadow</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNiNDNlNjAxMGMyZjRlNzc4ZjBmNWM1MDQ3M2M2ZTI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Noburu POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/noburu.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWQyOTljZDhmODRjMTQ5OTBkMDBjY2JjMWIxZjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu shivered against the bitter lowland weather. He hugged himself, preserving his body heat, covering the holes in his tattered clothes and hiding the package he carried. He had warmer clothes hidden away, but Noburu didn’t dare wear them outside. Winter was when people got desperate, and if Noburu wanted to keep pretending he was the same as everyone else, he couldn’t afford to be seen as possessing too much wealth.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTNhNTI4OWFlNjQ4MjVhOGE3MzQ1ODM0MWY3YjFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that he was wealthy. Noburu, like the majority of the slum-dwellers, was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">poor</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Down here in the narrow streets winding between ramshackle buildings, if your coin purse were seen holding more than a few scraps of copper, it wouldn’t be long before a cutthroat or guard would follow you with less than honourable intentions.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGFhNzE4Zjc4NjQwMDhhNjkxZjNiODdhNTMzNTlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Often, they were the same person.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGViYmE4ZmNkNDRkNGNiOTc5ZjNmOWU3NmM4MWRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t a difference in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wealth </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">that discriminated Noburu from the rest of the slum. It was his </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">spirit</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The people down here had long since given up on a better life. They would beg, steal or otherwise take what they wanted, spend it all on cheap ale and then repeat the process day after day, all while cursing at the better-born who lived in the great city above them. They would tell tales of how one day they would become a lord-prospect, or find a job in some rich merchant’s estate, but deep down, they didn’t believe it. They didn’t have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hope</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. They weren’t Noburu. They weren’t determined to better themselves.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDE0Mzc5NWQ3NzQxZWQ4ZWI5MDM4ZWM2NDIzOTQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked up, noticing today's low clouds obscured his view of Asamaywa above. Was someone up there, looking down at him right now? What thoughts crossed their mind upon seeing the slums clinging to the cliffs of the plateau? Maybe they ignored the view down, focusing instead on ships arriving at the dock or the lush farmland and wilderness beyond. After all, why would anyone gaze at Asamaywa’s shadow when brighter sights were available?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzliN2E5YmRlMDQwNDE5YzcwZDIwZTkzNjU4ZjAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He caught the sound of men talking. Looking down, Noburu saw a group of guards mingling at the end of the street, between him and his route. Damn them! Down here, if you rolled a bad set of dice, a group of guards was no less dangerous than a gang. Noburu darted into an unfamiliar alley, hugging the package close. It wasn’t a package he could let the guards find.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWU3MzdhNzcwMjRhMjdiODhmZGY2ZTkwZjY5MjAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">His movements must have caught their eye, for he heard a command for him to stop. Noburu quickened his pace, turning the only corner to find the alley came to a dead end. It was too late to turn around; the guard's footsteps were entering the alley behind him. He looked around frantically for an escape. Tall wooden walls surrounded him. There wasn’t even a drainpipe to climb. Some gangs kept hidden ropes in the dead-end alleys, but if there was one, Noburu couldn’t find it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWMyYmNmZDc5ODRhOGE4MTdmNTZlOWZjM2Y1YmJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn it! Damn them!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjA3MWVlYzhjMTQ2NzBiNWFmYWM4MzI5NjFkYzJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu backed against the far wall, sliding down and pulling his feet in to shrink as much as possible. As the guards turned the corner, Noburu took a deep breath, activated his blessing, and slipped into the ghost world.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzBmN2Y0ZDRhNDRhNmQ4YzEwZTc3ZTQzOWQxZWYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The world took on a reddish-brown, and an uncomfortable squeezing sensation began forming in his chest. Time slowed, and the guards hurrying after him now moved sluggishly. Their outlines were blurred, glowing slightly like all living things in this strange place. They called after him, but the sound was distant and muffled as if they were shouting over a great distance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmFlNThjYmExNDQ4NDJhMDRiNzUxNzA0NTBmNDAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The alley's roughly-hewn wooden walls were now covered in ghostly purple vines. The guards couldn’t see the ethereal plant life, just as they couldn’t see Noburu. As they paced the alley, the vines pulled away from their presence. Some larger vines couldn’t move away and brushed against the guards’ faces. Despite this, the guards didn’t react.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGM5NDhlZjZjMzRlMjE4Yjg0YzA4YTc3MDMxMzM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">You couldn’t feel the vines if you couldn’t see them. In some cases, Noburu had seen them pass right through another person. They were like ghosts, only loosely holding onto the physical world. For this reason, Noburu called this mysterious plane of existence the ghost world and the vines ghost vines.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDk3OTFmZjc4ZDRmZDg4NmMzODY5NTVkMmYzZmIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where in the seven hells did he go!?” one of the guards called, his voice sounding lower than it should due to the slower passage of time. They fanned out and scoured the alley, finding nothing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTJjZmU5N2Y0NzRmNDU4NjJiZWJmNTljYmVhNDRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rope or a false wall, I reckon,” another guard said, kicking at some of the wooden panelling. “He’ll be far away by now.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTg1ZDA1OTUyODQzOWVhMGQwOTYwYWRiMzQ2OGYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Little rat scurried off. Leave ‘im!” A guard spat on the floor right next to where Noburu was hiding before turning and walking away. The guards left the alley. Noburu waited until the burning sensation in his chest forced him to exhale, pushing him out of the ghost world and back into reality.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDE2NTE2MDdhNTRjOTY4ZjI3NDk5YTI3MGVkODZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the ghost world, he could breathe if he had to, but it made him sick.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDZjN2Y0NmE4NTQ2ZmU4YzMxM2I5MWJkZDEwMTU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He gasped for breath. The smell of something burning filled the alley. Exhaustion racked his body. His stomach gnawed at him. He was ravenous. Something about his blessing used up his energy. Noburu reached into a pocket and pulled out a bit of leftover bread. He was going to give it to one of the children, but now he needed it more.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTk5ZjY0NGRhMDQ4NWFhMzhjMTNjZTU3MDNlNDAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He took a moment to chew the bread and steady his breath. His ears remained sharp, prepared to use his blessing again if someone came into the alley. Fortunately, he wasn’t interrupted and soon got back on his feet, feeling his strength return. Stealthily approaching the alley’s opening, Noburu glanced around the corner. The guards had left.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjg0NjQ3OTQwMDQ5MTRiMWRhOGRmOGJjMmNjZDM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling relieved, he pressed on through the slums until he arrived at his destination. Before him stood a building that was sturdier than most: it featured a stone foundation, ironwood supports, double-planked walls, and fired clay tiles. When it was originally constructed, it must have appeared magnificent. However, now the walls bore poorly patched holes, and half of the roof depended on makeshift fixes to prevent the rain from getting in.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTI5NDkxYWEzODQ2NmQ5NmZlNzdhMmM3MjQ0ZTcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The orphanage stood at the end of the street, surrounded by a tall wall that created a safe play area for the children. It was Noburu’s residence, where he and his sister had spent most of their lives. After the owner died, he somehow became responsible for managing the orphanage. Although he didn't seek this duty, he felt there was nothing else he could do; the children depended on him for their hope.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDc0MjdhOGZiOTQ3NzU4NjEwNmIwMGFkMGI5ZmRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He tapped out the agreed-upon pattern on the heavy door. “It’s me!” he shouted.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjlkZDI1MTIxNTRmNmJhNGRkYzZlMmQ4MTQ1ZjY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who’s ‘me’!?” a young boy’s voice responded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmQxYzRiZjhkMzQ0MDk4ZDM3MWEyYTliNGVjZjA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me who won’t be able to give you this sugarfruit if you don’t let me in!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTU1M2ZiNjA0ZTQyMmY4MDRlNTY0MjU0NjBjODkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jubilant shouts sounded from beyond the door, and after some scrambling, the heavy iron bolts were pulled back and the door opened. A gaggle of children, wearing patchy clothing and with dirty faces, looked with eyes wide in anticipation. Those excited faces quickly turned into frowns as they saw no sign of the promised fruit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjEwNjljZDE1ZjQxMzdiZjQzZjFiYzQzZmZkMmZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Liar!” Mira, one of the girls, shouted, pointing at him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjhjYmUzZDZjNjQ5NTM4YzliMzEzYmM1YTZlZTNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here,” Noburu said, fishing a small coin out of his pocket and flicking it to her. “Go to the market and bring back half a dozen. Don’t let them short-change you, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGUxYTMwMzEyNTQ0ZGM5YjJkNjg0YzcxNzc5ZDlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The children, four boys and two girls, cheered happily, racing out the doorway. “Stick together!” He called after them. “Bring one back for your sister!” Noburu hesitated for a moment before adding, “And one for me!” Normally, Noburu would do without the rare treat, but he wanted to get some energy back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGJiMjRiYzU1NTQ2MDlhZGE5YTVmMDU1YWM1ODdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He watched them skip down the street, laughing joyfully. He stepped into the orphanage, shutting and locking the door behind him. He moved down the hallway before turning into the largest room in the building. There, he found Kiku, his younger sister and the only blood-related family left, piling kindling against the wall.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWZlNzUwMDk4NDRhNWRhYjMyMWVlYmJiNGUxYzU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The room was originally the orphanage's dining room, but it had long since been converted to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">everything-</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">room. In this room, they ate, worked, played, and slept. The beds had been moved down here, while the dining table, once polished and shiny, now scratched and full of splinters, had been shoved against one side. This room held their stores of food and wood, material for their work, and anything else. At the end of the room, a clean area was maintained for cooking. The crystal-fuelled oven had long been dormant; instead, they had a gas stove they sparingly used.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTUyNjk4NzVkOTRhOTBhMTA2Y2JjMzAzYjZlMjU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This room had become the everything room due to the wood burner installed against one of the walls. By staying in one room, they could manage their meagre stockpiles of wood throughout the winter. During the cold months, the warmer you were, the less food you needed and the more you could work.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGY3YjYzYTFhNTQ3M2E4NTMzNjNiY2FlM2UwZDBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enough for winter?” Noburu said, gesturing to the stacked wood.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmYwMTcwM2ZhNzQwZTdhM2U0ZDg1NTE5ZTEzMjg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Might need to buy a little more,” Kiku said, standing and facing him. She dusted her dirty knees. “But we can afford that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">if</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you stop buying the children sugarfruit.” Kiku tilted her head in disapproval. “What’s that?” she asked, eyes narrowing as she spotted the package.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzdjOGQxNDljYjQwZmI4ZGNkZjA4YzNlNjA5NDJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu took the package out, placing it gently on the table. “Clothes,” he said. “From Yoshiro.” He winced slightly, anticipating the argument. His sister examined the package, peeking inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmUwNGU5MWI4YTQ4Yzc4ZjlhOTU0YjBhODg2OTUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A disguise? You went to see Yoshiro?” she asked. When he nodded, she shook her head, gritting her teeth. “You don’t need to do this anymore! You don’t need to work for him!” Kiku grabbed Noburu’s hands, pulling them towards her. “What are you going to lose next time? A hand? You only have so many fingers!” She caressed his hands. His right hand was whole, but his left was missing the last two digits.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODIxZTVhNGE3NDRiODY5NGUyOTg4YzhjOGUzYmM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Punishment for theft.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGVhZjJjMzYwMTRkMDRhOWI5ZDNjNjE3NmVkYzAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have enough for winter!” Kiku snapped. “The children are all working now! Reo and Riki are doing more and more, and Shu is learning! Why risk it all!? What we have is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">working</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjMxNThhNzJhMTQ5NDM4MDIzMWRhN2I2NmY5ZmFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What we have is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">surviving</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!” Noburu hissed, frustration dripping from his voice. “We can do so much more! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> can do so much more! We might limp through this winter, but what about next? What if Yasuji demands more protection money? What if one of the kids gets injured? We are…” Noburu held up two fingers. “...</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> close to collapsing. One disaster is all it takes, but… but!” He held up the package of fine clothes. “A hundred denarii! A </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hundred</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> if I do this for Yoshiro! Imagine what we could do with that! We could buy proper materials for the kids. Proper equipment! We could eat better! Get the children some apprenticeships! We could pay to have your condition looked at!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDk3MzZjMjk0ZjRhZmZhM2RjYTdlMDAxZDZkYTA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kiku had a weak constitution. She struggled to walk for long distances and rarely left the orphanage. Sometimes, she would have coughing fits and lay feverishly in bed for days. The hope that Noburu clung to was mainly for her. She didn’t deserve this life; none of them did. The thought of continuing to just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">exist</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in this place made Noburu sick. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjEwNzc5Y2E4ZTQ0ZTNhZWQ2MzY0N2IwZjQ2ZGQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We wouldn’t be able to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">survive</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> without you!” Kiku countered, jabbing his chest with a finger. “Damn you! I know that look in your eye. You’ve already agreed to it, haven’t you!?” She waved to the package. She was correct; Noburu had been given the clothes only after Yoshiro agreed to the task set out for him. “What is it then? At least tell me!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTZkMWUxZjZiYjQ2MThhOWZlODVjZTMzOWYxYjg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look!” Noburu opened the package more, revealing the neat uniform underneath. “Seonmi and I are going as restorationists. It’s all been organised already. We’ll go in and snatch a few artefacts, and we’ll be back before you know it! We’ve got the tools and everything. It’s the perfect con! Who’s going to suspect someone of pretending to be that!?”</span></p><span class="cjJhNDkxNGM0ZjM0NTQyZTQ4ZTE1NDEzOWMzMmFlMTJj"><br/>This story originates from Royal Road.

<p class="cnMxYzAxZTM5YjkwNTQ2MzY4Y2Q2MmU4OWFlMjNmOGIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where? Up above!?” Kiku crossed her arms. “Some lord’s estate? Stealing from </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">nobility</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!? Are your horns blocking common sense from reaching your brain!?” She leaned forward, flicking one of his horns. “The Asamaywa city guards are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">proper</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> warriors! They’re not like the honourless bastards down here! They can use </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">aura</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! You won’t be able to bribe your way out up there if you get caught! They are loyal to their Lord! Well then, who is it!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjc0OTdhMzM4NzQ4NWFhOGRiYTBiZjBiZGM1Mjgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who?”</span></p>

I swear to the Empress herself, if the next words out your mouth include the name ‘Greatlord Oshiro’, I’m going to hang you myself!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODNlOWFmY2JjYjQ0NzQ5MDNjNGQ5YmIzYzU3M2I4" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZGI4NDJkOThiYzQ0Y2E5M2MwMTViOWMzYzQwOTYy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn’t,” he said reassuringly, shaking his head. “It’s not a specific Lord. It’s one of the academies. They keep all kinds of famous weapons on display. That’s what-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDFlNjQ1NDM1NDQzOTU5MmYyMTZlMzEyNTZkMjQw" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNTUyNzQxOTBhYzQ0ZTM5ZDZhYzRjNjk2NGY5ODY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">great</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Kiku interrupted, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “What a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">great</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> idea. Let’s steal from one of the few places in the city where aura users </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">congregate</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. You know aura doesn’t just make you stronger, right!? It enhances their perception, too! They’ll hear every action you take! How are you going to explain your left hand!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGM2ZmM5ODVkZTRkZDE4OGZkZjk4MDlmNTBmOTUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll explain it as an accident during my apprenticeship! Look,” Noburu took a breath, reaching out and grasping his sister's horns. He looked into her crimson eyes, brimming with tears of frustration, and said, “It’s all worked out. Yoshiro has got identification cards and everything!” Noburu pointed to the package. “It’s a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">real</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> uniform from a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">real</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> company. It’ll all check out. He’s been working on this for a while!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGI2ZDZlYmU4MjRlYmRiZTBkYmM3MzhjMDdmNTIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? Why can’t he get anyone-” Kiku trailed off, stopping to catch her breath. She sat down on a chair, closing her eyes. Noburu knelt down, grabbing ahold of her hands.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzAzY2M1MTgxOTQ1MDU4ZTI1NWIzNzEwZjlmYmE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Slow down,” he said. “Yoshiro knows what I can do. And the colour of my eyes let’s me bluff my way into places anyone else would be turned away from! It doesn’t matter if they can use aura, magic, or anything else. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> can hide from them.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmU5YmEwODFjODRmZTdhZDJlN2FmYTQwNGQzNWI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We don’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">know</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that,” Kiku protested. “Can’t you say no?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTQ5ZTNjYzk1NDQ3ZjI5Mjk4MTZlMGQxMmYxOGU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t walk away from people like Yoshiro,” Noburu said softly. “I want a better future for us. I want us to be rich! Remember my promise?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTQxMGQyODg1ZDRiYjk4ZDhkMWM5OWM5ZDk0ZWYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noburu…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODBkMTk2MDFjNDRjNjNhOWNmOGYxMjg4NDU3NmE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you remember? Kiku, do you?” Noburu stared at his sister with steely determination. Kiku met his gaze, and eventually, something within her gave way. She sighed, waving him off. She wiped her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzcwM2NkYjY5ZjQ3ZmU4YmU5N2ZkNGI0MDEwZWEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I do.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmVhN2Y3OWY3YjQwNWI5ZmNjMDJiYWQ4MDM3ZTQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll make it happen. I promise! I won’t give up!” He fetched a tattered blanket, wrapping it around his sister. “Why aren’t you wearing my furs…” he mumbled. One of the most expensive possessions he owned was a fur coat. It wasn’t something he could be seen outside in, nor did he want to sell it. During the winter months Kiku and the children took turns wearing it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGFlMzU4ZGQ2ZTQ1MzI5MTZhNDQ2ZTM0YjdhYjg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t want to get it dirty…” Kiku answered with a weak smile. “Help me up,” she said, holding her hand out. With his assistance, she stumbled to her feet. “You should hide that; the children will be back soon,” she said, pointing to the package. Noburu hid it under their mattress. Kiku took a few hesitant steps, her momentary weakness fading.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWYxYjZiZWI1YTRhMTdiMjY3NGQyMjIzMTJhMTY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A rapid knock sounded from the front door. Recognising the sequence, Noburu headed down the hallway and opened the door. The children tumbled in, cheerfully holding onto their spoils. Noburu closed the door and looked them over.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjNjZDE0M2JmNDQwYTE4NDMwN2U5OTMzNDE3N2Nj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Any trouble?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDY5N2U2ODlhYTRkMTk4YzZmODBlYWFiNmMxODJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yasuji saw us in the market!” Chiho, the eldest of the children, explained. “He asked me if you were back, but I said I didn’t know and that he should come by tomorrow. Then he asked where we got the money to buy the fruit, so we all ran away! He didn’t even try to catch us!” She beamed happily at Noburu, who patted her hair in response.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Yjg4NDBlYzA5MjQ4MWU4YzAyOGUyODBjOWY2NWE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well done,” he said, forcing a smile. Yasuji wouldn’t chase after the kids over a few pieces of copper or sugarfruit. He would, however, likely be on his way here. Yasuji would guess Noburu gave the children some money, which meant he would be good for that month's protection fee. Noburu always tried to put off paying, even if he could afford it. The trick was to make the guards think you were constantly scraping by. Otherwise, they would get ideas about extorting even more from you.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzNhODViNzkxYTQzMmJiZTUwYWJjN2VkMDlkMzZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, then,” he waved the kids in. They ran into the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">everything</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">-room, eagerly showing their spoils to Kiku. Noburu hesitated at the door, watching the joyful expressions on their faces. A treat like this was rare, and it only frustrated Noburu that he couldn’t do it more often.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTUxNmExZmI5YTRiMGFiNDhmMDVjMmUwZTg1ZGYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">After this job, I’ll buy them a mountain of sugarfruits</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, he vowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTdjMjJmZTY0MTRlZjI5MDI2YWYxN2QwN2FkZjQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kiku clapped her hands. “Okay then! Chiho, Tamon, you pull the table out. Miri, get the spoons! Riki, Reo, and Shu, sort the chairs! Go, go!” The children burst into activity, going about their tasks while holding their sugarfruits close. Some of the younger children kept smelling them, excitedly talking about the sweet fragrance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzRkNDZkYmQ3MjQ3Yjc4NTljM2E2NjEwZjhlYmY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With everyone gathered around the table, Noburu sat down. The children tapped their feet in anticipation, and even Kiku eyed her sugarfruit happily. “Now, let’s say a quick grace,” he clasped his hands together, eyeing the other children till they reluctantly followed suit.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmRlMTA4NTBmNTRjZGJhMzJlMDY4YjQyNzA3ZWNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Divine Empress, we thank you for carrying the spirit of Christ. We thank you for your Divine Rule. We thank you for this meal. Bless.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWI3NGRlMzIxMjQ4M2Y4ZDIzNDMzNjVkMDY3NzYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bless,” intoned the group.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWM5NGQ4YTgxZTRiYmU4Y2ViZjg0Yjg3ZjA3Njg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">One by one, Noburu cut the tops off each sugarfruit, revealing the sweet liquid inside. He handed them over, warning the children to wait until everyone was ready. “Don’t drink too fast! It’ll be gone before you know it! Savour every sip!” The children nodded happily. The youngest, Shu, stared at his fruit as if it were worth a thousand denarii.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjgzZWFlNTE3MjRhMWZhODUxYWViYjA3MzFlMjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait!” Kiku exclaimed, putting a hand up. “Who else should we thank? Huh?” She pointed at Noburu. “Give your Big Brother thanks for paying for it and earning money so we can be safe and warm during winter!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTM3NzY3ZGQxNzQ5OTliYTU2ZDA5ZmZkY2QwNmFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Big Brother!” came a chorus of replies.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDk1YzcwYzJhMjRjZWNhNzQ1ZDY4YjA3NGM0NTYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, begin!” Noburu declared. The children delved their spoons into the fruit’s liquid, letting off squeals of satisfaction as they tasted the sweetness. For them, who went months at a time on simple, tasteless porridge and bland vegetables, this was a wonderful experience.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTJlOWNjYTM4NTRjMjY5OWU2YjI5NGM4ODFiYjVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t get over how good this is!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjdlNjE3MDQwZTRiMWFhY2QyOGEwNzRkMzMyZGE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I could eat this for every meal for the rest of my life!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTUwYjJhMzFlMjQxZjNhZjMyZjM0NmQzYzBhOTY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shu, you’re going to spill it; slow down!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2JiM2QzYmFhYzQxNzVhZDI5MDU2OWVhYWUwMzQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember to eat the flesh! Even the rind is good for you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDQ3MDYxNGMzNzQ2MjlhNTAxNzIxNmVlNzE3NjFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite warnings to savour every bit, the sugarfruits were soon devoured. The juice drank, the flesh carved away with spoons, and the bitter rind was chewed and swallowed. Noburu himself found he was lost momentarily in the deliciousness of the meal. He did, however, stop himself from eating the rind, instead letting the children split it between themselves.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjM5MTM4NjhiYzQ5MzFhOTA2MjUxY2RkYTIzYTVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A touch of anger rose within him. Here, the children enjoyed even the bitter rind, eagerly arguing over who deserved the last scraps. How unfair was it that they had to find happiness in this while the better-born would feed the same scraps to their swine? What did that make them?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjMxM2Q1NjdmNTQ0ZGQ5MmNhODlkNjFjZTI5NTFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We heard something in the market!” Chiho announced. “They say a human healer appeared in the city! They say she’s nobility! Maybe if we save money, we can write to her, and have her look at Kiku?” Chiho leaned over and hugged Kiku. “I bet her magic could make you better!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTBkMjU0NzliMzRkZGZiMTE4OWVhMTk3MDAyZGIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Chiho…” Kiku giggled, patting the child’s head. “I don’t think Greatlord Oshiro would sanction a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. All human healers belong to the church, thousands and thousands of kilometres away! Why would one leave the human continent and travel all the way here? The human gods wouldn’t allow it! Besides,” Kiku pumped a fist in the air. “We’re </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">demons</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! We’re stronger and better than those weak humans! I’ll get better, don’t you worry!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzk3YjY3M2ZlMDQ5ZGVhOTgyNjA4OTQ1MGM1ZDQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hurry up, then!” Chiho complained, “I want to play with you like we used to!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWE2YWViNWNiNDRjNDhhYTYxZTU4MTUwM2I1ODQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When we get older, we’ll find work on the farms!” exclaimed Riki, pointing to himself and Reo. “Then we’ll save loads of money and buy the treatment you need!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmMxMTEyNzQ5ZTQ5ZjFhODI2ZjNiNzU5MjUxY2M0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Shu nodded, following along with his siblings. “I’ll learn to knit the best hats! We’ll sell them all!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjE5Y2FmMDVjYTRkZWNiNjg5OWMyZjlkMGNhNjUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmVhZWQ1YWUwYzQ3MzdhYzY2MDIzZjUyZDczZmEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s do it!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGNjM2ZmMjUxNTQ0NmI5YTkyNTY1MTYyY2Y2N2M2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll make Big Sister better!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTMxMGM3MjllZjQ4ZDU4ZTlmYzExYjdiZWJjYzIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can count on us!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjEzODQ1ZjY4ZTQ1NjBhMjZjNjQ1ZjM5MTdhM2M1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kiku laughed, but before she could respond, a loud thud sounded from the front door. Then another, and then another. The room became deathly quiet. No one spoke, and everyone looked at Noburu. The knocking wasn’t one of their pre-arranged patterns.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGY1ODYyYzUyYTQwMDc4ODI2MjcwNzNhY2Y5NTdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll go talk to him,” he said with an exaggerated sigh. “Wait here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2Y5YTQ4Y2Q1OTRkN2NiMGVhMTVhYWM1ZDZmZGY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He left the room and headed down the hallway. The thudding in the doorway continued until Noburu pulled the iron bolt across, partially opening the door to reveal a familiar face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmM1OTIwZWRmNzRiMmFiOGIzNzI3NjUzZjY2YTI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yasuji,” Noburu intoned, moving to block the guard’s sight through the doorway. “What brings you here?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2JjYmViN2RlYTRiNjBiZWQ2MjMyMzQ2ODc5NjZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yasuji eyed him with yellow eyes, one hand on his hip and the other on his shortsword. Guards in the slums typically didn’t carry firearms, although Noburu had once seen a captain with a rifle. Still, the guards were the only ones who could carry weapons openly, and they made sure you knew it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGU3NGU2NGY1YTQ4N2I5ZGQyZjRmMWMwNDc2ZjI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saw the brats with a bit of copper. Buying food. Figured you gave it to them.” He clicked his fingers. “Come on, then. This month's late. Don’t give me any black speech about you not having it. I swear, little </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, I’ll turn this place upside down if I have to.” Yasuji spat on the floor, stepping up and putting a hand against the door, pushing it open. “Kiku in? Shall I give her my greetings?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMThmOTRkMjVjZjRkMjU5NTNjNGFmMDUxMDFiOWM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu extended a foot to prevent the door from opening any wider. Yasuji had encountered Kiku only a few times, typically on the rare occasions she felt strong enough to stroll to the market. Noburu disliked what he saw in the guard’s eyes during those moments. He also hated the sound of her name on Yasuji’s tongue.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODFkZGUzMGYyZjRhNzZiMGE2ZDk0ZTVmN2IyZGZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seeking to stop me doing my duty, little </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” Yasuji revealed an ugly grin. The guard gripped the handle of his sword tighter, unsheathing it an inch. “Want to play?” Yasuji asked, his brow furrowing. “Or should I use my </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">aura</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to tear this building down? Eh!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDk3ZTVhYzZhNzQ2Mjk5NmQ5YjEzYjA3ZGVmNTEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu desperately wished to smash the guard’s face. He doubted the man was a genuine warrior. If he truly possessed aura, wouldn’t he work as a manor guard, enjoying a more comfortable position? Or maybe he was indeed telling the truth, serving his role down here as a form of punishment.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTdiYWViMjA2MzQ5MjhiMGJlYWY1ZmQ4MmY0MWQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu forced an apologetic expression on his face. “Certainly not, Yasuji. Kiku is running a fever, and I’d hate for you to catch her ailment. Here,” he said, pulling a small coin purse from his pocket. He jingled it lightly to get the guards' attention, then poured its contents into his palm and gave it to Yasuji. “That’s it,” Noburu remarked, showing the empty purse. “You could tear up the floorboards and not find a single chit or tak. We barely have enough to survive the winter.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGYwMTI0OTcyNjQ4M2RhZmViOGU5ODUxNzUzZDcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The guard snorted. “Yeah, right. Little </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lords</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> like you always have more hidden away.” Noburu didn’t rise to the comment. On account of his and Kiku’s crimson eyes - redder than anyone else in the slums -Yasuji and the other guards had given him the nickname </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">little lord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was another thing that set Noburu apart from the rest of the slum dwellers. No matter how poor he presented or how destitute he really was, he would always be seen as having the taint of nobility in his bloodline.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzUzNDYzMzk5YjQ5OTA4NWUxYjg2NTgyNDJhYmQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that they were wrong.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzVlZGNmZTIzYzQzZDY4YjNkOWUyYzA5NGZlYWY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anything else?” Noburu asked, trying to glare just enough to let the guard know he wasn’t welcome, but not too much as to rile him further.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzgzNGQyOWViMTQwNzI4MjhjYTExN2UzNjUwNDRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be late next month. If it weren’t for us, those brats wouldn’t be able to beg or sell their wares. That’s a privilege that we could take away </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">at any time</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Then, you’ll need to find some </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">other </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">way to pay…” The guard's mouth curled up into a disgusting leer, his eyes looking past Noburu into the hallway beyond. Noburu had no illusions about what the man might demand if they couldn’t afford the protection fee.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTUxMTIxNDFiYTQ3YzJhM2E1Y2EyYjM3MzcxYWU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Over my dead body,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Noburu thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGI2YjAxNzMwMjQwNzNiZTdjODJhYzYxNzk4OWY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll make sure to have it ready,” Noburu intoned with a fake smile. “See you soon, Yasuji.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjAyMTY0OWVjYTRiODQ5OTFmNWI2MDkzNGFjYjI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He shut the door, letting out a sigh of relief. Lately, Yasuji had been making an increasing number of comments about Kiku. Fortunately, his sister seldom ventured outside and would remain indoors throughout the winter. He hoped the guard would find someone else to harass.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGZkOGNhZjk3MTRkMTI5NWVlMDJiYjQ1ODE5OWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu wasn’t a fighter. He could hold his own if necessary, but he doubted his odds against Yasuji, even if that man exaggerated his aura abilities. After receiving his hundred denarii from Yoshiro’s job, he would take stock of the situation again. If Yasuji hadn’t moved on by then, then Noburu would hire a cutthroat to deal with the issue once and for all.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzY1OWMzMmJkODQ5NzNhNGM5YTU1ZmQ4MWVmYWQ0" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">He would do anything to protect his sister, even if that meant stepping outside Asamaywa’s shadow and risking it all.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3MTg2NmY1MjcyYzQ5MDE5NjQ4NjVhMDcxMDY1ODEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDMxNDVhNzYwOTQ3MmI5YWMxOGFmZTBjYmJmMTgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">fter Amelia left Lunaria’s observatory, she dropped off the book about the Formless in her room before hunting down Serena for some aura training. Given Katalin’s morning session and the events that had transpired, most normal people would baulk at the idea of doing </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">more</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. However, Amelia’s magic made her an exception to the norm. Even with her body that was supernaturally more resilient due to her game stats, she was sure she would have fallen asleep if it weren't for her healing abilities; she needed a dash of it to repair her wound and recover from her exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTQwODgwYmUxMDQ2ODA5ODgyOGY2ZDZmYmZjZjE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> magic was miraculous, but it had its downsides. It prevented her muscles from fully benefitting from the intense training they’d been subjected to. The divine healing simply healed away the damage to the muscles instead of letting her body naturally strengthen the tissue through its normal processes. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjEyYTc5ZDE2ODRkNjZhMmIzY2I5MWYzNmI0YTFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finding Serena was easy; even if Amelia didn’t have her flow of aether that powered Serena’s wards to guide her, she only needed to take a moment to open her senses and Serena’s familiar aether signature was unmistakable. However, as Amelia strolled through the corridors this time, focusing intently on presenting herself as a refined lord-prospect and dignified assistant instructor, her mind wandered, and she forgot to pay attention to where she was going.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTgzZWFkMWQ0ZDQ3YTZiODE0YzZlOGE3OGUzYWM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite no longer consciously tracking down Serena’s signature nor following the aether trail, Amelia suddenly found herself before the demon. Was it luck, or was their connection so deep Amelia was unconsciously tracking her girlfriend?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODNkYmQ2NjRlMzQ1MjI5OGJhYjI5MWY1NGNiYjA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That didn’t make her a stalker, did it? It’s not stalking if you do it accidentally, right?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDU1MmFlNzdkZTQ1ZmY4ZTkwOTQyNGQ4YzViYjQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena stood in the academy’s main throughway, flanked by the rows of cabinets containing all manner of weapons, armour and other oddities laid gently on black cloth - a constant reminder to the students travelling between classes of the great warriors of the past.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWExMjY4MGJjYjQ3ZmE5YTEwZGQyZWE3YzUyZGMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Notably, there was no mage-related equipment on display. The magic tower possessed a few cabinets with examples of specific crystal cuts or old tomes documenting the history of formations, but nothing in the main building. From what Amelia could tell, the martial part of the academy revered their history with greater zeal than their counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGZlNjYxNzRmNzRjNzU5Y2U1NGRhMjA0MDc3YzI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Halen,” Amelia said cheerfully, coming up and standing next to Serena. Her girlfriend was looking at the names of student Speakers etched in brass. “Did you…” Serena was focused intently on the names. “...Want to practice our auras?” Amelia finished.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODgxYTlkYmMyOTQwMzRiNWJhMTIyMjY2Y2FjMmNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm,” Serena mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDk2NWNjMTVmNDRhYzhiNTg2NmJkOThjYWViZDE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Or, do you want to stare at a list of names all day? Can’t you think of something else you’d rather look at?” Amelia intoned, feeling her lips curl into a smile. She couldn’t flirt as boldly as she wished, especially with the chance of students and staff witnessing them, but some playful teasing seemed acceptable, didn't it? Amelia glanced around. How would Serena respond if Amelia gave her a swift smack on the behind when no one was observing?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGJlZDg4YWZmYTQ1YmQ4NDY2NTNkNzQ4Zjg5Y2Y0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No, she shouldn’t do that! It would be dreadful!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2UwOTRlODg5NzQwN2E5M2QwNWFmNzUyNzAwN2E3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If she did, Serena would make that adorable tutting sound and then try to stab Amelia affectionately, wouldn’t she? </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjhlYTViNTUzMzRlOTY5ZjQxMjZjMDY5ODQwMmJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe? Probably. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWRlYjExMTUyZDQxNDhhOGRlNjI4YzA2MTI0Y2Vl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Definitely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjI0NzVlZjhkMTQxY2I5NWFkZWUzY2Y4OTY5MmI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Must do it in the future,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia made a mental note. Making Serena flustered was Amelia’s addiction. After all, it wasn’t healthy for her big-softy girlfriend to constantly pretend to be a strict naval officer, was it? Years of war had caused Serena to put up all kinds of barriers, and Amelia was determined to break them all down!</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGVlMjgzNDdlNzQzNWFiOGNhNTljOWI0MmEwYTdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apologies, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Assistant Instructor</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thornheart,” Serena replied, giving Amelia the side-eye. “Just… memories,” she continued, returning to the list of names. “When I was a student, I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">desperately </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">wanted to be on this list. I was so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">determined</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. My yellow wasn’t quite there, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">still eluded me. It wasn’t until I spent a year as a squad commander that I managed to Speak for the first time.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTUxMjMyZDI2YTRhMWZhZjk1MGM5ZmFiNzZmYjY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think it helps?” Amelia asked. “To be in real combat?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzg2N2JhNTRmMDQxYTdhNmJkZjRiMTNjZWMwNjYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena nodded. “For me, it did. For others, it can hinder development. It varies by the individual and the will of the god with whom they are communing.” Serena’s brow furrowed slightly. “Gods like </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Bayle</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> place great importance on combat, while </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is more flexible. I first realised I was ready after…” Serena hesitated, looking around. “Well, it’s not a story to be spoken of in public. Ask me another time.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTBhYTg0MTlhMDQwMTQ5M2NkYzcxYTlhOGM5ZGRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia agreed. “Did you want to train aura?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjY5ZmUwNmZhNTQ1MWM4MWVmNzdkNmU5NGRkODNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yzg2MWEyZTExZDQ4Y2ZiYTM2NDI4ZGUyZThkMDE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena guided her to one of the instructor-only training rooms. Inside, Ryosuke and Nathaniel were training, and judging by how damp their uniforms were with sweat, they had been doing so for a long time. The pair nodded in greeting but otherwise continued to concentrate on their own training. The Asamaywa Academy had the best instructors, and those instructors found time in their busy schedules to ensure their skills did not lapse.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjM2M2M4MDg3ZjRmYzU5YzFkMzBmYzBmNDkwZjlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s the plan?” Amelia asked, as she was led to one of the corners.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjcwYjFmYjllZDQ4YTk5NWUyNmQ1ZTk1ZDYxNjli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though you achieved red through </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">combat</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, aura is refined through </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">meditation</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena explained, gesturing for Amelia to sit down. “Much like how we repeat strikes thousands of times, whether individually or through the formalised </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">katas</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, so that we can rely on them in a fight, we also train our aura through meditation, so that a base level of efficiency can be relied upon.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Yzk0MzgxOWU2ZDRmNGU4NjkyYWY2ZDdjNjNhZjJk" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are more active ways, of course: the aura-stepping exercise we did this morning, or the flaring practice during the warm-up. Don’t be mistaken,” Serena sat opposite Amelia, raising a finger. “Meditation is the foundation - the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sword and gun</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of a warrior’s abilities.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWQ3YWJmZTlkYjQyM2ViZGRjM2Q1MGQ5NzM2ZjE2" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM0Y2U3YTExNDkzMDRhNjZhNjZiMTNlYmU2MzA5MzRm" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDk0NGUyN2M5YTQ2ODY5MGYyYjQwOTZkMzE2NzJj" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wouldn’t an actual </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sword</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and an actual </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">gun</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> be the sword and gun of a warrior’s abilities?” Amelia asked innocently, tilting her head to the side. It was a strange saying, and she still preferred her world's version of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bread and butter</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. For some reason, Serena couldn’t wrap her head around it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDcwOGMxODI5MDRkZDQ5NmQ0YzY5ZTQwZmQ3OTA3" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNDk4MGM4YWU4MTQyZTFiNmI2MmQ2YjI5ZTc2MGEy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTgwYWYyZTNlNzQ0NzA4MWIzZGQ4YzViZmVjN2Ew" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shush,” Serena said, rolling her eyes and touching her lips. “Just listen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzJlY2YxOTcyYTQzMGNhMWJhMjAxNDEyMWQ3NGJk" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYWVjZDIzYzllNDQxMzc5MGZlMTA4NzAxYmJkYTc0" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTRkOGVmMzFlMTQ2YjQ5Mjk1NmNlMDBlMzc4MDgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTgxZDY4ZGZlNjRhNzQ4ZTY0NGViMTA4YTdiOWJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Try to enter red again. It’s much easier to form an aura the second time. If possible, try to restrict how much aether you convect. It’ll be distracting if you start glowing like the red moon again.” Serena’s mouth curled into a smile. “Now, close your eyes and begin. Spend a few minutes slowing your breathing, as we did in Kenhoro. When you’re ready, give it a go.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWQ1YjRkZjM5MDQ1MWM4MjY2MDVmMWYwYzJjZmI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2I0YzM0OWExZjRlMzg4ZTA0NGUwYTRhZDFkNDdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia closed her eyes, trying to quench her distracting excitement. With a few deep breaths, she began the breathing exercise. It was challenging at first; the more she tried to soothe her thoughts, the more her mind sought external stimuli. From the sound of Serena’s breathing to Ryosuke’s and Nathaniel’s grunts as they swung their swords, Amelia had to exert considerable effort to block them all from her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDJlZTk3ZDBmYzQyMjM4NzdlZmFhNTBlZTJlYTBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In time, she found some semblance of inner stability. Satisfied, Amelia began to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">convect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the aether around the body. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">convecting</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of a warrior's aether shared similarities but also differed from a mage’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">cycling</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. While the sensation once felt unnatural, now there was an element of familiarity. She embraced the sensation, concentrating on achieving a smooth and unified aether flow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTgxODJiMTdhYjRiOGViNmIxMGExY2ZjNGY2ZGVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, without warning, Amelia felt an exhilarating rush as her aether suddenly locked in and for the second time, a red aura blossomed throughout her body.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjM3ZDE0NjY2ZTQ5NzFiNTNkNWFhNDYyNTgxYTJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Power! Strength!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDBmNzdlMmJjNjRiOGI5MjQxODhhMjdmMzQ2Y2Q0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s tendons felt as if they’d become corded steel. Her skin was as impenetrable as thick ironwood bark. Her muscles became mighty lift engines, capable of lifting and throwing huge weights. She knew instinctively that she could sprint for hours, even without her healing abilities. This was aura!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDg1ZDljNTg5OTRhZWM4YTI5MTZhZjVlMzkyMmYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was different from her usual magic. Wards manifested as a thin layer, an artificial shield safeguarding the fragile body within. Even her strength-enhancing spells lacked the feeling of completeness that aura provided. Aura felt </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">natural,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as if it were an inherent extension of her body manifesting within her. It was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hers</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWE3M2RhNzlmMzQxOGQ4MGEyNjllOGEwOTkwMDI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well done,” came Serena’s voice. “But tone it down a bit; you’re brightening the whole room.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDU4Mjg2NDRhMDRmOTdiNmM3ZDY1YjNjNmJjZWJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia blinked her eyes open to a crimson-hued room. Although it was better than earlier that morning, it remained an embarrassing distraction for anyone else. Her focus started to slip, causing her aura to tremble. Sensing its impending collapse, she channelled more aether to stabilise it, deepening the room’s red shade. Oops! Ryosuke and Nathaniel paused their training, silently observing her with expressions of awe. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWQxODkyOTc4YjRhY2JhNDA2MTg5ZmY3YzM3Yzcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her attention inwards, lessening the quantity of aether feeding her aura. She succeeded, diminishing the aura’s radius to just a few feet. However, with such a minimal amount of her reserves sustaining it, her aura became unstable again. It flickered, and internally, it felt less evenly distributed than before.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWNhNzEyODYyNTQ3MDg5MjRhZjFmOGY2NWExOWI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t let it collapse,” Serena warned. “Close your eyes and focus. Your aether control is excellent, but you still need to get used to the warrior’s way. A musician might be able to skillfully play a tune quietly on one instrument but struggle on another. You must </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">refine</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDk0ZThmYzBiYjQ1Mjg5ZDdiY2Q0Yjg3YjJmODk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDBlMmZjOGJjOTQzMGQ5ZjgwMzgwODc2MGEwZmE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the analogy in mind, Amelia focused on stabilising her aura while keeping the total amount of aether fuelling it as low as possible. It was trickier than she thought; with the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">convecting</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> aether so minimal, her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">cycling</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> aether started to interfere. The aether sustaining her always-active wards greatly complicated the task. The task would probably be impossible if she didn’t have such instinctive control of aether.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGNiZDBjZjI3MDQ1OWZiMjFmZjNkNmNjMWIyZTJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was challenging, she gradually made progress. It felt akin to flexing a new muscle or learning a new sword technique. Initially, she felt overwhelmed by the numerous adjustments she needed to make to keep the two types of aether flows from interfering with each other. As her muscle memory - or rather - her aether memory improved, Amelia could focus on fine-tuning the more troublesome aspects while the core flow grew increasingly stable.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2VmNjU3YjBlMjQ4MTM4NDY1Y2FhNjFjNTVhODFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She engrossed herself in practice, focusing entirely on refining her aura while minimising her aether usage to sustain the convection aether flow. With each correction, the remaining issues became more subtle and therefore more difficult to iron out. It was an addictive process, like putting a puzzle together. First, you get the broad shape right; then, you tackle it bit by bit. She understood now why some warriors became obsessed with training!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTYyMTJiZTMyMzRhYjNhZGEzMDM5ZThhYTg4ZGQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When she felt ready, she opened her eyes and was surprised to find an audience. Alongside Serena, she was being observed not just by Ryosuke and Nathaniel, who had both changed into clean clothes, but also by Joey, Sarafina and several other instructors whose names Amelia didn’t know.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTdlZDhhMjNlMDRmMmU4OGY2Zjg5ZWE2N2U3ZGM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t realise I had an audience,” Amelia said, pleased to see her aura remained steady even as she talked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzE1MDllODVmZjQxZjJiNzMwN2Q0ZTViYjU0M2Rh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were in a deep state of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">flow</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena replied. “Word spread about the ‘human mage refining an incredible aura’. It’s been about three hours.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTlkNjlmMTMxNDQ2MGViZDk3MzdkZDYxNTUzZmNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Three hours!?” Amelia exclaimed. “It felt like… like only </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ten minutes</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!” She shook her head in disbelief. How could she be so wrapped up in her own activities that she lost track of so many people entering the room over such a long time? “Isn’t it risky to become so… absorbed in the flow?”</span></p><span class="cjg5MTYwOTQ4NzBkZDQxYWI4OGMwYmY3YzJkZDIyYjg3"><br/>Stolen from Royal Road, this story should be reported if encountered on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyZDVjMzgwMjYxZTQzYmNhNGE4YzlhY2IyMjJkN2Yx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course,” Serena said. “This is why many warriors train in secret, and if they do train with others, they ensure they have some guards…” She waved a hand over to the group of instructors, “...Protecting you. Not that you need protecting. Most warriors would struggle to crack your red, let alone your wards. Good job reducing the aether signature, though. It gets harder and harder to refine.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmIxNGJlNWMxNTRlMzA4NjVhNjk0Y2M1NzAxMGU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia glanced down at her body. She was softly glowing with red hues dancing across her skin, like light shining through clear water. Her aura spread out perhaps an inch. It wasn’t as subtle or refined as Serena’s red aura, but Amelia was more than satisfied with her progress. At the very least, she could use aura in training sessions and not be a terrible distraction!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzNkMDk1MDc0MDQzNDA5OTAzNGEyMGNkNmY1OTgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maintaining the underlying convection under small amounts of aether flow is only the beginning,” Ryosuke explained. “You’ll need to practice </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">increasing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it now while keeping it visibly unchanged. One of the greatest strengths of a warrior is how much aether they can pour into their aura while keeping their opponent from knowing its true strength. Cloaking spells help, but aura is best disguised by refining it further, making the convection </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">finer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Ryosuke looked to his left and right. “You’re here for this semester, right?” Seeing Amelia nod, he continued, “I think I can speak for everyone here, Assistant Instructor Thornheart, that we greatly anticipate what state your aura will be in at the end.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTQ4NjBhNmQ2YzQ2ZDI4YTlmYTU1Nzk4YjA4ZmY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This talented human might reach orange by then…” Sarafina added, throwing Amelia an appraising look. The rest of the instructors murmured their agreement before adding their own comments and gossip. Some of the younger instructor’s eyes possessed elements of envy, but thankfully, none of them reached the level of hostility.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDQzNDYwMDVkOTQzYzI4YWNhMjEyZDUxZDA4MmJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s Instructor Driss?” Amelia asked. What would Katalin say when she saw how refined Amelia’s aura had already become? Would she be impressed? When Amelia reacted to the demon’s taunts, exploding into red aura for the first time and slicing off her arm, Katalin responded as if the events weren’t anything unusual. Whatever standards the demon operated at, Amelia was eager to see if she could meet them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWZiNjE3NjIwNDQ1YWU4ODU1ZWVlMmVmOTUwNDc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I haven’t seen her since the morning session,” Ryosuke added. “She often trains alone in a private room. Sometimes, she vanishes completely for a few days. As a Highlord, I imagine she has a whole host of obligations that demand her time.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDdjYjcwNDhkNjQ2MzRhOGM2YWY3MDk0OTMyODQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And the Grandmaster?” Amelia asked. “Has he, uh, spoken to everyone else as well?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTg5Nzc0NmEyYTRhMTdhYmJlZjczZjkyYWYwYTU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He did,” Ryosuke responded awkwardly, rubbing the back of his head while glancing at the other instructors. “About the same stuff as you, I imagine,” he finished with a small shrug.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmYyODNjYjZlYzQwOTliMDUwNGNhMzM1YTQwYzlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded, saying no more. Not everyone in the room was in attendance for Katalin’s morning session, and the grandmaster had clearly dragged every witness to the event and given them an equally strong warning not to let the information get out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjI0YzNhOTRmYjQxNDM5MjNlMjM2NThhNzE5NjIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She cringed slightly as his words bubbled into her mind once again; a warning and plea not to cause any more chaos during her tenure here. Honestly, what kind of woman did he think she was! </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWYxYjVkY2QzMzQ1ZGE4OWM2M2U0OTc2YTQ3ZmRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, enough gawking,” Serena stepped in, waving a hand towards the group. She turned to Amelia and asked, “Did you want to keep going, or end it for today? It’s better to take breaks; let the mind digest the training while you sleep.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjhjYzY5ZWQ5YTQzYmI4NTNjMGRlMDcyODA1NmZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia sprang to her feet. “I’m done for today, I think. Thank you, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Instructor</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Halen. I might have some questions for you later…” Amelia finished with a deep bow. When she straightened up, there was the faintest tinge of redness on Serena’s cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmU2YTU5MzYzMzQyOWQ4ZjI4NGFhZTZlYzllMjJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just call me Serena when no students are around.” Serena breathed out slowly, her eyes not quite meeting Amelia’s. “We’ve known each other long enough. Come find me in the evening, then.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWVjMTFkMWJjYTQ3NThhYjUyZjA1MmI1ODYxYmM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Adorable!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDI1NmIxY2NhNjQ5ZTdiODY1ZTg0YmY5MGM2NmFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, sure!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGViMTQ1ZGQ4MDQzYjI4MWQ1OTk2ZWYyMWIwN2Yz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Amelia thanked the other instructors for their comments and exited the training hall. Neither her nor Serena had any illusions about what kind of ‘evening questions’ they’d have for each other.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWI3MDAyMTUzMjQ0YTBhZjZmYzU0ZTc5OTAwNGVh" style="margin-bottom: 2em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, her girlfriend was such a softy!<br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDQ2M2RlZTIxYzRjN2NhZGYzZDhlNzkxZGM0MmQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><img alt="New Scene - Mel POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/mel.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM4MTkwMzU1NmY3ODQ3ZmQ5MDQ0ZTcyMzI2YTYxMWIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With Mel’s classes finished for the day, she planned to spend a quiet night in her quarters refining her aura. On the way back, she was interrupted by the appearance of a staff member carrying a small bag. By the sound it made when moved, it contained paper.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTRiMDJkMDYwNzRkMzBiMGQzMGFkZTYzZTAwMjZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re Assistant Instructor Thornheart’s assistant?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTVmM2YzZWI5YjQyY2NiMDNmMTE3OTJiNzdmYjE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Mel said.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzNlZjlkMWU5OTRlZTVhMGM0NzZiNGExNjBjYjli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, take these then. They’ve all come for her in the last two days.” The demon thrust the bag towards Mel. With a feeling of puzzlement, she took the bag and looked inside to see it contained twenty or thirty letters. Judging by the fine paper and wax seals, many were from wealthy families.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTJhNzYwNDVmODRmODBiMmY0N2UzMWUyZTIwMmJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not exactly sure why she’s so popular,” the staff member mumbled. “Perhaps everyone wants to invite the new human noble for a meal. Either way, my workload in the mailroom has doubled since she arrived. We’ve even had to put another guard at the front gate to turn people around.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGRjYzZjYTJhYzRmMWQ5YjdiNjZjNzk1NDg5N2U4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll let her know,” Mel said. Having been on the receiving end of Amelia’s healing spell, Mel had no illusion regarding why Amelia was receiving so many letters. Every family in the East with an ill family member who had heard the rumours would be trying to make contact. Did Amelia fully understand how much chaos the very </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">idea</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of her was bringing to demon society?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjEzNWEzNTQyNDQwYTU4YTUzMmNkOTgyMjI4ZDdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a small sigh, Mel returned to the upper floors of the magic tower. Instead of going straight to her quarters, she stopped before Amelia’s door. Before she could even knock, a cheerful “Come in!” sounded from inside. Mel opened the door, stepping in and closing the door behind her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWE4YTk4ZjIyMzQwOTA5NDAxNjgxZGVlMzg5NmRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assistant, ahem-” Mel coughed quietly. “Amelia?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDM0NTczNmQxOTQ0MGU4OGE4YjRjNzgxMmQ1Mjlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In here,” came the reply.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDhkYWU0ZjQ5YTQwZWI5NTA3MmZjYjNmMTI2OWRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel followed the voice into the bedroom, where Amelia lay relaxed on the bed, reading a book. Even though Mel’s rooms were better than her shared accommodation in the Kenhoro Officer’s Academy, she still felt a little envious of Amelia’s double bed and finely carved furniture. Apparently, the magic tower spared no expense in setting up the infamous human healer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTA3OGIzOTE4YTRkZWFiZmJiMDBjYjQ1MDE0YjQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that Mel disagreed with the favouritism. Amelia was a friendly human healer on a continent of demons without gods of healing. What did that make her? A demigod? Mel shook her head the moment the thought formed. There was only one figure that deserved that title, and she resided in the Cathedral of Bone thousands of klicks away. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTg1MjBlNWI1YzRiM2E5MDk2N2Y5MTEyYmJiZTA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you reading?” Mel asked, trying to turn her thoughts away from blasphemy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDk4OTQyOGEyMDRkYzc5ZWQwY2QyYThjNjJhZjdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A book on the Formless,” Amelia replied. “Did you know that…” she intoned as she traced the page with a finger, “...That there’s a Formless called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Osoric</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that goes around teaching blacksmiths how to make better weapons? He’s very active in Centralis, seen several times a year!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzJhZDA1MGYwMzQ4MmJiZGJhZTQwMjY3NzM2MTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The name rings a bell,” Mel said. Growing up in Kenhoro she was taught the Formless were powerful Kami that would come after her if she didn’t eat everything on her plate or do her chores. Admittedly, she hadn’t given them much thought as an adult. She told Amelia as much and then passed her the bag of letters, saying, “These have all come for you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzRhMTQwNGJiOTRiNGNiMGQ2MmJjODFiNThkYTYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooh! Letters!” Amelia excitedly opened the bag, pouring the contents onto the bed. Many of the letters were decorated with metallic thread, some even embossed with moon crystals. They were all written to “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect Amelia Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Amelia waved Mel to sit on the bed, which she did after some hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTI1YWRhYThhNTQ4ZGY4YzEwZTg4ZDNhMjYzNDM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a comfy mattress,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Mel thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTM4N2M1N2Y1ZTRkM2U5ZTZjODkwMWQxNDA4NzI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was about to ask if Amelia wanted her to fetch a letter opener, but the human seemed more than happy to use her hands to open them. Moments like this made Mel ponder the mystery of Amelia Thornheart. The woman spoke High Imperial with a refined accent as good as any other noblewoman, and her curtsying and general movements carried an inspiring gracefulness. Yet, her other actions were often unladylike: requesting Mel to call her by her first name after only knowing her briefly, asking someone who wasn’t a family member to sit on her bed, and eagerly using her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hands</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to open important letters.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTcwOTIzYmI4ZDQzODQ4N2MxNDBhYTM1NmRkMmE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s movements and language were at a standard that only noblewomen achieved through training since birth. Who would raise her in such a way but fail to instil the other components of nobility in her? With what little digging Mel had attempted, Amelia hadn’t given much up. The woman would just shrug and say her past was complicated. She didn’t want to risk offending her, so she’d given up on prodding at Amelia’s background. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWRmYzMyMTVmNDRiM2Y5ZDJmZjBhMzFlMzY2ZjE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, she was sure she would find out someday. All secrets claw their way to the top eventually.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzZmMjRlNWZlNzRiZDViMjU0NTMyZmU2YmZhNjc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah,” Amelia mumbled, her face falling. “Another one of these…” She sighed, placing the letter to one side before opening another. Upon reading it, Amelia put it in the same pile with a tense expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGYyZDdkOWI4ZTQ2OTc5NmViMWEyZGRjMDRiZTcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?” Mel asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2ZhNzU2NzUwZjQyYzE4MTZmNWEwYTVlNTg0NmVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sad stories,” Amelia answered, glancing at the opened letters. “Sons with missing limbs. Daughters with incurable illness. Offering me large amounts of money to travel to heal their family members or even willing to bring the patient to me. At least some letters are more positive, like this one!” Amelia held up a letter sewed with gold thread. “An invitation to a fancy meal and dance in Hokanai! I won’t be able to go, but it's nice to be invited!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTYwNmRhZTRhMjRjNzg5MjY3M2EzY2RlYmQ0OTNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“These days, I imagine you’re at the forefront of many dinnertime conversations,” Mel pointed out. She didn’t want to add that the invitations to highborn events were likely just the more tactful approaches to petition Amelia for her healing services. “Do you plan to accept any of them?” she asked, gesturing to the growing pile of requests. Mel was surprised to see Amelia shake her head and asked why.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTg2NGQ3YmE1YzQ5MDA5NDYwMmJhOWZiOWU4YzI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lords, Highlords, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Greatlords have told me that if I start healing everyone, it’s going to cause chaos and political conflict between the Terra Firmas, and that could spiral out of control,” Amelia explained with a pained expression. “I don’t like it, but it does make sense. If I favour healing the warriors and mages of a particular Greatlord or some other group, I could upset any power balances.” Amelia threw her hands up. “It’s so frustrating! You would think having power and my abilities meant you could do anything you wanted, but I’m actually under more restraints than someone with no abilities! Ah…” Her shoulders slumped. “Maybe I’ll run away and farm somewhere in peace…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Nzk5N2U0ZDEzMjQ3OTc5NmUwOTEwNjI2OTg0OGUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel giggled. “Sorry,” she said. “It’s just I can’t imagine someone like you… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">farming</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. But I suppose I understand what you mean. I’ve heard the movements of the Greatlords and other Second-Word Speakers are heavily restricted by the Overlords due to them being strategic weapons. Imagine how much worse it would be if you could Speak a Second-Word!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjkxM2MxZThmZjRhMGZhYjAwZDY5YmViMTlkY2Vj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Students here and back in Kenhoro frequently discussed the topic of Second-Word Speakers. It was well known that the Greatlords, who had reached the near-pinnacle of divine favour by communing at least one Second-Word, were second in power only to their overlords and the demigod above even them. But what about the hidden Speakers? The ones that were fully dedicated to their overlord’s will, living quiet lives in strategic locations, ready to act at a moment's notice? According to her fellow students, the top contenders of people in the academy who were secretly Second-Word Speakers were the Head of the Department of Leadership and Ethics, Ryosuke Yamamoto, and the famous Northern swordmaster, Katalin of Driss.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWRmNGMzMzJiMjQ5MjliMTdlMDZhMjQ0OGI3ZTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Amelia had amazing abilities and was freakishly strong in her own right, but how would she react if she went against a Second-Word Speaker with their mighty embodiments of their communed god? </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDg3NGUwMTg3NDQwZTQ5M2ZhMzNiNmFhNjIyODBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Imagine…” Amelia huffed. “Help me organise these, will you? Can you write down a list of everyone asking for my help? Even if I can’t help them right now, I’ll remember it for later.” Amelia reached over, pulling a notebook and pen from the bedside table.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGEzYjM5MTBiZDRhNWQ5NTZlNDJiNTBmY2FkOTBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure it’s okay?” Mel asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmVlYWEzNTgxYTQwOTM5NzZiMmE2NTg3NjAxMzJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGZjYmY2MDY5MjQyZmE4MDBhYzliYTY1NTBiOWQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For me to know… that information.” It felt wrong for someone like Mel to have access to such personal letters. Many noble families didn’t speak publicly about family members who were struck with ailments. Instead, the families kept up the act of them ‘travelling’ or ‘spending time in seclusion’ until they recovered. Often, you wouldn’t know they had been ill until the family announced the death and subsequent period of mourning.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWZmOTE0YTEwNjRhYjhiOThlYmU3MGUzNDU0OTNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about it,” Amelia waved a hand dismissively. “Just don’t tell anyone else, alright? Oh, if any letters are from House Halen then put them to the side. Also…” Amelia lifted one of the letters up, tapping the wax seal. “If you see any seals that look like they would suit me, let me know. I’m technically the Head of House Thornheart, and I need to create my own insignia. If you have any ideas, let me know!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjlhM2NhMjJkZDRjNzhhYWRjM2UzMzViOTk3YTk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">One huge question mark would be appropriate,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Mel thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmYwZTgzMDhiNDQ1YWQ4M2RjOTBiNTg2ZWRhMmQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll keep an eye out,” Mel said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzZmOWM1YTlmNzRhMGNiMjVlNzYyNTgwYzAwNGNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two set about tabulating and organising the letters. As time passed, Mel found herself telling Amelia about her life. Even though Amelia was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she was surprisingly easy to talk to. With nobility, you always had to watch your conduct, for they could fine you on a whim. Speakers like Amelia even possessed the right to detain suspected criminals. Such concern didn’t exist with Amelia, and Mel felt comfortable talking about her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjdmMmJhYzAwZTQ5ZTFhNGYxMGQxZDE4MDc2YWMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve been thinking recently; I want to become more than just an Officer,” Mel explained as she scribbled on the paper. “Above all else, I want to become exceptional with the sword, as good as Captain Halen or Highlord Driss. To that end, I was thinking I would spend a few years as a squad commander, then return to the academy as an Assistant Instructor. Then, I can focus on communing a Word and as a result, be tenured as a full Instructor!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWRhM2E4MjZjOTQ5NjY5NTg1YWE2OGYxODkwMTI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I haven’t forgotten my promise. I’ll put in a good word for you!” Amelia said, giving Mel a double thumbs-up that made her giggle. The grandfather clock chimed, and Amelia sat up quickly. “Oops! I’m late to an, uh, appointment. Let’s finish up for today!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGEwNTVmODQ3MzQ2ZjY4OTVlZDk0NjkyN2Y1ZjA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.” Mel nodded. “Did you want me to bring you anything to eat later?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmQ1MjY1YWMwYjQ1MWZhYzhiNGE3YzEwNmQzMDFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thank you,” Amelia began brushing her hair. “I won’t be back tonight, so don’t stay up.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmYyNWM1NmNlNTQ5M2I5NTc5MDZjZThkZTM1ZjFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You won’t be back?” Mel tilted her head in confusion. “Where are you going?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjZjNjAxYTM5MzRlNGZhZGFkZjQ4YzRiYWY4ZDc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-nowhere!” Amelia spluttered. “I mean, I’m going to do some training, and if it gets too late, I’ll just stay in the main building. Just don’t…” She waved her hairbrush in Mel’s direction. “...Don’t wait for me or anything. Focus on your own training!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjVmNmM3M2FkYzQ3MGI4YTIxYjYxOWU1ZjkwMmQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Could she be meeting a man?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Mel thought. She’d only ever heard tales of human-demon relationships. The human church strongly forbade them since all offspring from such a pairing were always full-blooded demons, regardless of the race of the mother. No one could say that Amelia wasn’t beautiful, at least for a human. Mel found it a bit jarring to see a face without </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">some</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> horns attached. The tops of human heads always seemed weirdly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">flat </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">open </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">in comparison. Still, Mel could understand why some demons would find Amelia pleasing to look at.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWZiYzBiYjRhYTQ4OWNiMjcwYWRmMDZmZWI0N2Zm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she’ll tell me who it is, eventually</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWJkOWE1ZTU2ODQyMGI5ZWM0ZTk5MDMwNmQwZjNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia finished up and headed out, leaving Mel to tidy the room. She arranged the letters on the desk, leaving the unopened ones for Amelia’s return tomorrow. She made the bed and quickly brushed down any surfaces that looked dusty. She opened the top window a fraction to air the room and ensured the remaining windows were locked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjFhYzAyODgzYzQzMjdhMDUxOTQ5NTVhYmMxYTIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjVjMjQzZTc5NDRiNjlhZWIxZjdhMDQyNmQ4NDY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Down on the grounds, Mel thought she saw someone in the shadow of a large tree, obscured by its trunk. It looked like they were watching her for a moment, but when she blinked, the figure was gone. Some staff members were walking a path behind the tree, and they gave no indication that someone was hiding from Mel’s sight. Was it a trick of the light?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDYxNTIwMGEwYzQ3ZjhhY2RiMjU2M2JjMDRkZmNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Putting it out of her mind, Mel retired to her own quarters for the night. Inspired by the enthusiastic human who seemed to have boundless energy, Mel relaxed into a meditation position and began refining her aura. Her red was now heavily hued with orange, and she felt like she would break through to the next level of aura any week now.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjU4ZGNhOTMzZDRkODc5ZTMwODEzNjc2ZWE2M2Uy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if Amelia managed to reach red </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">eventually</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Mel would surely be able to impress her with an orange aura! The next time they duelled, Mel would show Amelia how far she had to go!</span></p>

<p class="cnM4OTY3MDQ4YTlmZTRiZDZiMTNmYjQ1ODkxMDM1Yjc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmJjZTEyMWIwNTQ2MTFhYzc5NThmN2Q3N2EwMTk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena woke to a comforting warmth divided into two parts: the first being the golden-haired Amelia nestled in her arms, snuggling against her chest; the second was the radiant glow of Amelia’s magic enveloping Serena, soothing her muscle soreness and dispelling any lingering sleepiness.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzY5ZjE3NDU2ZDRkNTY4NTFkMTJiMWJkZDcwNjBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d experienced the sensation of going from asleep to fully awake in a split second before. Serena had been shelled awake on more than one occasion, and Anathor had done his fair share of acting as an alarm while she’d been asleep in her hammock. What she would never get used to was the magic-induced wakefulness that was on par with adrenaline.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWQ3Yzc3NTg5NTQ1NDA4ZjYzZTUwZGJmMTkwMTI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I presume you’re awake?” Serena intoned, bending down and ruffling Amelia’s hair.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTMwNmZlNjc4YjRiZTc5ZjY2ZDMyZGNiOWMzOTRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven hells, Amelia smelt good. Her mother once told Serena that the man she’d marry would smell alluring. She didn’t quite understand it until recently. Of course, her mother would never have thought it would be another woman who would be so welcoming to her daughter's nose.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjNmM2FiMzhhYzRhYWZhYjE4MGU5MmRjZDE0OTI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait… marriage?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTU0NWU3ZjJiMDQwZWM4ZTQ2MDVjOGNmNGYxNDBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The clock chimed,” Amelia mumbled. “You were sleeping like a baby. Mmm… oh, wait!” Amelia shot up, her forehead furrowing. “I didn’t just ruin your training from Katalin’s session, did I?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTBlMDZmNWM3YTRmNGQ5OTQ4MTNhNWVkMTBmZjdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Serena said, stretching her limbs before pulling Amelia back into a cuddle. “Muscles only grow for about twenty hours after being stressed, so it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2Y2YjE5ZThhYzQ5OTdiZjA3MDMyMzZjOGM4MTdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Twenty hours? Are you sure? I thought it was longer…” Amelia said softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzIzM2I2NWRiYTRhMDdhMzZjNTcyNDhhNWVlODE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe for you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">weak </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">humans,” Serena gave Amelia a sly smile, reaching down and flicking her nose. “Demons heal faster, grow faster, get ill less often…” Serena trailed off, lightly rubbing Amelia’s shoulder. “It’s only fair,” she continued. “We don’t have any gods of healing, so at least it’s somewhat balanced by our constitution.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGM0ZTc2MmRkNTRiOWFiM2U3Y2YyZmQ1NTFiYTcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> can be your god of healing, can’t I?” Amelia said with pride, gesturing towards herself with a thumb and sticking her tongue out playfully.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjY0ZjU1NThmZDRhNzdhMzY5NzNjYzZjOGQ0NmYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You…” Serena frowned before relaxing when she saw that Amelia was joking. Thank the Empress for that! If Amelia went around proclaiming herself a god, then the world would be thrown into total chaos.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzQ0ZTE0YTViOTQxNjQ5MmYzMzE5NzkyNWM3NjZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even more than it already was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjhiYmM5ZDZjYjQ1OWU4Y2RhZjEyNzljOGVhODlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Coffee?” Amelia asked, cheerfully changing the subject.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGQ1NTgyZTg1YTRkM2U4ZDk4NDM3MmNkNWJkNzRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm,” Serena climbed out of bed and prepared them some morning coffee. They both cleaned up and dressed, only this time, Serena changed into her officer’s uniform. “Going to check in on the ship,” she explained when Amelia raised an eyebrow. “Would you mind giving it a quick clean?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGQxNTNhZDkxZTQ4ZDk4MDYyZTlkNTM4MjZiN2Ji" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a dash of Amelia’s cleaning magic, the uniform was free of dust and dirt. Amelia’s cleaning even removed the small smears of lubricant and grease that Serena picked up whenever she checked in on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> engineers. It was a great utility spell, and if she were ever away from Amelia for a long time she didn’t think she would get used to not having the feeling of total cleanliness that her magic invoked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmUzZTQ4Njk1MTRmYTQ5YzhmNWEyMThmYzA2NzUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m becoming spoilt,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Like Lani</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTVmNDY1MGNhZDQwZDE4M2Q5MzEzNWE5OWI0YWYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You want to come?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzQ4ZGI3Y2YyNzRlZTBhNDI4ZDYzYjUxYWI2ZTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Another time!” Amelia responded. “Lunaria gave me a book on the Formless. I plan to read through it and then chat with Anathor. Think he’ll mind?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzRmZWE2MzViZDQ4NzViNzFlYzAzOGI0OWFiNWZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, but don’t get your hopes up,” Serena answered. She’d first been apprehensive regarding the grumbling Formless, but as the moons came and went and Anathor had been nothing but trustworthy, she’d found herself relying on him. The few times she’d been a little inquisitive regarding </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">who </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">what </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">he was, she hadn’t gotten very far. “Anathor’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">old</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I’m not sure how old he is, but his memory isn’t great. He once mentioned something about it being </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">damaged</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Although…” Serena’s mind suddenly connected some dots. If Amelia’s healing magic was strong enough to seep into the fourth deck, was there a possibility that she had somehow </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">healed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Anathor? </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTFmYTI5OTExNjQyODk4MjFmNjgwNWZiOWI0MzRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia clearly followed the same line of thought, asking, “Do you think he’ll let me try and heal him?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzY0ZTM2ZGU2OTQyYzE4NDVkYjRmNTc0NGMyNWU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You could ask, but don’t do it without my permission,” Serena warned. “I’m not confident that it wouldn’t have unintended consequences. Anathor isn’t a living being - not by our normal standards, anyway. He’s a… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. He doesn’t have a physical brain to store and process memories like we do. No one knows how the Formless work.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzI4Yzk2OGJiYzQ0ZDA4NzJmM2I3YzVjMTMzOTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded. “And what about you? Have you had any more of those weird dreams? You know, mysterious bearded captains talking about ominous temples?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmI1NjllOGIxOTQ3MGY4NDI3Mzk5MzEzZDljNDgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, but I have an odd feeling that they'll resume if you use any large-scale magic on the ship again.” Serena didn’t know if having more interactions with the ship would be a good thing or not. On one horn, it could provide some of the vital information that Chesterfield was obviously withholding, but on the other horn, she could handle only so much at once. Having weird dreams that may or may not be the memories of a splintered </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> contained within the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> hull was not exceptionally high on her list of priorities.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWQ5MzU4ODc2NzRhZjY5MGM3Y2FiNTJkZjg1ODEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a kiss goodbye, which quickly became a second and third kiss, Amelia snuck out. After waiting a few minutes, Serena left with a slightly flushed face. She left the main building, heading down the main path where early morning work crews were still installing steam pipes. She passed a yawning gate guard and entered the streets of the slowly waking Asamaywa.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWRiOGYwZjgzOTRlYTNhZTdiZGNhMTk1NjIyNTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A city was like a living being. In the mornings, it slowly became awake, with street cleaners brushing the paths and clearing snow, followed by the countless shop owners getting ready to open for business. Steam erupted from wall vents, indicating the early morning kitchen work of many of the city's restaurants. Younglings, with their horns small and still growing, ran through the streets throwing or posting the morning broadsheets. As the foot traffic increased, the food stalls began selling morning snacks to the workers heading towards their shifts.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDliNTY4NWYwZjQ2M2E5YjU5NzU5NzBiZTYxMDgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hopping onto a passing tram, Serena rode to the Asamaywa Imperial Docks. Stepping off, she handed her identification to the soldiers guarding the entranceway, and after receiving a quick salute, she went inside. Almost instantly, the noise of steam grinders and welders filled her ears, along with the demanding shouts of foremen and workers. Whether it was day or night, dockwork never ended. Maintenance was always needed, or some cargo needed to be moved.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTg2ZjVhNTRmNzRkYWZhZjc1NmE3Mzk5OTRjMzk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking to the bay that held the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">easily identified by its distinctive black hull, Serena was about to step onto the gangway when she was hailed from behind. It was Thorne, her weapons officer. He ran up to her, offered a salute and said, “Captain! Morning. Was about to send an aethergram to the Academy.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDA3ZWQ4NjBjYzRlYzI5Mjc5YTgxZjA1ZDZmZDA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What news?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTBkYzRhMTNlNjQxNDFiZTQ5MDI3YTM3M2FiNTQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Someone from Intelligence has some orders from up above. He’s waiting back there,” Thorne indicated towards a door behind him. “Brought some fancy-looking equipment with him, as well as some engineers. Wouldn’t tell me what it’s about, but if I had to guess, we’re getting some upgrades.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWRmMjQzZjhhMjQ4Y2VhY2YxNWQyZDM2NTUyNGEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Equipment? Be specific, Officer?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2Y1MmNjNTFmYzQ4MGZiNWVkZTg5NjZhMzNjYzdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye, Captain. Looks like a new fire-control system for our cannons. A mechanical calculator that links up with the range-finder.” He shook his head slightly, an expression of awe and excitement forming on his face. “I saw early prototypes of it when I was in training, but this looks far more sophisticated than anything I could have envisioned. Looks like the very latest stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWNjM2RkNDc0ZDQwMmJhNWY1OTkyMmFmNGE2ZmMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t often she saw excitement on the face of her weapons officer. The man had once told her he cared about one thing and one thing only: to accurately put down as much shellfire as possible on an enemy's location, whether in the sky or on the ground. Serena valued that kind of ruthless pragmatism the most and put significant effort into cultivating it amongst her officer staff. They fulfilled their roles with efficient professionalism, so if someone like Thorne dropped that facade, this new fire-control system was the real deal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTM4NGM3ZmE3YTQ0OThiN2ZiZjAyOGZhN2RmZjM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And this Intelligence Officer, did he give his name?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzcwN2Y2MjFlYTQ1NzViZGIzM2Q4YzYwY2VlNWFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Introduced himself as Officer Adachi, Captain. Said you were expecting him at some point.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTFlNjFiOWUwNzRlNzk4MTFmZDAwNTQ0Y2U3OGYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Perfect.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDk4NjY1OWFmNDRjYTM4ZDBmMTBmYjJjMmRkNGI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take me to him,” she instructed Thorne. The man saluted and led Serena through the door he’d gestured at earlier into a small waiting room. There stood the familiar visage of Aiden Adachi in uniform and three middle-aged engineers in overalls. There was nothing special about the overalls themselves, but from the visible cuffs, boots, and necklines Serena could see all of these engineers were officers.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTI1NDk1ZGU5OTQxZTZhMDFiYzhkMjM5YjMzYTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Halen!” Aiden called out, walking up to her and offering a salute. “Congratulations on making Lord. Long overdue, if you don’t mind me saying.” He held out his hand, his face showing a wide smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGQ5YzBjZGM0ODQzZTA5YmQwYWZhMDBmM2NkNzE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena took his hand in her own, shaking it. Maybe she used too much force, or perhaps there was a look in her eyes that Aiden picked up on, but his smile suddenly didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Nothing to mind,” she said with her own slick smile. “I thought the same.” She held his gaze for a little longer than most would consider appropriate before turning and nodding towards the three engineers. “And who are these men?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2VlNDBmMGNlZjQxMWJiYTI2YWRiNjRiODBmN2Nk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain!” The one in the center saluted. He possessed a thick Centralis accent. He didn’t sound highborn. Serena immediately recognised him as someone who had risen through the ranks. “Sergeant Major Lange, Engineer Corps!” He exclaimed, introducing himself. “These two are Warrant Officers Watanabe and Satou.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2RmYjk3ZmEzNTRiNTM4MGU5YWE2Zjc2ODQ5NTM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain!” The two Warrant Officers saluted, their accent matching Serena’s own.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWUxYzRmYTNmODQ4NmU5Y2I1NjQwZDI3ZmYzMGEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“At ease,” Serena intoned, approaching the Sergeant Major. “Where are you from, Sergeant Major?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWFiYzYzNjlmNzRhYzNhYTEzMmFjNTI3NjEwZjM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kronach, Captain!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjA1ZjExMWE4NDRiZmI5MTFkOThlMTUwMTU0YWY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Near the capital, then. What’s a Centralis-born man like you doing over here?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzMyYmYyMTI4NzQxOTU4NDE1NjUzZDRkY2MyNmJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Priority assignment, Captain! We’re here to modernise your fire-control system and train your gunnery crews on its operation! We also have orders to shore up your defences. A shipment of rolled homogenous armour should arrive any day now!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmQyYzlhMWQ0ZjRkM2RhZDRmYWIxM2U1OTUwZDU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you now…” Serena narrowed her eyes, prompting the Warrant Officers to swallow audibly. She considered herself a military soldier through and through, but the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> always operated slightly outside the typical chain of command, with her captain's position possessing more autonomy than usual. Serena was accustomed to making her own decisions regarding provisioning upgrades for the ship, as she did with the new propellers Tomes recommended. Having a stranger appear and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">tell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her what work had to be done irked her a little.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2I1MjQ1NzgyNjQxZGNhYjRmOTA3NDg0NWZkMzcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Halen,” Aiden said quietly. “Orders from up high.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWNmZmFmMjg0ZDRiOWNhOWJlNGIwMzhjZGU2NjU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena turned to see Aiden extending a sealed plain-looking letter. She took it from him, stepped aside. With a glance at the wax seal, verifying the letter originated from Centralis Intelligence, Serena tore it open. She read the contents twice before tutting and crushing the paper in her hands. What pair of horns did Intelligence think they had to refer to her ship as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lacking an adequate fire-control system</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? She did agree with the orders to conduct training drills alongside the academy’s semester, but Serena planned to do that anyway!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWIwZWEzY2E1ZjQ0MTFiMDhkMzc0NGRhZTA0OGJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was micromanagement. The exact type of superior she hated most.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Mzc2YWI2MjhiZTQ2MTA5YzEzNmM5NzFmYjBmOWVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Always sticking their noses in…” Serena grumbled. She clicked her tongue, not hiding her annoyance. “Right then. Sergeant Major Lange, what new fire-control system has got my Weapons Officer so riled up?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDIxYTBkOTRhYTQ3YWViNGM3NzEwY2QwZDkzMTBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain!” Lange gestured towards a door. “We have it partially assembled in here. If you’d follow me…” Serena nodded and was led towards the adjoining room.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjgzMWU1YWU2NjQ1NjM4MzEzOWU1OGY5YTQ2YWZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll be off then,” Aiden called out, turning towards the exit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2NlNjA3YmUxNzRiMWViYTA1NjQ4MDExNjVkMWJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hang on,” Serena coldly intoned. “I have questions that need to be answered, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Officer Adachi</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Kindly wait here.” She glared at Aiden until the man’s shoulders slumped, and he nodded meekly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2UxN2MwMTgzNDQ3MzNiZTljY2RjMTJjNGZhODc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving the man to simmer in his nervousness, she and Thorne followed the three engineering officers into the next room. An area had been cleared out and swept clean. On one side, a large cross-shaped piece of equipment lay. She immediately recognised it as a type of naval rangefinder; each of the three turret pods on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> used a long-base coincidence naval rangefinder to determine the distance of a target. With that information, along with the sighting telescopes on the top and bottom of the ship's superstructure that determined the azimuth and elevation, the gunners only needed to estimate the target's speed to fire shells somewhat accurately.</span></p><span class="cjRlOGUwOTcxMDc4MjQ5OGZhMjIwZDhiMjM2ZjNiNTcy"><br/>Support the creativity of authors by visiting the original site for this novel and more.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmZmIzYWIxYjQ0NDRhMGRiODM3OGU5NWJiODNhNzgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The difference was that this range-finder was cross-shaped and had a series of flanges along one side, where there would presumably be pipe connections once it was fitted. More piping could be seen snaking its away over the cross-shaped equipment. Why would a rangefinder need steam? Confused, Serena turned her attention to the main attraction: A large metal and glass box sitting in the center of the room. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjM1ZTgxNWQwMzQ5MTI4MjUzZThlMDYwMzFmNjli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It stood hip height and was perhaps two meters by one meter. It could be mistaken at first glance for a fancy desk if it weren’t for the tempered glass windows revealing the fine cogwork inside. On the outside, there were a dozen labelled levers, dials, switches and flipdot readouts. On the parts not covered in controls, there were tables of values etched into the metal. Like the strange rangefinder, this table had flanges where steam pipes could be attached. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDdhY2Q4OTdjMzRmOTNhNTBlMDlhNTE4Yjk0N2Rh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of steam, a shiny new steam engine and other miscellaneous equipment lay next to the table. Even with a glance, Serena could tell this steam machine was modern, looking far </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sleeker</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and more </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">machined</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> than the massive cross-compound double expansion engine that supplied the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmZiZDBkNTk3NDQ5NDJiNTljNzUwNzZmMWViNzgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Officer Halen, may I introduce you to the</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Integrated Ambler Firing Table</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Lange explained, dramatically gesturing with his hand. He pointed at the cross-shaped range-finder. “Starting with this. It is a six-meter, dual-sighting, gyro-stabilized theodolite. The operator lines up the target using the same method as the usual coincidence range-finders, but in addition to the target’s range, it also calculates their azimuth and elevation. This information is automatically fed via steam pressure through these outlets…” He pointed towards the flanges Serena had spotted before turning and identifying the same on the firing table. “...Into the firing table here. Do you see this fourth and fifth connection? If we connect it up to the ship tachometer and pitot-venturi tubes, then </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” he slapped the part of the table that contained the densest amount of machinery, “Does all the maths for you. If you feed it enough steam or manually crank this handle, it’ll constantly output targeting data to the flipdot displays. We call it the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">director</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWE0ZDU0M2FiNDQ2ZmJiMzJiNTZmMmViZTdhMTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not only that but through these switches, you can tell the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">director</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to factor in how many pounds of propulsion-crystal you’ve got in the barrel. I’m told you still use manual traverses to adjust the gun's elevation and rotation, yes? Well, here’s the bit that’ll blow your mind, Captain.” The growing enthusiasm of the Sergeant Major reminded Serena of how Allston sometimes got when talking about engine rebuilds. Her attention was directed to the steam engine to the side. “This is the latest generation gun-mover, the result of a collaboration between Centralis and Yemenian engineers. If we can hook these up to your turrets, we can link it all together with the Ambler and your turrets will </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">automatically</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> start tracking based on the output data! Even if your main steam power is lost, this fella here will keep it all running.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Njk3MjA2MWRkNTQ1MTI4YTFlNzAzNDQ5MjE1NmZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like a mechanical brain…” Serena murmured, thinking of the weapons Amelia had talked about.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmRmZWNiODA0YTRmMWI5NTAyZDc0MTNlZWU5Y2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly, Captain!” Lange nodded happily. “This is what I’ve been ordered to install in your three pods. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeances’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> pods are standardised, so it’ll only take about a month. Warrant Officers Watanabe and Satou are tasked with training your gunnery crews. There are practice stations at the Asamino Gunnery School they’ll be using, at least until my work is done and then you’ll be able to do live-firing training.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzMyZTdiNTM3ODRlMzViODQ2ZTY5YzgyMDNmOThm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena turned to see that her usually restrained Weapons Officer was practically hopping on his feet. “Thorne,” Serena said. “What do you think? Do you have any questions for these men?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWQ2NTlhMWM4YzQ5Nzc4MDNmMDMyMjM2MGQwYjk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, thank you, Captain!” Thorne stood up, eagerly addressing Lange. “Sergent Major, how does the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">director</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> take into account altitude?” The weapons officer became giddy with excitement when Lange pointed out the inbuilt mercury barometer. Serena knew that with long-range shots, especially against a target with a significant elevation difference, experienced gunners needed to factor in the variations in the thickness of the atmosphere the shell would be travelling through.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjFjZDRmNjA2MzQ5NzI4MjllNzA4MmQzODMyNzAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She had to admit that she was impressed with this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ambler Firing Table</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was the kind of thing Nina would drool over before disassembling it and putting it back together a dozen times before drafting blueprints for a more sophisticated version.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTNmZjIyY2Q2ODQ4NjBiZTEwNmJiM2QzNzVhYjIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The circular error probable?” Thorne asked, continuing his interrogation. “What can we expect?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDg1ODZmNWUxNDQ4ZjU5MzFkNzg3NzlmMTk1ZDkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“With you and the target in motion? Assuming your barrels are fresh… one hundred meters at ten kilometres using a four-inch system, if your engineers dial it in right.” Lange answered with a note of pride in his voice. “If one of the parties is stationary, then you can expect to maintain a hundred meters up to thirteen kilometres. If you’re both stationary and the weather is good, we’ve maintained that accuracy up to sixteen kilometres, but then you’re reaching the limits of a four-inch system.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTBiY2ViMjI4MzQ0YjU5YmNlM2FkOTJiNDE2MTcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena couldn’t help but let out a low whistle, copied by Thorne. At ten kilometres, their current gunnery crews achieved a circular error probable - the radius within which half of the fired shells fall - at three hundred meters. This would rapidly worsen to five hundred meters as they approached their maximum range. This Ambler Firing Table promised more than a threefold increase in their firing accuracy. As far as Serena was aware, that was more accurate than anything the human navies could do.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGRkZTE2MjY3OTRiZjhiZDMwZDMzODZkZWZmOTA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You mentioned it can be manually operated?” Thorne asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDQyNTdjNDUyODRjZDlhNTc1YTc2MDAwYzBjNmRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” Lange nodded. “Even if you lose all steam power, including the backup, then you can manually input the values using the dials. You see here, there are sections for your current altitude, direction and speed? The switches here will override the information coming from the steam pipes. These are for the target's azimuth and elevation, and these are for the bearing and speed. The bottom ones here are for the level of charge you’re firing at. Input all that in and then…” Lange manoeuvred himself to one side of the table, reaching down and cranking a heavy-looking handle.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzYzMjljZjIwMDQ3YWVhNmRlODVkYmEwOWNhMDdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, nothing happened; the only sound was the quiet whirling of the rotating gears, which was slightly muted through the glass. Then, the firing table began producing a symphony of clicks and clacks. This noise reached a crescendo until hundreds of distinct clicks could be heard every second. Then, without warning, the flipdot display lit up, the aetherlight behind it providing enough contrast for Serena and Thorne to read out the displayed value.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmFlMTQ5Zjc2NTQxMmVhMDY2ZTFhYzhlZDg0MzM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bearing sixty, elevation ten point five degrees,” Thorne murmured.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGFhNDA0OTEzMzRhMTViODNkNThiODNjNzQ5ZWQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s just the first cycle,” explained Lange as he continued to rotate the crank. “It’s calculating the required parabolic arc, and each cycle evaluates the next term in the sequence.” A moment later, the flipdot changed to slightly different values, and a few seconds later, it changed again. This happened six times before it ceased changing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjU3NTA2ZDczNDQyYWRhYmE2NTY3NTFkMGU4MDY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">director</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> calculates seven terms,” Lange explained, not stopping his physical exercise. “That’s sufficient for three decimal places. Now, Officer, try and change a value.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjEwOGJhYjQ5NDQzOWQ4MThhOWU5NzE5ZjBhN2Q3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thorne obliged and adjusted a dial representing the target elevation. With the change made, Lange continued to operate the table and a moment later the flipdot display changed to reflect the newly calculated parabolic arc.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTAzNDlkYzhmNjQ0Njc4NGMyNDNlN2UwY2FkNzAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I admit, I’m impressed,” Serena said, folding her arms. She might not like these changes being forced upon her by Intelligence, but she couldn’t deny the combat effectiveness they would gain from it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzgzOWU3ZGRjZTQ4MTg4OTFiMDdmYTQxYzFmZjc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One of the greatest feats of demon engineering I’ve ever witnessed,” Lange said, stopping his operation of the firing table and standing back up. “Not even the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Oshiro-class</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> has these installed. They only entered production four months ago. These </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">directors</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> have been configured with years of real-world targeting data from over a hundred naval engagements. I’m surprised they’ve prioritised a light-cruiser such as the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” the demon shrugged. “Hells, who am I to complain? I’m just happy to work with such a machine.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmM4ZDliZjI0MTQ1M2Y4NTdiYWE3MWZiMTVhMjNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When can you start?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzY1OWUxY2NmYzQ2NmQ5MmVmZTU4YmFiZTcwMmMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The installation? Today. If your Weapons Officer and Chief Engineer can give us a walkthrough of your pods, we’ll start drafting a work schedule. The Warrant Officers can show your gunnery crews to new lodgings in Asamino for training. Best they get started as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmYxZjU3OTQ2MDQ5OGQ4MjMyZGI3OWU3NjI4Mjlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena nodded, turning to Thorne. “Thorne, find Allston and show these men what they need. Send an aethergram to the barracks and get your gunnery crews here.” She turned towards the Sergeant Major. “I’m teaching a semester in the Asamaywa Officer Academy. If anything urgent comes up, you can find me there. Regardless, I expect I’ll come down and check up on things every few days. Dismissed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGMyMWY3NGQ4YTQxN2I5YzM2NjA2ZDVlZjJhNWVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With her orders given, the men set about their tasks. Giving the machine one final look, Serena left the room to find Aiden standing awkwardly. When he saw her, he grinned sheepishly and nervously rubbed the back of his neck.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2Y5MjVjMDZlZDQzMThiNTdkOTdjYWY1ZmQ5ZWZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Halen, I don’t have long…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmNjNGFhNDQzNjQ4NDhiNWRkMWM3NTFlODMyNjUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This won’t take long,” Serena said, trying to keep herself from snapping. She dragged Aiden into a nearby room. Once inside, she locked the door before turning on the man and giving him her best intimidating glare. To emphasise her displeasure, she deliberately walked slowly towards him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjU4YTBhM2FkMzRjNzBhZTllNGM1ZGVhMzY0M2Y4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aiden,” she said, making her voice sickly sweet. “Guess what I found out the other day?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDcxMWZiNTMxOTQxZjZhYmRmMzFhZjdmODMwN2Qz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s that?” Aiden replied, backing away until his back hit a cabinet.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDk1MjY5YzE4MTQyMTU4ZjI2MGZkOGQzZTJhY2E5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia’s got a new assistant, did you know?” Not waiting for an answer, she continued, “An assistant that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">just so happens</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be the same student you met when Amelia healed her broken arm. An assistant who claims that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">before</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> we left Kenhoro, she was approached about an opportunity to become an assistant to a mysterious </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Asamaywa. She said the Grandmaster put her name forward, but I have this terrible </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">feeling</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that it might have been </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjI1YWU2YzM2YTQ2NjE5ZmRhZmZiNjhjNTZiMmU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena raised an arm, visibly making Aiden cringe. She placed it above his shoulder, leaning into him. It felt good to be tall. “Surely I must be mistaken? Because that would mean that you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lied</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to me when you said you were just in Kenhoro for a personality profile, wouldn’t it? It would mean you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">knew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> about that bastard Chesterfield’s plan to have Amelia and me come here, wouldn’t it? You wouldn’t know anything about that, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">would you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Nzk4OWI3YmUzNzRhOTY4ZWE3ODJhY2E1M2IzMjFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, Serena, look here,” Aiden began.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODRhMDE0YjdlZDQzYzU4MjhjOWM0ZWVkMTVhZjQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena raised her other fist, clenching it tightly. Before she could intimidate Aiden any more, he suddenly squealed out, “If you hurt me, I’ll tell Amelia!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjgyMTg2NGIwMjRiM2U5NjNmZjM0MjI3MmI4NzM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A long silence passed between them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODMxNWIzMjNkZDQxYzg5OGVhMGY2Yjg1OTNiMGUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Serena straightened up, stepping back to make space between them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGFhYmY4ODE4YjRhYzY5MDBlOGVhMTVmN2QyZDVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Another long silence passed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGExMTM1ZDVkMzQ0MGY4MGE3Zjc2ZTA5MTg2NDI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seven hells, Aiden…” Serena mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWRlYTk3NWQ5ODQzZDI5YmRmOWM2MmY3M2Q1OWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjAyYzYwZDQxNzRlOTRhNzEyMTQ5MmJiNDJiOTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWQ4YTJhMTgwODQ3OTA5NDJkNDkyMmQ4YWU5YzNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, don’t tell her, please?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTZlODE0ZTY2ZTRlYTc4NDJhNTViNmI4M2ZhZmU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was pathetic! Ha!” Serena snorted, chuckling at the now red-faced demon before her. “That might be the saddest thing I’ve ever heard you say. Look at you! An </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Officer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> running around tattling about their problems to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWYyYjA5YzY4YTQ5OWI5NmY3ZmRkZmRlODg3NzI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bah!” Aiden groaned. “Just don’t tell her, please! I panicked, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWRlMTNkMjBmZTQzYTZiMGY1OGZjNDhlYjkwYmJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Panicked? What did you think I was going to do to you!” Serena scoffed. In her eyes, she had every right to be angry at her so-called friend, but she wouldn’t cause him any </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">actual</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> harm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDVjNjQzMzkxZjQyMzk4NmY2YTc2NGNkOWFhZjg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe a tiny bit?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjNlZTIzNDEyMDRhMTE4ZmQ3NmE5MDk5ODcxNTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, err,” Aiden shuffled on his feet awkwardly. “Had that look in your eye, Serena.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjhmNjc0Yzg0ZDRhOGE5MmY0OTY0YjU2N2M3YWE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What look!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2M2NzYxMDQ2YzRiNzJiNDE0OWQ4NTdmZDE4MmNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know… look, never mind!” Aiden put his hands up in a gesture of peace. “I’m not told everything! I don’t know exactly what was decided and when, but I do know </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” he curled one hand into a pointed finger, emphasising his point. “When Amelia healed you, and the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">denied the Dragon access to her, someone </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> high up decided to prioritise bringing Amelia over to the demon side with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">no expense spared</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Something about the ship protecting her set off alarm bells. They were going to imprison and interrogate her, and now, Amelia could probably ask for a Greatlord’s territory and they’ll give it to her if it would secure her loyalty! That’s how important she is to the people up top!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjM2ZDhlODBiMDRhMTY5MGZjZmRiZWJhNDIzN2I4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And then… when our agents discovered that you two were, you know, a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Aiden’s eyes darted to the side, and Serena felt an unavoidable blush form. “Whatever plans they had with her now encompassed you as well. At one point, I think they planned to persuade her to become a student at the Academy for the full two years, with you teaching, but </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">then</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” he raised another finger, “Then, she invoked </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">everything</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> changed! And not in a good way!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmUzMmRiODdkZTQ3OGFiNDk2NzU5MWY0MDhhY2M2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How so?” Serena asked, feeling her forehead furrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjQ3NzEwNzA2MTQ1OTZiNDUxM2YxNGExMzY3MDcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s mostly rumours, but I heard that the Intelligence apparatus dedicated to infiltration and monitoring Christdom and its allies </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">tripled</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> overnight. These are not just passive measures but active ones as well. I’m hearing whispers of everything from sabotage campaigns to a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">pre-emptive strike</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmZmMzQwMTNkNjRhYjI5NTc3YmEzMTBjODlmNDhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nonsense,” Serena said. “The Empress wouldn’t order another front. We’re currently winning in the Republican war. We have the numbers, the material, the ships. We overmatch them in everything.” The current approach Cascadia took in the conflict was a war of attrition. They had long destroyed the main combat force the Republican side possessed pre-war. Now, they mainly were chipping away at unmotivated conscripts. If the human nations wanted their military aid to be used ineffectively by the struggling Republican army, then that was a deal that worked for the demons! “They have no pathway to victory, and everyone knows it. Why would we spoil our advantage by stretching ourselves with another theatre?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWRlNjZiOTZjZjQyOGJhMjk5N2UyZTQzYzdjZDIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, my thoughts exactly, but listen to this…” Aiden leaned in, lowering his voice. “I still have contacts from my time in logistics. You know what I’m hearing from those guys? Massive expansion of production lines. Everything from raw resource extraction to smelting. Extraction companies in the desert have been awarded huge contracts to find more red. Why else but the mass production of explosives? And it’s all kept quiet. No announcements. It's the same thing with shipbuilders; believe me, they aren’t laying down hulls for civilian ships. No one wants to admit it, but all the signs are there. We’re preparing for war at a scale never before seen by either demon or human hands!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTZmOGVhNGM0ZTQzZDRiNjZlNzlkMTBhNzkyZmI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A great conflict…” Serena trailed off, her thoughts wrapped in confusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzRiMWYwOWIwYTRlZTRhZmI1OWU2MzE3NzIxYTFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A conflict, judging by what I’ve been hearing, is expected to be waged against any and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">all</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> enemies. Not just Christdom, but their allies and anyone else. And if Christdom and their allies go to war, the rest of the human nations would follow, either against us or each other. You’re aware of the military alliances on the human continent. It’s a powderkeg waiting to ignite.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGVjZTVlMzM4ZDRkYWViY2UxOTc0YTY1YjkzZjZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena was quiet for a long while before saying the phrase which refused to leave her mind unless it was spoken out loud.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzE3ZTdkYmM5YTRlM2FhNjYyMmYwMzBmODU0MDAw" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A World War…”</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Fifty-Nine: A Knife In The Night</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM2NGYyNzdkZTBmZDQ0MThiOTdlM2I1Njc2OGYwMTUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Noburu POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/noburu.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmNjZjI2ODBhMjQxNjA5MjY0ZDRhZjEwZTJjZjUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the occasional hiss of steam, the plateau lift continued trundling its way up the cliff face towards Asamaywa. Peering over the railing and looking down, Noburu could see the slums fade away until they merged into one great smear of gloom and grey. As the distance grew, he felt a growing sense of liberation. Living in the slums was a sordid experience; he always felt a little dirty, no matter how much he washed. He somehow felt cleaner by riding the lift and rising above it all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDgyN2FiZDFkNDQwNTFhMDI2NDgwZjg5YTNiMzgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He glanced at the woman next to him. Seonmi stood tall, wearing the uniform Yoshiro provided them both. There was no way the lift guards would’ve allowed them through with how they usually looked, even with a bribe, so they’d been forced to get into character immediately and use their forged travel permits. The guards barely gave them a second look before letting them through.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTg3YjRhY2EwMjQwNzM5ZGQ1NmNmYTAzNWI1MTY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth was that as long as you look and act the part, people will naturally assume you are who you say you are. A grimy slum-dweller wearing patchy clothes trying to charm his way through the gates would never succeed. However, Noburu and Seonmi, with their good posture, clean uniforms, documents, and well-spoken accents, didn’t face such scrutiny. No one suspected they were destitute and scraping by on the bottom rung of society.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTlhZGRiYTc1NDRhNjhhZTUxZjI1NWUwOTk1ZDg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seonmi was looking out at the vast expanse of the lowlands with a neutral expression. Noburu had known the woman for nearly five years now. She’d been the one to introduce him to Yoshiro. She possessed an interesting mix of Manwese and Ainese features: sharp eyes with thick-based horns that ended in the stereotypical Ainese twist. Those very same sharp eyes now glanced his way. They weren’t as crimson as his own. Instead, they were a memorable blood-orange.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDg3Y2RhMTA0OTQ1MGM4MWJlOGIzMDg4Zjc2MGM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He suspected she might have been highborn. Something about how she carried herself, even in the slums, reminded her of himself. He’d once heard a rumour of a sister called Haneul, and suspected Seonmi might be estranged in some manner, but he’d never investigated it further. If you start poking about in other people's business, then they’ll do the same to you, and when people poke others in the shadow of Asamaywa, it’s often done with the pointy bit of a knife.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzQ2MWIwNzU5OTRhYzBiY2FhM2YzNDhkMjg2NjI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?” she asked, her voice soft.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTEwNjRmNWRiODRiY2NhOTQ4NjhmZmRmOWExY2Fm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re being quiet,” he murmured before pointing to her white-knuckled hands gripping the lift’s railings. “Not fond of heights?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjZhYTY2Y2VjZTQyOTQ5MzFjMDk2MWZjMzExNTdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just… looking at the ships,” Seonmi replied. She nodded skywards. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzE4Yjk4N2NiNTRkYWQ5MmY3MmUyZTM4M2UyZDcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu followed her direction to see a light frigate escorting a transport into the docks above. A year ago, transports rarely needed a convoy guard but now it was far more frequent a sight. He’d heard guards whispering about increased piracy in the south. Perhaps that’s where that ship had sailed from?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDBiMjg2MWQ2NjQwMWE5YjZiNDViOTFkMTU1ZDI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you know how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">expensive</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it is to keep those things in the air?” Seonmi said. “How much money it costs to buy the crystal fuel? Think about how much </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">food</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you could buy. And the military expenditure…” She shook her head. “Every manufactured shell could be a sack of rice. It just feels so… wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGJmMzlhMTFmYzQwZDU4NzAzMjJkNjIxMTNmYzZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...I know,” Noburu replied. After you’ve been poor and hungry for long enough, your worldview develops in one of two ways: Either you become indifferent to your struggle, seeing your place in society as a natural inevitability, or, as Noburu had, you become angry at the wealthy spending so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">much</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> on frivolous items. Why spend so much gold on some paint on canvas or that porcelain vase from Hokanai when you could feed a hundred orphans for a year instead?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDM4NDFiYmMyODQ4ZDViNWU1MWQ1NjdkZTBlNDli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It's why he never felt bad for stealing from them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWQzYmY2YzdlOTQ5ZjU5NmFmMzkxMGUxZDc0NGFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu disagreed on one point. The ship wasn’t a waste. Sure, the shells inside them were wasteful, but the ship itself? A ship was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">freedom</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. A ship meant untold prospects and opportunities. If he could save up and buy even a small fishing ship, then he just needed to make one catch of sardis, and he’d be set for decades. He could take Kiku and the kids away from their life of poverty and into the clean air of the upper-sky!</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmZhZjE3NTk3ZTQ3OWI5Mjk3OTUzODg3NjA3MTFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if he couldn’t do that, he could get everyone on a train to a new life. Far below him, the lowlands were etched with the steel of the Eastern Railway. Tracks stretched from the base of Asamaywa out into the lowlands before breaking off into the north, east, and south. The northbound tracks snaked through industrial areas and farming towns before curving back towards Asamoto. To the east, they stretched into the horizon, where on a day with better weather, he would have been able to make out the mountain tops of Nachon more than two hundred kilometres away. The last few tracks turned south, either linking up to Asamino or going to the Far Eastern cities of Fengra and Hokanai.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTUxZmUzMTE1ZTQxY2JhNWM3N2U2Y2ZkNGYzZTRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">His true home that he didn’t remember.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzkzYTgxNDBhMTQ3Zjc5NTliNmI5ZTBhYzUzZjQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The lift shuddered and hissed as it came to a stop. Noburu gave himself a quick mental slap to put him in character. A glance and nod from Seonmi told him she’d done the same. They queued up where a bored-looking customs officer was filtering through documents. When it came to Noburu and Seonmi, he raised an eyebrow, his gaze flittering from the travel documents to them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmMxMzQyNDRjZjRiMTc4NTk3ODU2YTVkOTBmZmJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Says here you came trainbound from Fengra to Asamaywa, but you got off early in the lowlands. Why’d you stop, eh…” He flicked back to their identification documents. “Miss Yoo-jung? What business did you have down below?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTUxODQ5MzY3MzQwYjNiZDNjMDI0ZGU5Y2I0ODY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We got an aethergram before we left,” Seonmi answered immediately. “Farmers thought they might have found something ploughing the fields. We stopped by to consult. Turned out to be nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2M4ZjMyNzAyMjQ5ZmY4YTAwN2ZmYmYxY2JiM2Ew" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” the customs officer yawned. “And you, Mr Kim, what’s your business in Asamaywa?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWZiYjM1ZmQ3YzRlNWNiZmZjOWY5Y2VhZThlZWVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Restoration work at the Asamaywa Officer Academy,” Noburu answered. “Twenty-day contract. It’s all there in the yellow sheet." He gestured to the document in the officer's hands. The demon skimmed it before returning everything to them and jerking his thumb.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODY5MzFjMDA1ODQyNTZhNDU2OGYwYjI4ODIyMDhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go through,” he intoned.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODI4NmI1YjA3YjRlM2ZhM2YyYjFmNGJjYmU4YTgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanking the officer, the pair passed and entered Asamaywa proper. Noburu had only had cause to enter the city a few times, but every time he did, it surprised him how much </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">louder</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it was. Hundreds of demons moved this way and that, with yells and bells filling the air. It was a stark contrast to the threatening silence that permeated the slums.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDc3Zjc2MGI0NzRiNzNhNWI2ZmNiMGIxNGM4OTc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two walked through the city, stopping only a few times to get their bearings. Soon, they found their pre-booked accommodation and signed in. It was a small, slightly run-down hotel sectioned off from the main streets. The owner showed them to their rooms before leaving them to themselves.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGQ0ODA1OTllODRkNGViNDQ5OTU0MGNkMzE0NjBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu pressed an ear to the closed door, only giving Seonmi a nod when the owner's footsteps had disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjJhMjBlMjA5NDRlMmNhNmI2MmYxNDRhNWNjMTYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Once we’re in the academy, hells, when we’re even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">near</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it, we need to make sure we only communicate with signals,” Seonmi said, yawning and stretching out on the cheap mattress.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjUzNTcyZGIzYTQ5MDU4MDllMjM4MGM1YTA5ZGNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Noburu replied. Everyone knew that warriors and mages had ways to increase their perception. They had a hawk's eyes, a wolfhound's ears, and the reaction speed of a sardis. They would be quite literally surrounded by them in the academy, which meant they couldn’t afford to even whisper to each other about their true intentions. They could only communicate with hand signals when they were sure they weren’t in sight of anyone else.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzE1ZWE5NDQ4MjRmMTA5MDFiNjFkZmY0ZTU3NzMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What now? Tools?” He asked. He’d spent the last several days absorbing as much knowledge as he could about artefacts and restoration. He’d spent long hours in Yoshiro’s den practising using the equipment he was supposed to have mastered - everything to sell the illusion that they knew what they were doing. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjM5MzFjMDgzNDRjY2Y5NDI0ODQxMGM5NTE3Y2Mx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of bringing the aged and half-broken tools they’d practised on, Yoshiro gave Seonmi enough money for them to buy everything they needed. They would look for good quality second-hand sets or purchase new ones and then quickly weather the tools. Then, they planned to spend the little time they had left practising further before the arranged meeting inside the academy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjIzYjQxMTU1YjQ3ZmY5NjhlNWRjZDQ3NWM2OTI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">All they needed was to get inside and locate the target artefacts they were tasked with stealing. Then, all Seonmi needed to do was make an excuse to leave, leaving Noburu alone with the items he could steal and then escape using his blessing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2YyN2JjNDQ0MDQ1MTdhOWFiYWIzNjFhMDJlNDA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He tapped his horns reassuringly. </span></p>

<p class="cnMxMGQ4MzhhMzJmZjQxMDA4YmRmZWRhNzQ0MjBiYWJl" style="margin-bottom: 2em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia felt rather proud of herself. She’d decided on the bright idea of simultaneously fulfilling both Hinako’s request for tutoring </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Mel’s request for sparring. She’d taken advantage of her academy privileges and booked out a training room, arranging to meet the two women there at the allotted time. Serena had invited herself along, claiming that her expertise would help evaluate Mel’s swordsmanship. However, Amelia suspected Serena really wanted to make sure Amelia wouldn’t do something </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">too </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">amazing and cause more problems.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmY5ZmNmNGY0NDRkZjRiY2U1NGUyZWI4MDg1MTlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a little surprised when she stepped through the door to find Mel, Hinako, and Serena with no less than three additional students! All six demons turned simultaneously and set their gazes upon Amelia. Serena’s eyes carried the most familiarity, followed by Mel, then Hinako, and finally, the three students, whose faces possessed a mixture of excitement, wonder, and apprehension.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDMwYTlkNzhiZjQ4ZTE4ZjY5YzczYzU1OTBmZmU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The first unfamiliar demon was a male whose features reminded Amelia of Katalin. He had reddish-brown hair and purple eyes - a Northerner. The man clearly took pride in honing his body. He was well built, although not quite at Tomes's or Dagon's level.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTVmOTlhMmIwZTQ0MWY4ZDBlYzUxNDdjZTU5ZjEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Notably, the remaining two unfamiliar students, one male and one female, possessed only a single horn curving out from the center of their forehead. It was a variation of demon horns that Amelia had learned was more common in the ethnic Aindo part of the demon race centred around the Far Eastern cities of Nachon, Fengra, and Hokanai. Their eyes were a fascinating burnt orange, starkly contrasting the typical crimson hues she’d gotten used to being around the ethnic Samino like Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2EwNmJjM2NhYjQ0ODE5MTMzMzZkZDFmMzRiZDA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They both possessed extremely similar features. Perhaps they were brother and sister?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWY3YTUwODI0YzQ2YjdhZDhmM2E0NTgzNzMxYWQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning!” Amelia exclaimed cheerfully, walking up to the group.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTk2YWQ3NDhlMzRkMzJiN2ZhNTcwYjVkMmIyZDFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assistant Instructor Thornheart!” the group of students intoned. Mel and Hinako bowed while the three students Serena brought along snapped to attention with a salute. The northern demon stood with his right hand in a closed fist on the left side of his chest in what Amelia had learned from Katalin as the traditional northern salute. Meanwhile, the two Aindo students performed the standard Imperial salute of raising their hands to their temple.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTA1ZDdiNmUyODQ5Yjg5ZWNjNmNlNjRmYWUyZTdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">So cool! Only…</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTVkYmNiZGMxNzQ4MTBhNWE5ZmQ1YzU0MzZmNDYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t salute,” Serena said, clicking her tongue. “She’s not in the chain of command.” Once the three students had dropped their salutes, Serena gestured towards the Northerner and explained, “Amelia, this is Second-Year Flakken Holm from Fiegerfel. He finished his training deployment and is due to graduate this semester. And these,” Serena waved towards the two one-horned Aindo students. “Are Ido and Arin Song, from…?” Serena trailed off, raising an eyebrow at them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmU5ODFkMGQxNjRhMjE4MmUzMDRmZDBiOGY0ZGY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahoe Village!” Ido exclaimed, his posture as straight as a plank of wood.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTdjOWM2OTY2MDQwYTdiMDY0ZWMyYmU1YThkM2Nh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s in the Fengra lowlands!” Arin continued, her posture matching her brother's.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTY0N2RlMjM3ZDRmZmFhNGIyNjkxMWI0NDgxMGVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s an honour to meet you, Assistant Instructor Thornheart!” Ido said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWVjZDQ4OGRjYzQxNjU5NDlkMThkNjBlYTc3YmEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If a human such as yourself became a Lord-Prospect, then us lowborn have a chance!” Arin added with a grin before realising what she had said and sheepishly apologising.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDU2N2U4MmEzZTQwYWQ5MzY1MGJjMjM3NzMwYTE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia giggled. “It’s nice to meet you! I like your horns! They’re so pretty!” Her compliment had the desired effect, with the brother and sister touching their horns and mumbling to each other, “Whoa, she said she liked them!”. On the other hand, Serena simply rolled her eyes in the background.</span></p><span class="cjQwNGY2OWNjOGU4ODQ5NDdhMTU4MjE1NTBmMmNlMjYz"><br/>The tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMxYjEwOTJkZTVhODQzYWFiYWU0ZWZhNjJiYjE0Yjk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice to meet you as well, Flakken,” Amelia intoned cheerfully. “Other than Katalin, you’re the only other Northener I’ve seen in the academy! What made you travel all the way down here?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTBkZDljZWRlYTRlMGE4MDY3ZGMxOWNkMWIwZjc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Better prospects, Assistant Instructor Thornheart,” Flakken replied. Apparently, the man didn’t do small talk because that was the end of his explanation. Thankfully, Serena spoke before the silence could develop into something awkward.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzZiOGRlOGU0MzQwNTU5ZjQxOGZhOGIwYzVmYjNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Flakken’s orange is solid,” Serena explained. “He’ll likely reach yellow within a year. Ido and Arin have both reached orange and need to spend a few months solidifying it. That’s what I’ve offered to help with. They are…” She paused as if looking for the right words. “Prospective talents?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWQ1YTFkZjk1OTRjNmM4OTUyMzdlNDE5MTZmYWE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh,” Amelia nodded. “I see!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDFlYmRhZjgxYzQyMTU5NTFlNzM2YjE2NzgwNzll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She hadn’t forgotten the original purpose of them coming here. Serena was looking for prospects to build out an elite team of mages and warriors so they could fulfil the mysterious task set out by Chesterfield to collect the lost shards of a shattered soul. They had to be picky with who they chose, looking for talents that were both skilled but also without too much bias regarding humankind. These students - Flakken, Ido and Arin - were prospective recruits!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWYzMmVmOTJhNTRiNmZhMzQ4ODA4MmQ5NDViNTFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As for you, Melanie Mori,” Serena intoned, turning her gaze towards Mel. “I can see you’re on the verge of crossing into orange. That’s good. We’ll make that step in the coming weeks and see how you hold against Amelia’s red.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDA4MTI5YTRiNTQ5YjU4N2U5MzZlOTJlOWEwOTVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-red?” Mel’s eyes widened. She turned to face Amelia. “You’ve formed red?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjA3NmE2NGIzMzRiYzBiMjQ0OWNjOTRkNzRlNDVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah!” Amelia gave the girl an encouraging thumbs up. “Remember, I told you I was close?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGE3NjhlYjE3OTRjZWZiNjNjYWRhNzc0YTg5MWQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…” Mel mumbled before tightening her fists until the knuckles were white. She didn’t appear upset; Amelia could practically see the determination oozing out of her. It seemed like Amelia’s recent success had ignited Mel’s spirit! </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzE2M2ZhNGQwMDQyNTE4MDZiNTEzMjFiNDNlYmI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the initial introductions finished, Amelia and Serena conducted their personalised training sessions. With Serena taking all four warrior candidates aside, Amelia felt a little short with just Hinako. However, when it came time to begin the session, she was glad Hinako was the only mage she had to tutor.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDZlY2Y5ODMxMjQyNmI4YzA1NDFlNzdjMDM1ZTYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her prior talk with Sarafina proved to be fruitful. Amelia took Hinako aside and cheerfully explained that she had unusual circumstances and that despite her magical achievements, Amelia lacked a proper formal education in magical theory. After receiving this explanation, Hinako nodded as if she had been expecting that all along.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGVlMDkzOWU0MTRmYzliYzk0OGZjNjQ5N2QxMGZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako explained she was struggling with forming </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> second-circle wards and attacks efficiently and that if Amelia exaggerated the construction of the formations while flaring her aether, Hinako would be able to follow along and develop her own understanding by sensing Amelia’s aether flows.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTVjOWU5YWI3NzRiOTBiNTg2YjIzNjdiNzc4ZmFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Amelia understood that what Hinako </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thought </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">she meant by flaring and what Amelia’s flaring would </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">actually </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">be were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">different. Not wanting to cause Serena more problems or have the grandmaster shout at her again, she requested Hinako display her best effort. The student obliged, and through this, Amelia got a rough estimate of the level of aether she should demonstrate.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjZiZDUzN2ExMTQxMjA4YTNjMDM0ZGMxODJkNDAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The lesson continued, and Amelia quickly discovered, to Hinako's amazement and frustration, that how Amelia constructed formations was unusual compared to the standard way that was formally taught in the academy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWUyNmU4MWMyZDQyYjFiNmFkMmYxYWNmZjA4YmE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Where Hinako rigidly constructed her spell in discrete steps, each building upon the previous to form the final complicated structure, Amelia’s aether simply formed into the final construction almost immediately. The method wasn’t entirely unknown; Hinako explained that expert duelists spent thousands of hours refining specific spells using a similar technique called Simultaneous Construction. However, the way Amelia did it was more </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">elegant</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">refined </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">than anything Hinako had seen or read about before.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTk2YWJiZTE0ZjQwZTY5YmQ4ZDczOTNkYTBlMDU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just can’t fathom how it all comes together so fast! It’s like one continuous flow of aether, never getting in the way of itself!” Hinako shook her head. “I can’t see myself reaching this level even if I spend my entire life practising!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWE1MzJlMDRjMTRmYzZiNzc5NDg2MTI4ZjM1NDk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Think of it like learning an instrument,” Amelia offered. “When you first try, you’re thinking of everything from the position of your hands to how hard you pluck the strings. As you practise, bits will automatically fall into place, freeing up your focus so you can pay full attention to other bits!” It wasn’t the best analogy she could come up with; Amelia never had the energy to learn an instrument in her previous life. A better example might be her experience in raids from the game, where after hundreds of hours in perfecting her skill rotations, making minor adaptions to different scenarios was surprisingly easy. Unfortunately, that was an analogy she was sure Hinako wouldn’t understand.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzkwMDZhZmMyNzQ2MmM5ZTFmOWFkNDMzYzI5ZjE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako seemed determined to learn Amelia’s method of spell construction and requested to see her aether flowing again and again. By the end of the lesson, Hinako claimed she was close to getting a ward to activate using Amelia’s intuitive method.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjVjZDA2MjkwZjRhZTE5YzkwZmJiYzBiZDEzYTJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure learning this way is going to help you?” Amelia asked, her brow furrowing slightly, concerned at how tired Hinako looked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjI4MDg2YzY4MjQyNDI5ODc2ZmM2ZDM0NzJkZDM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think so,” Hinako answered, wiping sweat from her face. “The Imperial Stepwise method of spell construction is suitable for most people, but the way you use this… Simultaneous Construction method definitely has a higher efficiency ceiling if you put in enough time!” She took a few breaths. “Not to mention, the potential time saved is critical in professional duelling! Even a half-second advantage can differentiate between a win and a loss!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTkyMTdmMjI3NTRiMDFhMTdhZTZlNzNmMTJjYzRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hinako came from a family of semi-famous mage duelists and was determined to follow in their footsteps. Hinako explained that she planned to graduate, do her time as a mage in the army or navy, then be honourably discharged from the military and pursue a career as a duelist. There were half a dozen public arenas in the Three Sisters, always open to welcoming a new talent. Hinako could build a name for herself in those arenas and then move on up elsewhere. The sport was apparently massive in Centralis and the South.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjgwNDVlMzQ2NTQ4NjliNDJlNWNlN2FlMDcwOTA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With Hinako nearly exhausting her aether reserves, the session ended naturally. Amelia felt like she hadn’t done much other than sit there and be observed while she formed spells, but Hinako seemed satisfied.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjQ2ZDZlZGNkYTQzOTk5YzM4MGJkODVjOGJhMDIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia turned to see that Mel and the faces of Flakken, Ido, and Arin were ashen and tense. They were all forced to hold their swords out in an exaggerated </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">zenkutsu-dachi</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> front stance. By the exhaustion on their faces, they’d been holding that stance for a long time. Some of their arms would shake and lower slightly, but a quick tap with Serena’s sword would have them straighten again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTk0MDYwNjAyZTQxMmM5MGUwZmUyODJmYmM2ZDVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Amelia finished, Serena barked, “Relax!” The four students gasped as they returned to a more natural standing position, lowering their arms with visible relief. “Bow!” Serena ordered. The students snapped to attention and bowed deeply. Serena returned the bow, signalling the end of the lesson.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzQxYzc0M2EwYTQxZGZhMTA5MmJjMWY5ZGRjYzZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While the tired students formed an impromptu group to recover and drink water, Serena pulled Amelia to the side. “How’d it go?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODk2NmY2ODE0YzQwZTNiMTkzOWE2MmRhZDZkOTgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good!” Amelia flashed a thumbs up. “I only really demonstrated spells, but it seems it helped her a lot!” She nodded her head towards the recovering warriors. “Where did you find them?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzhlYWU5MTQyNjQ4MDM4Mzg1MDRmYzI1MmRmNmJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They stood out to me,” Serena explained. “Flakken voiced his interest in learning from me, and I accepted because he’s been the only one brave enough to ask. As for the twins, I overheard them defending you to some other students.” Serena dropped her voice low. “They’re from the Fengra lowlands - not an easy place to move up from. Their finding a placement here is a testament to their determination and talent. They’ve probably faced some discrimination for their horns, so they probably feel like their situation is similar to yours.” Serena’s mouth moved into a sly smile. “They’re also a pair of enthusiastic idiots that want to travel the world, so I thought they’d be a perfect fit.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmIzZThjMDg0MTQ3MjE5MTRhNjkwYmMwYTY3YmZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi!” Amelia protested.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjU1M2JmMzU5NzQ0YWRiZDEyMWY2NGFlNWM1NzUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on,” Serena motioned, hiding a smile. “Let’s arrange a time for the next session, and then…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGQ0MTUxZjcyNDQ4ZTY4N2Y2MzAyZDMyMThiMWE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then?” Amelia raised an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmNiNWQ4MjQ3NDQ4NmI5YjUxNzU3ZTc5Y2Q4MmVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then we can have some </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">private</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> training. Work on your, uh, aura,” Serena mumbled, not meeting Amelia’s eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2JmYWMzZWU2ODQzNGM5YjQ2NGM3YWQ4MTg0OGZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure!” Amelia giggled. Honestly, her girlfriend was just insatiable. What devilish influence had turned the infamous Captain Halen into such a risque demon?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzNiZWU5MGQ2OTQ2NjJiZDE3NTAyNzIwMDEwOWVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that she was complaining!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWJhMTVlN2Y1YTQ0ODI5Zjg1MDFmZjVjMmMwZTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2N2I2NjU4ZGNjZTQ2MWRiYmE0ZTE0OGEyZjI2MTJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><img alt="New Scene - Mel POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/mel.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM1NTVmMmFmMGViZTQ4MTY4N2I3NDRkODc0MDQxZDYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel woke to silence. She looked up, and her dark bedroom ceiling looked back. Why had she woken? She’d been fast asleep, and now she felt wide awake. Did she have a bad dream?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjdmNzJkZTA0MzRlZjg5Njk2YmU4N2UzYjZmNzI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She sat up, rubbing her aching shoulders. Instructor Halen had put her and her fellow students through one of the most intense training sessions she’d ever had. Still, if that was what it took to break into orange and defeat Amelia’s red aura, then so be it!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2M5OWExYjQxNDQxZTI5NWJlZTQxNGU5MGQ3MmUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The nighttime chill made her shiver, so Mel manifested her red aura, relying on its supernatural properties to protect her from the cold. She reached for a cup of water by her bedside, suddenly freezing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGVmZDRkNWM3YzQ1ODI4YzY0NGRmOWY2YzM3NmI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was that?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDkyNTAxZjE4ODRiNzdiNDI4MmNlZmZjYmNiMWM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A subtle creak from next door. A movement of the floorboards.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjNjY2NjODdjYjQzZDlhM2Y2OTQxYzdlOTQxN2Y0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Had Amelia returned? Once again, she’d told Mel she wouldn’t return that night. Mel had started to wonder if she really did have a man or if something else was going on. Regardless, it would be problematic if she stuck her horns into someone else’s business. Amelia seemed to have a favourable opinion of Mel and she didn’t want to ruin that.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTg4MWVkZDUxZjQwNzA5MzUwYTkxOWExMTA0NGMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Another creak.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTg2ZWVmM2NmNTQ5N2ZhMzA4MjA2ZDdhZDFhYzhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel climbed out of bed. She didn’t need to wear her uniform; she would only check if Amelia wanted anything. She was awake anyway, so she might as well fulfil her duties.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGJiNGRlZGYwOTRiMTM5MWIyYjgxMDE5NDU2OGEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lighting a lantern, Mel exited her room. She strode the length of the corridor, stopping outside Amelia’s room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWYzMDRjODVlMjRmMDA4ZjI5ZjY1NWE1NWM2MTYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Quiet.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWM4NzViYzBjYjQ0ZmQ5ZDYxMjdkNDIxM2MyYTE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She knocked lightly. “Amelia?” Mel called.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmY2ZDkzZTRhYjQ1MmM4YzE3MDBhODM2MWQ3OTE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No answer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDgzNTVkODk4ZDQxYzQ4YmVkNTVlOTRmNDI0YTYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel opened the door, stepping into the darkness of Amelia’s quarters. The lantern didn’t do much to pierce the darkness, so she strained her aura a little further, enhancing her eyesight. Nothing seemed amiss in the reception area.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjdlNWRjNDMxZjQwNzE4NTBhYTgzZmQ2MjIxOWZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel proceeded into Amelia’s bedroom. Amelia’s bed lay, still tidy from when Mel made it the night before. So Amelia hadn’t returned then. Then what… ah. Mel caught sight of a window slightly ajar.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWVmOGNmZGI1ZjQ4ZWViNzViZTQzODNlYTg5ZTVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sighing, she closed the window, and as she did, the realisation that she’d closed it earlier formed in her mind. If she closed it, that meant someone opened it. If someone opened it, that meant…</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWM3NjA2N2M4NjQzOGFiM2Q0OTE5ZjUwZDMzZGJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel spun around, pushing her red until it was uncomfortable. The dark room became as clear as daylight to her. She strained her ears. Was she alone? Had someone snuck in and then left? Or were they-</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTQ2M2Q5NjQ5MjQ1YTY4YWUwZTQ5OTdiOTJlNjEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of someone’s breathing reached her ears. It was slow and methodical. She’d been taught about this in Kenhoro. A type of breathing designed to produce as little sound as possible. An assassin's breathing technique.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDhhYmM3MWJjMjQ3YmI5YmJmZmExMjE4MjRhYzcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But Mel heard it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjQwMDIxNWI5NjQ1ZDI4NTkxZTk2YjUwYWI3MjQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Without a doubt, there was someone straddled to the ceiling above her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzRkZDI3Y2FhMzQ5OTA5NGM4ZWE1YzNiZjA1YzMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel flared her red aura - a painful experience given the training she’d gone through earlier. She threw the lantern above her head and ran using aura-empowered legs towards the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2MxMWM4MzI5MzRhNWQ5MTQxNmQyMTg1MWM3NGM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She made it two steps before something pierced her left shoulder. Another two steps before something else pierced her lower back. A final two steps before something cut her leg, causing her to trip and spin around. Mel screamed, grabbing something nearby and throwing it at the dark figure as she crumpled to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDYzYzNhNDNiNjRkNzRiMTdlODVhMTNkYmY1MWZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her opponent’s figure was wavy. Some kind of cloaking spell from the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaxai</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> branch. He was a warrior. His orange aura gave that away. He ducked the thrown object - a book - and leapt towards Mel with a dagger.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2FiOWIyNzMyOTQ5Y2Q4ZDI2ZDQ0MWQ1NzVkMmE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel put everything into her aura, feeling herself burn from the inside as she manifested orange for the first time. It was a shaky, weak orange that wasn’t enough to completely stop the assassin's dagger from piercing her stomach. Mel reflexively grabbed the man’s hand, pulling her legs back and kicking him as hard as she could. He stumbled back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzU2OGMzNDZhZjRiNGFiNDgzM2NhYTVjMjEyYzM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything suddenly seemed so wet with blood. Her blood. Even as she scrambled back, her feet slipped, failing to find traction against the bloody wooden floor.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGJhMTNjMTQyZDRjMTZiZjliMjkyNTM3NWVjNjI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She couldn’t win against this person. Her orange aura was barely up to scratch, and her body felt like it would explode. Mel was already at peak aether exhaustion, and she wouldn’t be able to maintain her aura against another attack.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2NhZmI5ZWMyMTRjNDViODk2YWY4YjBhMDMzY2Iz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If only she could get to the door and out into the hall. If this assassin was here for Amelia it was unlikely he would chase Mel down. All she needed to do was make herself an unattractive target so he would flee back through the window.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGU1M2Q1Y2ZmYzRiYjViMjBjNTZhOGI2N2U4Y2Rl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hazy assassin launched himself at Mel again, and Mel saw her death coming. There was no way she could make it. Should she scream? Wait, she was already screaming. She hadn’t stopped since she started.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWExNDk0ZTczZjQzNGViNzYwYzAzNmI1NDA4NmYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, it was getting hard to think. Was she afflicted with poison?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjhmMjgyZjI0MjQ1ZGI4MmU3YzVkNGQwOTg3MzU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A loud snapping sound filled the air, and the assassin's arm froze, his dagger inches away from Mel. Someone's hand had appeared, grabbing the assassin by the wrist.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDk5YTRlYzQ4NDRhNTQ4NDE0NzFkMjVlZmU2ODY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A floating hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDNmZjQ1NDcwYjRiM2Q4Yzg5NWVkN2RkNGZmNDk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A pungent smell of burnt toast reached Mel’s nose.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzAyZTUxYmIwNTRlMzk4ZGY2ZjFhNGRlMWM1ZjY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The assassin was yanked, and with a grunt, he was pulled into…</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTBiZmRjYTg2NDRlZDRiNGU5MmY2ZGM5ZDA0NDIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothingness.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjVjMDUxYjdjYzRlZjRhM2E1MzU5ZjNiN2ZmNTky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was there, and now he was gone. Mel was suddenly alone. She forced herself to stop screaming. What in the seven hells just happened? Was she saved?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzhkMzNhMjg4MTRkMjBhMTgwMDMxNTJhN2Q5M2Mz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She needed to dress her wounds and keep her aura up. If she could keep her aura going, she could delay blood loss and poison spread. She could…</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjQyMDRhMWU4MjRlMTU5OGVmYjk0MWI1MTlmNzk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, her vision was going dark.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTE0NDhlMmVmNjQ1NjE5NDZkZGEyNWI0NmQ3Njc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Another snapping sound reached Mel’s ears, and out of nowhere, a figure bent towards her. It was not the assassin, rather a feminine figure with a grimace. She had small horns and yellow eyes. Someone from Centralis?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmFlNGVmY2ZiYzRlMjZhYWFlMmQyNWU1NjZjZmVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wearing a maid uniform.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NmFmN2IzOGMzOTRkOWY5ZTUzMDA1YzVkZTdkNTY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the…” Mel mumbled as she felt herself go weak. Whatever poison was inside her, it was acting fast.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmFlMTliZWI4YzQ1NmJhZmU4NmZjZjczNWVlZWJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She felt the figure pick her up. During her last moments of consciousness, she heard the woman who appeared from nowhere, dressed as a maid, mutter something that made no sense.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2M4ZjdiYjE3YjRlOTQ4Y2UyOTUxNWQwOWNiMWIz" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Divine One is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">definitely</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> going to be giving me a raise after this…”</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM1NzU5ODE5NzM0MDQ3MWNhMGJlYTc0YzBhNTBjNTc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTBmNTA0NDY0MjQwZDE5NDk0M2RhZjBhNTk5ZTlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena woke to the sound of hurried footsteps in the outside corridor. She immediately knew the owner of those footsteps was coming to communicate bad news. It was the same type of determined strides she’d grown familiar with from her time as a captain. On many occasions, Tomes or Dagon approached her quarters in the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the same way, always coming to inform her of a problem.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGMyNWUxZjUzNzQyZTBhN2M2NWRmZGUzMjA0Y2Rj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She elbowed Amelia. “Get dressed,” she hissed before climbing out of bed and slipping on her instructor uniform. She barely had time to fix her jacket when the footsteps stopped outside her door and the person behind it rapidly knocked. Judging from the aether signature, it was either Ryosuke or the grandmaster.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjg0MDA1NDRjMjQ0NmZhN2QwNWQxYWNkOGY4Yzg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A moment!” she called, then frowned realising it was unlikely her shout would be heard through Amelia’s sound-blocking ward. The room brightened, and she turned to see a golden glow with hints of blue fading from Amelia’s body - she had healed herself wide awake.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWFmMzcyMzgzYjRmMWZiYWU3ODA0MTZmYzdlNGQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instructor Halen?” a voice sounded from beyond the door, followed by more knocking. It turned out it was Ryosuke, after all. Serena exchanged a glance with Amelia. They were both confused and while Serena could keep her face neutral, Amelia wore her emotions on her face as if they were the latest fashion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDk3ZmVlYzc4YzRiMGI5YjNjM2RiZTc2YjJkYjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Confusion. Concern. Worry.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTE3MzRiMWYxMjRlNGZiNjVmZWUyMjdiMjg5Yzg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena left Amelia behind in the bedroom to get dressed. Exiting Amelia’s sound-blocking ward, she once again called out, “One moment!”. Thankfully, that stopped Ryosuke’s knocking. The man sounded like he was seconds away from kicking the door down. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTY3ZDM3OTlmODRkZGI5MzY4YTA2ZjAyZTBmYzJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something must have happened.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTdmZGY2NTlkMjRhODc5ODYzMWFkYzFiYjQ3NGFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena opened the door to see the Head Instructor with a tense expression. He looked her up and down before stepping through the doorframe and looking around the room. His eyes lingered on the closed bedroom door before locking onto Serena’s.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWJmNGE4Y2I5ZTQ1N2ZiMjEwNjFkOTRjNDU5Mjlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was carrying his weapon.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2ZjN2NhMGI4ZTRjOTQ5OGExZWEyYjIwNGMxMDdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is Amelia in there?” he asked. “I can sense some wards.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzE2ZTBiMDVjZDQ5MTNhNzY5NTYyOWQ1NDkzY2Q5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt her tongue twist, ready to click in annoyance. She liked and respected Ryosuke, but it didn't bode well if the coming conversation regarding her and Amelia’s relationship started so curt. She knew many of the instructors possessed quite traditional views when it came to… her disposition. She’d hoped, and still hoped, that Ryosuke, who had travelled the Empire more than she had, would be more understanding.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODRjOTBiODgyMjRlMWFhZDc5Nzk1ZmY4MjY4NzY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” she answered flatly. “What’s wrong?” As she asked the question, her mind churned. Why would Ryosuke, either by himself or under the grandmaster’s orders, storm into her room, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">armed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, in the early hours of the morning? Even if they disapproved of her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">activities</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, this wouldn’t be the time or the place for them to bring it up.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzhmYWFjODE3YTQ0YjZiMDY2OTgzM2E1MzljZGEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Has she been with you the entire night? She hasn’t left?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTU5NDIwMGFiMzRiZTY5NDZmMGNhNGQ0MDMzYzRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The latter question prompted Serena to become sure this wasn’t about the potential discovery of her relationship. “Yes,” she answered. “She was exhausted after training her aura, so I invited her to stay the night.” Serena crossed her arms. “Why? What’s going on, Ryosuke?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmZmZDdmNzY5ZjRjZjZiMTU4NGU4ZjE1M2Q4ZjEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He scratched his nose. “Is she decent? Can you fetch-” he coughed into his hand lightly. “Can you request she make herself known?” As his question finished, two more sets of footsteps could be heard, and a moment later, Ryosuke was joined by Nathaniel and Sarafina. Now, three Head Instructors were making themselves welcome in her reception area.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDM4MGExZGZjMTRlM2ZiNGI3OGY0M2QzNGY0ODJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Great. Why not invite the Empress along as well!?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWE4NmQ5YTFhMjQyMWM4OGVlM2E3N2Q4MGM5Njk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ve woken the staff,” Nathaniel said. “Aethergram sent to the Old Guard. Perimeter guards were notified. They’re on the way.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzJlMjRkNTE4YzQxMzlhZjEyYWY0NTg0ODljOTMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia here?” Sarafina intoned smoothly, nodding her head towards the bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWEwYTMyN2QzMzRkOWU4NGFhYjgwZGZjNzgxZDc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Coming!” Amelia's voice sounded from beyond the door as the sound-blocking ward dropped. The door opened, and Amelia stepped through with a nervous smile and a small wave. She was wearing her uniform and - no doubt through a dash of spellwork - had it and herself looking pristine. With how she presented, no one would believe that less than a minute ago, she’d been fast asleep in Serena’s bed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmVjM2YxNWQyNTRiN2U5N2MxYmVjMzY2ZGQxNTY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That is if she hadn’t forgotten to put on her shoes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmJmZWZiZWE3MjQwZGU4Mjg5YzcwOGE5MTU4NGJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This idiot!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjliZmRkZDFmMTRkMDc4YTZkMWU5ODYzNjBhNzc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, you three!” Amelia chirped.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDZkYTdmYzhlYjQ0NzliMzczZjdkNjEzNmM3MjZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena eyed their reactions to Amelia closely. With relief, she noted their expressions softened upon seeing Amelia. Whatever Amelia was involved in, it hadn’t caused hostile intentions to form between her and the staff.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWM5YTNhOWI3YTRjYjJhNDI0MzU0MDc1NmZlMzNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia,” Sarafina said softly. “Where were you approximately an hour ago?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTIxNDVjZmQxZDRkNmY5YjdjZTM1ZGRjOWM5ZGFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh,” Amelia rubbed the back of her neck. “Here. Sleeping.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWNhZGU1OWY0YjQ4YTU4OWZmNmJiNDQzZWIyMTVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sleeping?” Sarafina questioned. “Since when?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjZjYzljOTRhNzRjMTc4ZmYxZTljNmFmMmRkN2Ey" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…” Amelia placed a finger on her chin. “Midnight?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjA5NWRhMDZjYzRhYjQ4ZGY0NTFjOGUxY2FiYjgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You shared Instructor Halen’s quarters?” Nathaniel asked, a frown forming on his face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2JiNjRmZjNkMzRhOTk5OTQwMTNlYTE4MDI0MGRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s been helping me with my aura in the evenings and early mornings,” Amelia said, shrugging nonchalantly. “It’s easier to stay the night than walk back and forth.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTE2MGI3MDczNDQ4YmZiOTMzYTVkZGY5ZmIxZGRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you used any of your healing magic tonight?” Sarafina asked. “Especially recently?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmYzODQyY2RjMTQ2MmFiZjBkNzIxN2RhOTcyMGZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only on myself,” Amelia answered. “To wake up.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTdhMzI0YWZkZTQ4NTFiYjlkYjEzMTk2NTI2MmFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The trio of instructors threw each other glances. Ryosuke’s eyes narrowed while Nathaniel and Sarafina looked confused. Serena loudly clicked her tongue, forcing the room's attention on her. She dropped her neutral expression, allowing her growing anger to show. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjVlYWY5NzMyYjRlOGY4NThmNDI2ZWQ3ODdmMTY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enough questions,” she stated, folding her arms and tapping her foot. “I’m not accustomed to having </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">armed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speakers barge into my quarters day or night. Amelia has been with me the entire night. I state that on my honour and name. So, tell me, what the fuck’s going on?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODFlYWIwODAxODRmMzhhYmU3MDA5ZWI1MTlmZGU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, none of the three took offence to her directness. Ryosuke even bowed in apology. Straightening up, he gave one final glance towards Amelia before explaining, “Second-year Melanie Mori was found unconscious in Amelia’s quarters an hour ago. Lunaria found her after detecting an unusual amount of aether that indicated a fight.” Ryosuke raised a hand, cutting off Amelia, who’d begun to interrupt. “Miss Mori is alive and well. She’s only suffering from a small amount of aether exhaustion. Lunaria has her under a sleep spell currently. We’re interested in Amelia's whereabouts and spellwork because while Miss Mori’s clothes show signs of being attacked by a blade, her body is spotless from both injury and dirt - signs we’ve come to understand are typical of Amelia’s healing and cleaning magic.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWFmYWNiYzg3ODQ2MmU5ZDM1MDZiYjJiYjIzYzNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She was attacked!?” Amelia blurted out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDAzY2Y2ODU2ODRlYzM4MDcyNjZiNGQ3OGM2M2M1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Who</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> attacked her?” Serena asked, locking eyes with Ryosuke, demanding his attention.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTY2Y2M5OGE2YzQ2OGJhMDE1M2E3ZDczYTZhZTVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ochimusha</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Sarafina jumped in.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTRlOTEwYzY4MTRhZjY4OTIxYjJkYWI4YjRkZWRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena hissed, feeling her eyes widen with surprise. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjFhOTgxMjkxMjQxMzRhMDM0MzcxYWNhMzAyNjBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">An ochimusha!? Here!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDJkMjUwYjE2OTQ4OGI5OGFkMjNmYjA3N2M1YjYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now dead,” Sarafina continued. “His body is in Amelia’s room. Strangely, it looks like he died from aether exhaustion, which has us all puzzled. He entered through the window and certainly engaged in some kind of fight with Miss Mori. Only…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDFhMTBkOTk5NDQ0YmNiNTU4Mzg5MDFkZDljYTk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only… defeating an ochimusha would be beyond Mel,” Serena finished the sentence. The term </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ochimusha</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> referred to an honourless warrior who had fallen into a dishonest and criminal lifestyle. They were assassins, thieves, and pirates. Above all, they were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">dangerous</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Beyond the capabilities of an average trainee officer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjkyZWI1NTUxMDRhMDM5YTUzN2YzZGYzNTM3OWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” Ryosuke affirmed. “Judging by the symptoms of aether exhaustion, Lunaria reckons the man’s aura bordered on yellow, if not already there. Miss Mori was verging on orange - not a close match. Her aura wouldn’t have protected her against his attacks, and his weapons looked poisoned. As I said, Miss Mori’s body is unharmed, but her clothes carry the signs of being subject to cuts and stabs.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzA0ZTg0N2UwNDQ3NDFhNmJjYTAxMzk0ZTljZWY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Simultaneously, all three instructors turned towards Amelia. The unspoken implication lay heavy in the air. Although Serena was confident Amelia hadn’t left her sight or arms for even a minute tonight, she couldn’t help but raise a questioning eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWUwYjgzNmU3NDQxZDFiZWFhNTRjZTk0MGJkODM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t look at me,” Amelia crossed her arms and tapped her bare feet. “It wasn’t me, and if it was, I wouldn’t try and hide it! Mel’s okay, then? I’ll go and visit her!” She took a step towards the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzYyYTNjM2YzYjQ5Y2ViNTBiMzFiZTc1MmE3N2Jl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You should stay here for now,” Ryosuke said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTNmMWFlODE4MjRhMDA4YzY2ZjY5M2ViMjAzYmM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh?” Amelia’s tone darkened. “I don’t remember </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">asking</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. If you think any of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> are going to keep me from visiting an unconscious </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">friend,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> then I suggest you think again! Hmph!” She put her hands on her hips and gave the group a half-decent glare. Had she been practising?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGI3Y2NmMjEwMzQ2MDg5MDg2MTdmNjBkNzRhMjMz" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryosuke’s jaw clenched, but Sarafina’s giggle quickly lightened the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjU1M2U5OTA0MzRiMzFiMGE4ZmMwMjkxNzNlNGJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shawa</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> has some claws, hasn’t she, Ryosuke?” Sarafina intoned. “No one here has any legal right to restrict your movements, dear Amelia, nor would we want to. With an ochimusha lying dead in your quarters with you unaccounted for, finding and protecting you - the obvious target - is a priority. Who knows if whoever sent that assassin sent others?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjRkZWE5OGQ3NjQyOTBiODliOTU4ZDAwM2NiMWRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This happened an hour ago?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDc1YTQxMThhODQ0NGU4ODc0OGM4N2Y3YjVjODU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzJmNDU4YTEyZjQyM2NiODFkNGFhNzU1MWFiZTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And it took you an hour to come here?” It didn’t quite add up. If Amelia was determined to be the primary target of a potential assassin, Serena should have been woken up long ago.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTQ2ZGRmMzY2NTQ3ZDhiYTEwNzM3NTM3YWNhMzVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, after Lunaria secured Amelia’s quarters, she became so interested in the residue aether that she forgot to raise the alarm. Something about the fight caught her attention.” Sarafina shrugged. “She isn’t called the Aether Addict for nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmY2NjIxNzdlYTQ2MjVhZmY3NjcwMTQ0YzQxY2Mz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right. There was more than one type of idiot in the academy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzUyOTU5M2NlOTRlMmU5M2IzZmFiMGY3ODBhM2E5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about the students?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDdjZTY0YWM1NDRhZmFiYjA5NDAxNmEzNTE5M2Uz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Conducting head counts as we speak,” Nathaniel offered. “Got half the staff searching the buildings and grounds. No one has sensed any unusual aether activity and you two are fine, so it looks like a single assassin. We’re trying to keep things quiet, for now at least.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjAxMzAzMjIwNzQ1Zjc5MzRlZTBlNjBjMTYzNjJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not the kind of thing we can just sweep under the rug,” Serena said. An ochimusha trying to assassinate a now famous staff member of a prestigious academy would inevitably leak, no matter how hard the grandmaster or Greatlord Oshiro wanted to keep it down.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWYyODUwYzZjOTRhYjI4OTFkNmQ1NmQxZjQ2NjQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Nathaniel said. “We’ve sent an aethergram to the Old Guard. Officially reported it. They’ll likely be turning up within the hour.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmZiNmI1MjdkMzQ0NDZhNjllYzU1YmUyZGQxMTVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryosuke chuckled, now appearing more relaxed. “Old Oshiro’s probably going to be woken up over this. He might come down himself. Can you imagine the argument if he and the Grandmaster get into a shouting match? Bet they’re going to blame each other for this.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWY1Mzk4NTRmNTRiODI5NTBiNGRkNDg0MDJhMmU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of,” Serena pointed out. “Has the Grandmaster been notified?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjE3ZDllNzI5YTRkMmZiNTY1YWJlOWIxNGViNWU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Nathaniel said. “He’s at the scene.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2QxMDQ3NDkwNjRiMTU5OWI2NzBjZjdmZjUwZTBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena could see Amelia was practically hopping between her feet. Despite the seriousness of the situation, it was quite adorable. The woman was determined to go and see Mel but also desperately held herself back so as not to cause any further problems.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmNkNWUxNzMxYzRkMTc5MzFlY2VhN2RjNWQ2NTQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s head there together,” Serena said. “Amelia, put some shoes on.” She turned to the three instructors as Amelia vanished into the bedroom. “The best place to protect Amelia is the place that’s next to Lunaria and the Grandmaster,” she explained. Not only that but on the unlikely chance the assassin had been contracted to kill Mel, then the safest place for Mel would be near Amelia.</span></p><span class="cjFlNGU1NmJlZjRkYjQ3MjlhMjZiOTIwOGY1ZjI2NzAy"><br/>If you spot this narrative on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM3OTliZmRhNTM2YjRjYWZhMjMyNjMyZTQ3ZGVkODZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As they walked through the main building, Serena was occupied with one burning question: Who would be stupid enough to try and kill Amelia with an assassin capable of only yellow aura? Amelia was a known Speaker, and anyone with any talent who’d spent enough time around her would get some sense of the dense layers of wards she always kept up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDA2NDIyYTk1ZTQxZTJhZDgwYmJhMGEzYWQ0MzM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They exited the main building and began walking the pathway to the magic tower. Throughout the grounds, pairs of guards and other staff carried aetherlights as they scoured the area for anything unusual. If another assassin were somewhere, they would undoubtedly abandon any further action. With the entire academy now alert, it would be suicidal to try anything.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWE3YjI2MTEzNzRiNTRhMzMwNDMwMzIyMWRiYzM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Entering the magic tower, they travelled nearly to the top, stepping off on the floor where Amelia’s quarters were located. There, Kenji Tanaka and a handful of other staff stood guard. As they passed, Ryosuke whispered, “How is he?” and Kenji made an expression that read </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">tread-lightly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2JiOWJlNWY5ZjRjY2ZhZDQ4ZTVmYTc5ZmZlMzdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Stepping inside, Serena realised this was the first time she’d ever been in Amelia’s quarters. She couldn’t help but note that Amelia had gotten better amenities than she had. What kind of favouritism was Lunaria operating on?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzA3N2M4ZGJmYTQ2ZDk5Y2NkMTgxNGEwMDU3NDlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman in question, the Head of the Department of Aether, was sitting in a chair, buzzing with aether. Casting her perception around, Serena identified layers of privacy wards surrounding the room. Lunaria was also maintaining a sleep spell over the unconscious Mel, who was lying on a table with a folded blanket slotted underneath her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2QxODVlY2MyYjRkNmZhNmVhODNlZjEzZWU1MDhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She sensed the aether signature of the grandmaster from Amelia’s bedroom. Presumably, that was where the body of the would-be assassin was. For now, Serena would focus on Mel, who was being looked over by Emalina Honda, the Head of Medical and Battlefield Care. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWE4ZDczZWYwZjQ1MTg4NzkxYmZkZDVhMmQ4N2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia rushed past, bouncing up to the sleeping Mel. Her movement caused Emalina to turn and ask pointedly, “Did you heal her? She’s in perfect condition, other than a dash of aether exhaustion, which doesn’t look like the result of anything more than a slightly intense training session.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWViNTBkMDZmNDRjNjk5M2FiM2VmMDZkZGQ0NmJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia shook her head. Serena added, “I can vouch it wasn’t her”. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDg3ZWZkOWQ3ZTQ2ZWRiMjA1NDY5YzM2NWUxYWFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Emalina looked between the two before turning to look at Ryosuke, who nodded back. The demon sighed, saying, “Well, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">someone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> healed this girl!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjRhZThlYmE4MDRmMmViMWRhNjYwNjMzNTlmMTFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure she was healed?” Serena asked. She had to be honest, Mel did look, well, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ameliafied</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She had that clean, healthy look that Serena was now used to seeing in the mirror after Amelia had cast her healing and cleaning spells on her. Serena turned and asked Lunaria, “Did you detect any healing magic?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTQ1OGVlNTM5NjQ5MmRiMmJmMzI0NWVhM2RkMzli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Admittedly, no,” answered the Head Instructor. “But I felt the aether signatures of two warriors fighting. They fought, and somehow, this one…” Lunaria gestured towards Mel’s sleeping figure. “...Won.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDU1YjgwYmRjODQxYzRiY2I2MTRjODU1NTdiNzJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look here,” Emalina said, prompting Amelia’s and Serena’s attention as she turned Mel to the side. “Stab wounds in the shoulder here and here,” she finished by pointing towards the slit in the clothes around Mel’s lower back. “She was struck by an aura-enhanced blade in the stomach; you can see where the fibres have darkened slightly from the heat.” Emalina then motioned towards Mel’s left leg, where there was large cut in the clothes covering her lower leg. “Same thing here,” Emalina explained. “Only, look how deep the cut would have had to be to cut the clothes like this. The intruder nearly took her entire leg off!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGZjYmRlNGU4OTRkYzU4N2U1MDRjMzViNDFiNGY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But she’s been healed,” Serena muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGJjNmYyNWExMTQ5NjQ5NTg3NDViOTNjZmE3MjI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">And</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> cleaned,” Emalina pointed out. “She hasn’t got a drop of blood on her or her clothes, but the body of the intruder </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">does</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> have her blood on it. At least, we think it’s Miss Mori’s blood. We’ll have to send it for testing first and see if the blood types differ.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTdiNDgwNzIwNTRjNjU5NmVmYjgzMjdmYTZlNGIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kinds of injuries has the ochimusha got?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmEzMjNkZjMwYjRmMTM5YmE1MmIwZTllNGYxYmQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“None that produce blood,” Emalina said with a shrug. “I’ll have to do an autopsy to be sure, but I’ll need permission from the Old Guard first. I’ve only examined him briefly, but it looks like he died from pure aether exhaustion, which doesn’t make much sense.” Emaline nodded her head in the direction of the bedroom. “Doesn’t look like some great fight went on, so how did </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">he</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> die of exhaustion?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWQ1OGQyZGRjMzRjMzlhOTgzMzNkYThlY2Q0NzI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena couldn’t help but agree. If the assassin was engaged in a conflict that taxed him to the point of dying from aether exhaustion, then the room should show signs of an intense battle - collapsed walls and the like. From what she could see, that didn’t fit the physical evidence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2U3MDUzMGVjMzQwZTNhYzAwYjM3MWZmMDg1MWE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This healing…” Amelia spoke up. She’d been watching Mel quietly with a solemn expression for a while, but now she seemed to have found her voice again. “Perhaps the assassin fought with the same person who healed Mel? And that person overwhelmed him so much he died from aether exhaustion?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWYzMzdjZTM3ZDQ4YjI5NmRmZjRlNDA5NjRhMWY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assuming it wasn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Emalina said. “Not that I don’t believe you, of course,” she added quickly, seeing Serena’s glare. “Lunaria didn’t detect that level of fighting, did you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjBiZjAwZTc2OTQxOTlhZDgxMzdjNzczZmZjMThl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Lunaria added, shaking her head. “Which means another healer, one that is certainly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and likely with extensive cloaking capabilities good enough to fool me, was somehow involved and came to Miss Mori’s aid. It would have to have been a very talented Speaker. Perhaps a dual-Speaker with a focus on </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaxai</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> or similar.” She chewed the tip of her thumb before turning to Amelia. “You swear true? That this was not you? You would not be in any trouble, either with us or the law, if you killed this man.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGY2YThiMGI0ZDQ5ZWJiMTg5ZTNhNjZkOTYxNDNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I swear!” Amelia puffed her chest out. “On my name </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> honour! I was asleep the entire night! In Serena’s-” Amelia coughed quickly. “-Quarters.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmNhYTVkNGQ1ODQzNzY5OGY2NTZkNzM4MDYwYzYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh?” Lunaria raised an inquisitive eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTA3MTUwMjk0MjQ5MGE5MzY2MDQ2ZDI1NDhhMTNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Resisting a sigh, Serena explained she was helping Amelia train in the evenings and early mornings and how she would invite her to stay to save walking back and forth between the main building and the magic tower. It wasn’t technically a lie; it would pass the test of an axiom crystal. It just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">slightly </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">avoided what they got up to</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> between</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> those two training periods.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTcwMDUwZTY5MDQ2MWJiNDczMDVlODU1NjBjNzYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena was sure that once things had settled down, some of the instructors might begin to construct… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">theories,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> especially the three who had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">seen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia exit Serena’s bedroom barefoot. For now, at least, they had bigger fish to catch.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTVhNWRkYzEwZjRlZmFhY2Q4ZDcxOWEzN2JlMjQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In that case…” Lunaria murmured. “I’ll keep my thoughts to myself. I fear if I vocalise the few theories I have that fit with the facts, you’ll cart me off to the asylum for madness. Ha!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjUxZDk4ZWJhNjQzMGViYWIyY2FjYWMwNzM1ODcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This prompted a few titters from the instructors in the room, but in their eyes, Serena could see they were having similar thoughts. Where could she even begin with this? As far as she knew, the nearest human healer that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wasn’t</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia was thousands of klicks away on the human continent! To the best of her knowledge, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">only</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> human healer both friendly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> powerful enough to do what was described, was already here in this room! And that healer was adamant it wasn’t her!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjI1ZGY4YTY4YTQwODI4YmZiNjhmYjMyMGEwNTA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it have been a demon? As the thought formed, Serena was already pushing it out of her head. Demonkind had no gods of healing, and no demon has ever communed with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Neither had any demon ever developed enough communion to form even the first-circle healing spells.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Mjc4NjhlMmYzNzRjYmU4YjgyYzk3NjUyZjQzNWRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The worst part was that Serena </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">knew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia wasn’t lying. She had known the woman long enough to understand how difficult it was for her to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lie</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> about anything. It was both a blessing and a curse and that especially held true tonight. It was a blessing to have Amelia not be involved, and also a curse that she wasn’t because it meant there was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">someone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">else</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> with powerful healing abilities that could hide themselves from Lunaria’s perception.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjE2MjA2MzhkNDQyZmQ5OTM4YjlkNWUxODM0ODUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Had another ridiculous existence like Amelia popped up? Was there another powerful healer somehow friendly to demonkind? Was there some kind of hidden talent that Centralis Intelligent had pulled out?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTA1ZWMwNjFkYTQ3NGZiYTAxMjdjOWM0NDIwOWFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to check on the other body,” Serena said, turning to Amelia. “Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzMzMGQxMTk5YTQ0YjFiYTVmMTFjYmQxMGJhZjQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded, although with forced enthusiasm. “I’m happy to see Mel’s okay!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjA0ZDYzMjJkYjRlOTBiNWU4YjcwNjFiOWU3ZDQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can heal her when we wake her up,” Lunaria intoned from her chair. “Not that she needs it, as you can tell. Just don’t do it now - the feeling of aether exhaustion might help her remember the fight.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzcwYzhkMmRiOTQxYzM4MjBjYmMyODIzZDQ5ZTMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Back soon,” Serena declared, standing up. Nathaniel left the room while Ryosuke and Sarafina were going over some papers. Judging by their comments, it was the results of the student headcounts and searches. “Anything unusual?” she asked as she passed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGYxNWQ5MWU3MzQ2NjY4MjUzNTU0NTc0NTIzN2Nm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They both shook their heads.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjc2ZjU3MzEwODRmMzNhMmExMDliNTBhMTI5MTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena stepped into Amelia’s bedroom. It was well-lit; the aetherlights had been turned up fully. Lying </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">on</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia’s bed was the corpse of the ochimusha. Standing against one wall was the grandmaster. He was watching the dead body with cold eyes, almost as unmoving as the corpse on the bed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjM4OTQwZWFhMzRmNDk4M2EyNzFiZjNkNGE3ZDhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She gave the dead ochimusha a look over. He was an assassin, alright. He wore dark, well-fitted clothing so it wouldn’t catch on any thorns or brambles. He wore no shoes; his aura would have protected him against anything he could step on, so he would have favoured the extra feedback through his bare feet. His weapon of choice was a steel knife, its deadly blade now lying harmless next to him. There was blood on the blade, as well as something else. Serena leaned closer to examine it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODgxYjUzNmE2NzRiZWI5MGNmNzFiZDVhMGM4NDQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Poison,” the grandmaster growled. “Careful.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjQyNzdhMDUwMjQ0MzY4MDYxZDFkNmE4Yzc2ODkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Serena nodded. She could see the sticky resin coat. If this was the blade that cut Mel, then it was even more evidence she was covertly saved and healed. Furthermore, Serena wasn’t an expert tracker or hunter, but she knew enough to determine that the ochimusha’s placement on Amelia’s bed wasn’t congruent with Mel’s blood trail. Someone had placed him here after he was dead.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTI4MWViYjIwYzRjMWViMDI4ZTgzZWJjOGRhZjRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Manwese,” the grandmaster stated. “Perhaps from Tanhae, judging by the base of his horns. No one here recognises him, so he probably isn’t named. Once the Old Guard get here, I’ll get copies of the photographs they take and see if anyone in my brother’s circle knows who this is.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2U2ZDZlODJlMjQ3ODNhYzhiZWU5ODAzNzNmYTlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re passing the investigation onto them, then?” Serena asked. Considering the Speakers involved and the fact the crime happened on the grounds of what was technically a military establishment, the grandmaster had the authority to take charge himself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGYzODIwYWE5ZDRlNGRhZmUxOGM3ODA2NjExZWM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, we’ll do our investigation, but on paper, it’ll be them,” he said, raising a fist and squeezing it tight. “The Old Guard handle the perimeter security, which means </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">this </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">bastard slipped through </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">their </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">net. I’ll bring the seven hells onto them for this failure.” His eyes darkened and somehow became even more cold. “If the girl had died, I would’ve taken their heads.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWE4MGIzMjE4ZTQ1YjhhZjg4ZDI0NTgyYzY0Yjky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He wasn’t joking.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGRiOGQ4ZTI4MTRmODRiOTRjNjBjMGQzMGVjNzBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do we know it was the window?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjA4NDI1NWU1NjQ0YTVhYjZjMzRjNTVjYWY0ZDky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm,” came the grumbled response. “Lockpicking marks on the lock.” The grandmaster finally moved, walking past Serena and closing the door. A burst of aether erupted from Lunaria, and Serena experienced the now-familiar sensation of being in a room wrapped in a sound-blocking spell. Now, it was just the pair of them. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGUzYzJhNmEyMjRlYjE4ZTYxN2ZlYjY4YTcwMWYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And a corpse.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTUxZjQxM2RjYjRmZmY5MjQ3ZmIxZjg2OTRhYTgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instructor Halen,” he intoned, his presence filling the entire room. “Do you know anything about this? Is this Thornheart’s work?” He glared at her, and Serena could swear she felt herself shrinking under his gaze. She thought she had a weighty stare, but this was something else.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWM1OGIzNTA4OTQ2OWI4NmZkNDExYTgzZWU3MDIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” she answered. “It’s not. I know this.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmVhNDQwNjFmNjQ4MjBhMzhmNTEzMzljMTAxZmI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How do you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">know</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzExNzJmNmRkMzQzMGM4MTUyMzQ2ZjNmYjhkMTFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">know </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">her. I know when she’s lying, and she’s not lying. She’d testify to this under an axiom crystal, as would I.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGVmN2Q0ZTAwYzQ4MDVhYTU2YTg1NmNiNzNiOTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” the grandmaster rubbed his chin. The pressure in the room eased. “Know any likely suspects? People with the means and motive to order this?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Nzk1Yjg1OGM5NDRmOWY4NGY4Mzc3N2E2MjYyMDBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Any high-ranking member of the human clergy?” Serena offered with a shrug. “A Northern fanatic? This could be the work of a hundred different organisations. The list of possible suspects might be thousands. To be honest…” She sighed. “I thought something like this might have happened sooner rather than later.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmExNmUxNDdlZTQzYmU4MThjODZlMTIxZWYxNzY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The grandmaster took a moment to reply. “This doesn’t feel like a particularly sophisticated attempt. An honourless warrior against a Speaker? Madness. Madness and stupidity.” He shook his head. “Human groups wouldn’t waste an ochimusha on a half-hearted attempt like this. This came from a demon, but that hardly narrows the list.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjQ3MmM4NzU0MDQzYjg4OWI0Nzc1M2FiM2MxOGNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe…” It was worth a shot. “Darkblades?” Serena suggested. “They’re both mad </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> stupid.” Even as she said it, she didn’t really believe it. She fully expected that, at some point, the Darkblades would try and assassinate Amelia. They’d had more than a few discussions around the subject. But this? It felt sloppy. Amateurish. Like some spoilt rich boy had thrown money at a problem he had no idea-</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yzk2YTM4MGEyMzRhMjVhZTkwNGY5OTkyYjIwYjc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWQxMjhhYmY5NDRjNmJiYmZmOGMwMGM1MWQ0MzMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There… is one person,” Serena tentatively began, a memory from her time in Kenhoro slowly surfacing. “A Lord-Prospect </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Jin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I never found out his first name. He was a snarky, stuck-up brat with too much money who would never be sanctioned with full lordship but still liked his friends calling him </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. That kind of man. I, Amelia, and an intelligence officer called Aiden Adachi encountered him in a Kenhoro restaurant for the moonrain festival.” She placed a finger to her temple, closing her eyes, trying to remember the events. It was tricky - she’d been drunk at the time.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDUwODc1ZjBjMTRmNTJhYTlhZjJjODQyZGNiOTQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He was a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sixhorn</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Three pairs. Long braided dark hair. He had a group with him. Four to six people. Similar appearance less the horns. He pulled his sword against Amelia. I stepped in and gave them all a beating.” Serena decided she wouldn’t mention that the primary motivation for her actions was Amelia’s promise that if she could get them all unconscious within five seconds, she would agree to anything Serena requested when they were alone in bed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTZjMzc3MjU1YzQzNzRhZTRmMzQ4N2FjMDg1ZjU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d greatly profited from that deal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTUxNDBlMWVmMjRlMTdhYWJmMjA4ZGJmYjk2ZmZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s probably more than a dozen </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect Jins</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> walking about Kenhoro and Tanhae…” The grandmaster took a slow breath. “But not a lot of sixhorns. My brother would know who that is. You think this Lord-Prospect Jin is the type?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMThlOWI1YTRhMzRiZDZhYzcxYmM1MDBiMDNjYzdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For this?” Serena gestured towards the corpse. “Young, brash, stupid… unable to drop a grudge, too scared to get revenge against House Halen directly, so he blames everything on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">… it’s possible. At the very least, the stupidity fits.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDdiYmM4MzQ2OTRhNGY5MGViZmU4M2JjZjQ5YWYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stupid indeed. He’ll hang for this.” He nodded towards the door. “I’d like to bring Thornheart in to discuss this incident. Then, we’ll wake the girl up and see what she remembers. When the Old Guard come and make a mess of everything, don’t mention this Lord-Prospect in any statements. We’ll ask Thornheart to do the same.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzczOWFlZGYyNjQwNGZhNTdlMjNhMTI0MzNmMTE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re that incompetent?” Serena asked. She knew there was some bad blood between the Old Guard and the military, but didn’t know it extended all the way up towards figures as important as the grandmaster.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTM5ODdlZDQ5OTQ0NzhiM2FmZWQxN2VkZjRjMGZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The demon shook his head. “It’s not so much as incompetence; rather, the hacks have so many contacts on the inside they’ll end up leaking everything, whether intentionally or accidentally. We’ll do our own investigation before this Lord-Prospect finds out he’s a suspect from a broadsheet headline.” He faced Serena. “It’ll be a long night. They love taking photographs of everything and speaking to everyone multiple times. I also need you to complete an incident report for military records.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDRjNmRiYzg3NTRiOThhYjE4MTZkZTEwYzVmN2Ux" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right. Of course. Paperwork. Serena’s time in the military had caused her to learn there were three things guaranteed in life: death, taxes, and the inordinate amount of paperwork you had to fill out when anything interesting happened.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTEzYjMzMjU4MjQ1YTM5NjY3NmQwNjYzMjUyMWY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Letting a small sigh escape, she joined the grandmaster in returning to the reception room, where a long night awaited them.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3ZDYzYzE2YTMxODQ2NzI4MWNhODI5MTM2NDNmNzM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Noburu POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/noburu.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWRmNjEzYjk2MzQxOTJiZjM0MmUyOGJhNjhiNWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The workspace the academy prepared for them was a small room through an unassuming door on the lower floor, away from the main throughway. Once, Noburu thought it might have been a classroom, judging from the inset part of the wall where a large blackboard would have fitted. They were told it had been a nearly forgotten storage room for years until it was hastily tidied and cleaned pending their arrival. The assorted furniture and boxes were piled against one side, and a large table was set up in the remaining space for their work.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjYyNjU2ZTRjMzQyNGQ4ZTM1ZTM2MDg3ODhmOTY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hardly the most modern workshop.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzlmNDIyYjMwODQwZDg4NGJmZDMxMjM5NTA4MjRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few armour sets stood on the table, propped up by their wooden stands. Lying alongside them were half a dozen swords and a few spearheads. Noburu and Seonmi pretended to expertly examine the artefacts while the staff member assigned to show them around watched with mild interest. The demon, a man named Takumi, who didn’t feel like much of a warrior, served as the academy's archivist.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGRmOGIzOWMxNzQ0ZjFiNDYxOTJlYWMwNDk3NmFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm,” Noburu mumbled, peering through a magnifying glass at the dry, cracked leather.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWY0YjhiZDY4NTRkOWJiNWUzNzQwZDU5NDQ1NTY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” Seonmi added as she examined the metal clasps.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjcyZjIxMDQ2ZTQ2Y2FhMWFjYjVlYTVlNjljNmY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They shook their heads, looked at each other, and then shook their heads again with an additional sigh. Their performance had the intended effect, earning them a face of worry from Takumi.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzI5NjViOGRiZjRkNDY4Njg5OWEwNzZkZDMzZGU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That doesn’t sound good,” the archivist said with a frown.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzQwNWVjOWY3MjRlNmY4NmFjOGM4OGIzMWRmZWZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could be worse,” Noburu said, straightening up. “We’re lucky this brigandine was kept in a box with a support structure. It also helps the leather is rannar rather than cattle. The former is far more resistant to deterioration. That said, we’re not starting with the best pair of dice; maintenance work should’ve started earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTcyMDZkN2Q0NTRkZTJiNGVkMDQzYTljYTYyY2Rk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How much earlier?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODdkYTVlNDBiODQwMWFhNWRkYjExYjM5ZjIyZTk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu glanced at the plaque at the base of the armour stand. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Samino Brigandine. War of the Ten Houses. 520 A.V</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. “About three centuries ago,” he declared. “I can make the leather presentable, depending on how much I can interfere. I can clean it using dry methods and then use a humidifying chamber to bring some life back into it, but if you want it looking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fresh,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it’ll need treatment with conditioners.” He turned to Seonmi, making sure to use her false name. “How’s the metal, Yunseo?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzc0MDUwOTdjOTQ0MTQ5ZTdkODBjNTZlNmJlMTRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Severe rusting on the internal plates,” Seonmi replied, gesturing towards the armour. “Some of the rivets are barely holding on. We can sandblast the larger pieces, but the rivets are unlikely to survive. We could use an acid bath, but that carries the risk of weakening the metal through hydrogen embrittlement. Hmm…” She placed a hand on her chin. “It would be best to replace them entirely. You mentioned that you have a large number of examples from the War of the Ten Houses?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDNiY2QwOTA4ZjQzNDc5OTBjZTlkZmRkOWZhN2Iy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Takumi nod, Seonmi continued, “Then, as much as it pains me to cannibalise the past, if you want to keep things authentic, then we’d best salvage some stronger rivets from the old pieces that are beyond restoration. If we could get permission to open up more boxes and see what’s there, I think we’ll be able to find a proper replacement.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjdlZjg2NzVjMzRjYmU4M2JhMWIyZmRlYTFkZTY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I can ask,” Takumi replied. “What about the weapons?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDg1Yzk2OGVmMDRiMzdhMDhhMDczMTE0MzdjMDc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seonmi peered at the series of blades laid out on the table. “Typical amounts of corrosion. Varying levels of pitting. See here? We can clean it up, but without filler material, it will never look great.” She pointed towards the handle of one of the weapons. “See this grey? The silver decorations have tarnished. It’s not corrosive, but we’ll need to be careful polishing it. The goal will be to bring back the previous lustre without removing too much material.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTc3YzkyOThlYjQyOTM4Nzg0YTY1ZWJjYTk5Y2Ix" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noboru could tell Seonmi was having fun in her role as Yunseo Yoo-jung, the metal specialist. She was a natural-born actress, and Noburu never understood why she didn’t use her charm and talents to join a travelling troupe. She could get out of the slums, travel the Empire and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">explore</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. As far as he knew, she didn’t have any obligations like he did with Kiku and the kids. So, why didn’t she leave? Perhaps she was hiding from something or someone.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjA0YjZkNWQ5NDQ4MWQ5NjZlNmI0N2I3MDczNTQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Either way, it wasn’t his business.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDlhNjBjNWFiMzRlN2M5MzU4MmFhMjMxZWZiMDA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How long will your work take?” Takumi asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGEyZjI4NmMwMjRiYjI4Zjk3ZWY5OTY2ODJhOTgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re contracted for the completion of these pieces' restoration, not for any deadline.” Seonmi looked upwards as if doing mental arithmetic. “We’ll likely spend a few working days just building a plan of attack. Once you start removing material, you can’t go back. Like a sculptor, we must be sure before we begin. Let’s say… two or three days for the preparation work and then two or three weeks for the actual work. It might be longer as we’ll need to bring in specialised equipment, as you’ve told us all work must be done on-site.” Seonmi’s voice took on a note of calculated annoyance. “I’m not accustomed to working while being </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">guarded</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjZmM2UxODEyOTQ0NTk4NmQ3NDFjZmI2OTI2YTgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When they’d arrived that morning, Noburu noticed the academy seemed to be in an unusual state of heightened security. There were far more patrols and standing guards than Yoshiro’s information had suggested. He didn’t miss how the students would glance at these guards with raised eyebrows while they whispered about the new changes. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2JmZDcyMzFhMDQ2NzhhYzg4ODMxZGM1M2JhYzE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only that, but he saw a few men wearing the uniform of Old Guard investigators. They were striding around the grounds, taking notes and photographs with their large crystal-fuelled steam cameras. Their presence had caused a slight tinge of worry to form in Noburu’s stomach, which he quickly crushed down. They weren’t here for him or Seonmi. Something else had happened.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmRiYzA4MzZhOTQyOTM4YmY1MmZiMmNhODE2MDVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When they signed in to the academy's visitor book, they were told by Takumi that, due to a recent </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">incident</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, they would need to be accompanied at all times. They would even be led to and from the latrine should they desire to use it. Once they arrived at the workshop, a guard had been waiting at the doorway. Seonmi protested the situation, making Takumi apologetic. After all, she was the talented Yunseo Yoo-Jung, the Fengra expert who had travelled all this way only to be treated like a common criminal!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2Y3NjAyMjcyNzQ4MTdiY2I0YzZiMjVmYzZjMGU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which she was, of course.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGEwYzJjNjQ0OTRlMjY4NDkxNGE2ZDFkZWIwNGUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It should only be temporary,” Takumi explained after Seonmi’s latest outburst. “In a few days, things should have calmed down.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWEwODgyZTRmODQ4NmY5YTY4ZjkyYmMyN2M3MDkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">In a few days, we’ll be gone,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Noburu thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWUyYmQwMGM3ZjQ0OWU5NmU0YTQwODdiNjJkOGFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But please understand, this is a military institution and cannot have contractors walking about as they please,” Takumi added. “There’s a war on, and there’s always a risk of distrustful individuals…” As Takumi emphasised his point, Noburu didn’t miss the man's eyes darting to his left hand where two fingers were missing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjA0YTY5ODFlYjRmMTlhZmQwOWRhYTgxZWM1OWQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was best to take the chance to address his hand now instead of hiding it and letting Takumi’s thoughts fester into something more.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2U2ZDdiMTFiMTQ5NzM5Y2MzZDkxN2YxODc3N2Jj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chisel,” Noboru stated, holding his left hand up. “When I apprenticed as a woodworker. One moment, I was smoothing out a joint, and the next, I’m looking at two bloody fingers lying on the floor.” He grimaced, shaking his head. “Learned a lesson that day; tools can be as deadly and as sharp as any weapon.” He chuckled at the imaginary memory. “Expensive lesson.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjQ0OGM1NzhkZTQxZDJhNzM0NjgxMGZhN2IyYWU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Any suspicion in Takumi’s face evaporated. “Once or twice a semester, an overly enthusiastic student gets cut. Leaves a nasty scar. Told the screams are horrible.” He shook his head. “Then again, they are being trained to wage war. Some of the highborn students we get from Centralis seem to think it's all a game…” Takumi coughed quietly. “Excuse me. I shouldn’t ramble.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTM3ZTQyZTEwNzQ2OGJiN2FjZDlhMzYxZWY0ZGY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As much as I enjoy listening to men talk about injuries,” Seonmi intoned sarcastically. “Takumi, could you please enquire as to whether we have permission to salvage rivets from storage? We’d only take from pieces that have degraded beyond any reasonable possibility of restoration. Also, please request permission for us to bring in larger equipment and chemicals for the acid baths and humidifying chambers.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzA1MTdkZTkwYzRkZDI4YTQ2ZDJlNzhkNTQ5NzFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They didn’t have access to that equipment, but Takumi didn’t need to know that. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWZhODI0ZDFmNjQ0ZDI4NGM3MzY2NmUxMTkzMGRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Forgive Yunseo,” Noburu said with a smile. “She becomes a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shawa</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> if you get in the way of her work. She’d argue with a Highlord until the moons fall.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTJiOWUwMjE5NjQ0ZDY5NGY4ZmIyM2QxZmU2N2Ni" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He continued to joke and build rapport with the archivist. If someone enjoyed your company, then manipulating them became easy. All they needed to do was fool the man long enough to identify their target in the academy's storage and make copies of any keys they needed. Then, all Noburu needed to do was slip in and out one night.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDBhZjk5NTQwOTQzMDdiMGQyZTk5NzUyOWViYTMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, Kiku. Soon, I’ll give us all a better life.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyYjYxMzI3NTAyODRkMGRiN2Q4OTNkYmE3MmExZmIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NWQ2ZjBkMmQ4ZTQwNDRiN2QyYTUzNGNkMWNjY2Zh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNjMGQ4NmRmMDUwOTQ2YTI4OGMzY2Y1ZmIyODY0MDk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia felt awful.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTQ5OGZiNjZiYTRiNTNiNWEyMGJhYzZkZjY0YWMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, Mel was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fine</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She had no injuries, and mentally, she seemed okay with what had happened. If anything, the woman seemed even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">more </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">motivated to train.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Mzg4ZGY5MWFkMzQ0MmI5ODM2NTcwNGU5YTA4OGRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But that wasn’t how Amelia felt.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDQ4ODZmZGY0YjRhNGU4MjA3YWEwOTUxMmVjMjBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The would-be assassin was more than likely after </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Mel had just been unfortunate enough to interrupt the ochimusha as he infiltrated Amelia’s quarters. Judging from the man's equipment and his apparent aura level, he would have been no threat to Amelia or even Serena. Should the ochimusha have tried to plunge his dagger into her sleeping body, it would’ve just bent or shattered against her wards.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODY0MThlODYxMTQ3NDliOTY3YWY3ZmEwZjNjMGIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But not Mel. Against Mel, that dagger had sliced and diced the poor woman - Amelia’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">friend</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. If Amelia hadn’t been sneaking off to have fun with her girlfriend, she would’ve been there to give the assassin a very rude awakening. She </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">should’ve</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> been there. If Amelia had taken her situation more seriously, Mel wouldn’t have been so close to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">dying</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTAxYzUwOGU1ZDRjNzZiYjc0NmNlYzZmOGVjMThk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her friend almost died!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWVkNzA5MWU0MTRjZmFiYmY3ZDNmYzhkYWI0NzE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If it hadn’t been for this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">mysterious healer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, about whom Amelia had her own theories that she was keeping close to her chest, Mel </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">would have died</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The thought made Amelia experience an odd mix of guilt and anger. In the end, it was basically </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">luck</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that prevented the worst-case scenario from appearing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGYxZjkwYTkxYjQ1ZjE5MDhjNDc2MjNjZTg1ZDVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She had to do better.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWRhMWVjNGRhNTQ4OGY5NjQxM2MxM2I1MWZlODlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Where she’d once been fearful of her powers, she now had become so comfortable that her perception of what was and wasn’t a threat was becoming skewed. Whether she tripped and fell off the Asamaywa plateau, some wild beast attacked her, or a battleship turned its mighty guns against her, Amelia instinctively knew she would be okay. In fact, she’d begun to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">enjoy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her sense of power. </span></p><span class="cmYzZDNmMDRkNTZiOTQ0NmY4NDM5YjAyYWYzOTE5YWE1"><br/>Unlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMwZjA5MjMxZjRkNTQ0M2ZiYTAxOWJkYTE0ZTFjM2Jk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it turned out that being powerful didn’t automatically mean harm couldn’t be dealt to those around her. Amelia couldn’t ward </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">everyone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Her aether capacity was tremendous, but she still had a finite amount of formations she could maintain simultaneously. She couldn’t give all her friends the layers of protection she afforded herself and Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGVlZGZlMDBkNjRmMjlhNjBjY2Y1ZmJkYjIzN2E4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And even though she could ward Mel, she had refused the offer!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzVjMDQ4NDY0OTQxMmY4ODgzMTkzOTk2OWI2OWRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel had done so respectfully, explaining that any outside aether interference would limit the development of her warrior’s aura. The woman placed no blame on Amelia; instead, she looked back on the event as a positive experience. Apparently, the last thing she remembered was manifesting her first-ever orange aura. That alone seemed to overshadow the fact that she almost died. One of the first things she requested permission for was to send an aethergram to her family informing them of her breakthrough!</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2I4ODFkMjBmNTQ1NTY5MjVjMDIxYWM5NzhjZjJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena explained Mel’s attitude was a result of multiple intersecting forces. It was the combination of Eastern culture, the spirit of a warrior, and the pride of being an Imperial Officer. Serena actually seemed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">impressed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> with Mel’s attitude, directly hinting that she wanted Mel on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">’s Officer cohort after the semester ended.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjMwZjE4NDMyNjRlYzk4YWY2MGQwNTQ5YTdhODVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia was getting used to the various cultures she kept coming into contact with, but even after so many months, she still felt like an outsider sometimes and-</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWNjMDJkMDA2ZDQxMDk4MzdlOGZlYzFjZDk2YzU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still thinking about the incident?” Lunaria asked, interrupting Amelia’s self-reflection. “You’ve barely eaten in the three hours we’ve been at it,” she added, pointing towards the box of buns, each filled with delicious meat and vegetables.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODAzYzM5YjhjOTQ0MzdiYjI1MWE1ZDIzZDdmOTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine,” Amelia waved a hand. “I can heal my hunger away.” She invoked a quick burst of healing magic to emphasise the point, briefly painting the Speaker training room in a golden glow. Not only did her hunger disappear, but she also felt better mentally. A person could be injured in far more ways that aren’t readily visible to an observer, and Amelia was glad </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> healing seemed to understand that.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjdmYWMwMmEzZDRkZTM5NDE4M2VjMGIwMWM0NGU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shall we continue?” Amelia asked, immediately feeling more cheerful as she returned to her usual bubbly self. “We were five-point-five last time, and my perception lasted for fifteen minutes, so let’s try… six?” She gestured towards the aether-density gauges Lunaria had propped up in the room. They’d been taken from an old cruiser's upper and lower masts. Typically used to determine the aether density in the case of lumina storms, they were now repurposed to estimate the sheer amount of aether both Lunaria and Amelia had been cycling.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2EwODlhNmExOTQ2NWZhYWY3MjUxNGE4NGVkZWFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Lunaria affirmed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTRhYjE3NjdmMjQyZjJhZTlmOTVhZmIyNWMwZTli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They took their positions in the center of the room. Amelia sensed Lunaria expel her aether while forming </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, so she followed suit with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjllYTY3NmEwODQzZjNhY2I1YmY5ZmM3MDgzNzkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong><em>Igni</em></strong><strong>,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">” Spoke Lunaria.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjcyOWVhMzBiYzQ1MTFiYjk0Zjc0NzNiZDIzZGZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong><em>Taranis</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”, Spoke Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDRhY2ZjOWM1NjQ2NmQ4ZWM3YTkwOTBjMDAxZjVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike their prior duel, where they had both Spoken with enough aether in reserve to produce an explosive result, this time, there was only a subtle pulse, both in the aetherfield and the surrounding dirt and sand.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzQyNTcwZTAxNjQyYjI4M2NmMzQ1ZjIyYmEzYmI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a skill seen more often in mages due to their disproportionate focus on aether control, but still extremely rare. Speaking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">silently</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> had far more utility for warriors, though. The ability to Speak in combat without blowing away your surroundings and comrades or giving away your location to nearby aetherscopes was a tremendous advantage. Amelia had been trying to encourage Serena to practice the skill.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzBjZWExNDg3YTQzODNhYTExMTYyYjkyZDRjMmJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The more careful way of Speaking also led to less impressive transformations. Sure, Amelia once again had a wonderful set of glowing horns made out of densely wrapped lightning sprouting from her forehead, but they didn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">quite</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> crackle with as much energy as they had previously. For now, at least. The pair of them had been progressively increasing the amount of aether while under the divine communion of the First-Word.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTk1NDBkMWE1NzQwYTU4OTZmNDg4MjNjNmY5YThh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s begin,” Lunaria instructed, flapping her wings of hellfire.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWM3NTkzMjM4NTQzNGI4NDAwOTM3OGE3MjJmZGQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For the eighth time, they set about cycling enormous amounts of aether. The atmosphere quickly became dense with aether, and the density gauge slowly crept up. At two points, the atmosphere hummed with energy. At three points, there was enough aether to be lethal to an unprotected person with prolonged exposure. At four points, they were approaching the level of a lumina storm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjkwNjBiZDUzZjQwM2ZiMWNmM2EyNDM2MGQ3ODEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At five points, the Shimmer became visible.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWQzNDQxMmQ3ZDQwNWI5YzNhY2ZhZDc1MDJjYTRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A strange layered reality that shifted between greyscale and sepia. Through this new world, the perception of magic </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">changed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Amelia's cloaking wards, usually a solid bulwark against prying eyes, were now partially transparent, allowing Lunaria to sense approximately one-fifth of Amelia’s actual aether capacity. Similarly, Lunaria’s glamors could be seen through with no effort, and her wards were quickly identifiable. The underlying nature of aether became more transparent, which meant that identifying the nature of a specific spell was much more manageable.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmMyNTJmODZmMTRkOWNhZDU1MDllMmJlZWEzZGMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the Shimmer, it was difficult to disguise yourself or your actions.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWFhMTEyNmFmNTQzNzliOWJiMzM2YWQ2ZjMxZTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As they cycled titanic amounts of aether the barrier between the two realities broke down even further. It was becoming easier to differentiate the two worlds from each other. At first, Amelia had to focus intently on opening her perception, barely catching a glimpse of sepia. Now, only after doing it a few times, she was quickly getting to grips with it. It felt similar to the Spinning Dancer optical illusion from her old world, which consisted of an animated silhouette of a rotating figure. Without any visual cues for depth, the silhouette could be imagined as rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise. With enough practice, you could make it switch at will. Viewing the Shimmer was similar, but the amount of aether in the atmosphere made it easier.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWM4N2M4OGMzZjRhZmZiNTFiZWY3MTA4ZGVkMDU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm...” hummed Lunaria. “I’ll try attacking…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWZhMzg5Y2IyOTQ3OGE5MzgzODkyMGFhYTMzY2Fm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Head Instructor’s aether boiled, and Amelia was treated to a beautiful kaleidoscope of colours flowing around Lunaria within the Shimmer as the formation was constructed in the real world. The fireball manifested and was launched in her direction. A solid ball of churning hellfire, more than a meter in diameter, sought to burn her to a crisp.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWIyMTgwZWM1NTRjODdiMTVhMzE2NzJmMmY2OTU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fireball existed in the Shimmer as well, but only partially. Despite the spell using an enormous amount of aether on the outside, only a tiny amount, perhaps one-tenth, manifested in the Shimmer. It was as if the fireball was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">leaking</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a little of its aether.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjI5N2Q2YmE0MjQxNzJiOGEzMWRkODc3YzM0M2Ez" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia blocked the attack with a ward, prompting a burst of colour to erupt from the impact point in the Shimmer. She watched carefully and found that her hypothesis was proving true: Aether within the Shimmer naturally spread out when uncontrolled by a mage's willpower, eventually leaking undetected into the real world, appearing no different than normal aetherfield fluctuations.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmM0NjFkMmFjNDQxN2JiYTRmNDVjMmU4ZmQ1NDU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The operative word here being </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">uncontrolled</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Amelia, at all times, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">controlled</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a significant amount of aether to maintain Serena’s wards. After she’d faced complaints by Chesterfield regarding her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">river of aether</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> flowing across the Eastern Terra Firma to maintain Polina’s wards, she’d put in effort to cloak the even greater amounts of aether that protected Serena. By relying on her intuition and instinct, she’d found decent success in cloaking the telltale aetherflow that indicated Serena was warded, hiding the evidence from most normal mages. Now, with her new and growing perception, she understood that what she had achieved was to simply </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shift </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">the aetherflow into the Shimmer.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjQyMjFmMDdlMTRhYTk5MWQzN2UzOGZkNzIwYWUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They continued to conduct further experiments. While they both could readily </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">see</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> into the Shimmer, Lunaria believed that travelling </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">into</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the mysterious space should be possible. She’d shown Amelia fragments of writing of scholars from various periods in the Empire’s history that discussed the possibility. Frustratingly, none of them shared any actual method. Lunaria suggested that a way would appear if they channelled even more aether.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDVkMmI0ODIyYzRmNGFiMDc2M2E2YjFhYzExNzkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, travelling to this other realm was a long-term target. They had a far more reachable goal in mind. Together, they’d discovered that if they maintained a little focus, they could still see inside the Shimmer even after they’d stopped cycling such enormous amounts of aether and even after they released their Words. It was as if now that they’d been exposed to the Shimmer with such clarity, some of that clarity remained with them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTlkNTRhNjIxNzRhZGY5NmQxN2RlOWE1NTIzMjgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were training their perception, opening it up to the world's truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDMyMWIwNTc5NDRjYTY5NzQxMTg2YmUwN2FmOTk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their last round of cycling aether had reached the five-point-five mark on the aether-density gauge. Without Amelia, Lunaria could only get a little over five for a short period. This time they reached six, causing the real world and the Shimmer to be as clear as day.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDBlMjQ1MmNkNDRmNjZiNTk2NjI3ZjE4ZTVjNjRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia could even start to see Lunaria’s beautiful, shining soul.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjZhZmQyMzgxYzQ0NTNiMTU3ODBiZTIzYzhjYjI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With more practice, would she be able to see and identify blessings like she could under the embodiment of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyOThkODA5MDhiZDRkM2NhM2E1MjI1NTUyMzFiNzY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few more minutes of cycling, Lunaria began to struggle under the intensity. With a nod, they both released their Words. The density gauge dropped to two, but the Shimmer was still within her perception, even without the extra sensory organ of Amelia’s horns. It was notably more opaque than before, but they could still </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">see</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it. Slowly, as time passed, that opaqueness grew more and more until it became a barely visible muddy reflection of the world.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzE2NzY3MjZiYjRmYjdiNzM2MWZjZWIxMjY4NmRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But Amelia could still see it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDY0MGU3NTM4NDQ2ZjFiMGJjNGI0ZDE5MmQ3MWQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I’ve cracked it,” Amelia said, feeling her forehead furrow in concentration.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWYzOWJjZmI5YzQ5YzE4MTQ5NzExY2RlYzZiMGEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cracked?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzIyZWZkZDFlNDRhZDM5OTc2Yzk5Mjk3NzVkNDYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean I think I can still see it, only just. What's the gauge indicating?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTg3ZjUyYTkzYzRjNGQ5YTI3YzVkNDJmMGMwNDQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...point five.” Lunaria took a breath. “That’s almost atmospheric levels.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGExMmIxYTMwNjQ4MDZhY2MwZjQ2NjA3NmZmNDQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…” Amelia mumbled, focusing her aether around her eyes, maximising her perception. Yes, she wasn’t mistaken. She could still see the Shimmer. Her eyes had adjusted as if they’d learned how to perceive light outside the visible spectrum. Only instead of a new colour, it was a whole new plane of reality.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2IxM2E2ZTUwMTQ5ZDVhZDc4MmU0YjZlNjg3Y2Ey" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t anything close to the clarity she had under the influence of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> while blasting aether. Still, it was enough to vaguely see the outline of Lunaria’s shape and the faintest perception of the vibrant colours of her formations.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGEyYTk3Zjg1YTQxY2U5Yzc2N2Y5NmQzMTM4ZGQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia let her enhancements reduce ever so slightly, toying between the point at which the Shimmer became hidden. She needed to train herself to perceive this hidden world even when she wasn’t buffed up on many perception-enhancing spells. Otherwise, she would be nursing a constant headache that would need continuous healing day in and day out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTUyZWRhN2U3MjRmN2FhN2U5Mzg5NzUzMzhlMDFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you still see it…?” Lunaria asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWEzNDk0MGQ4ZTRmMjM5ZGFkMjljMDkyOWNhZGFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it goes when I reduce some of my spells, but I can bring it back.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDkzMjk3ZDM2MjQzYTRhNDdhYWYwMmUxYWI3ZDlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Incredible…” came the muttered reply.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWQ2MWIxNmFhZTQ0ZTQ4OWE0ZGMzZGYyM2MzMWMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia silently agreed. In the previous attempts, once they lost perception of the Shimmer, they had to spool back up to First-Word levels of aether to regain their sight. Now, Amelia’s senses were experienced enough to recover that sight without Speaking.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmVmOTRkMDk1MDRmMThhMTRmNjNjOWQ2OWEwNTNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you sense anything different about me when I’m looking into the Shimmer?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjM3MGJiMThmOTQ2MDNiMzY4Yzg3MjhjMGMxMGQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria said she couldn’t, even when flaring her aether to the best of her ability.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGZjNzNiMjM5YTQ0N2ZhM2UxN2JiY2EzOGVmZjc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you can maintain that sight while under atmospheric amounts of aether…” Lunaria began. “The advantage would be tremendous.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWQyZWI2MDVmOTRlYmJhMGI1YTM4Y2IyZGY4YmUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right.” Amelia nodded. “Imagine the advantage in a duel,” she added, thinking of Hinako. In Cascadian society, a mage or warrior walking around maintaining a few wards or a low-level aura was considered an acceptable measure of pre-emptive self-defence. A sudden flaring of aura or spell formation was considered a precursor to conflict. It was why cloaking was so powerful. A person who could disguise their third-circle ward as a first-circle one, or their orange aura as a red aura, would be able to mislead their opponents or potential attackers. A mage with good enough cloaking could even hide the fact they were preparing an attack.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWExNGZiYzI3YjRlYmM4MGFiYTQ3Y2Q5ZGYwY2Vi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But if you could examine people through the Shimmer, their actual capabilities would become evident. You would know who was hiding their strength or preparing for an attack. In all honestly, it wasn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> much of an enhancement over Amelia’s standard abilities. She could already push her perception to such unbelievable heights, backed by tremendous amounts of cloaked aether, that she’d only met two people she couldn’t perceive.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmQ1ZTc3NDNjYzQ0NzlhYzIyNTU2YjliNjM0NWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And one of them was a Formless.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWFlODI2NjIwODQ2YWViZjE4N2FmMjIwMjA5YTYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What would Anathor look like through the Shimmer? She’d read most of the book - </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">The Formless: Sightings and Conversations</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> - and was eager to interrogate, no, have a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">conversation </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">with him. Maybe he would know something about this mysterious inner world.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTkzOTUxMDQ0MzRhYTk5YjBiNjU1NmUwODY3Njk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She also made a mental note to work on her cloaking. She thought her cloaks were an impenetrable wall against prying eyes, allowing her to construct formations freely. However, through the Shimmer, her cloaks were surprisingly transparent, allowing someone like Lunaria to gain a bit more information about Amelia’s true capabilities that she’d rather stay hidden.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWI2Y2QxNGJiMzQ0NjZhMTNhZWQxZjA2MGIxNzZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, the aged and tactful Head Instructor hadn’t mentioned anything.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDdhZmEyNGZmMDQzYzRiNzUyZjQxNTg0YmYxNTJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ready to go again?” Lunaria asked. Amelia caught the unmistakable glint of hunger in the Aether Addict’s eyes. There was no way the old demon would let Amelia go until she could also see the Shimmer under atmospheric levels of aether.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTlkZTJjMjIyNzQ1ZDQ4YmEyNzFjZDMwMTExYzUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chuckling, Amelia got into position, and once again, the pair invoked their Words. Lunaria was extremely talented, and raising her perception to the required level shouldn't take long, especially with Amelia's help.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTc1YTM0MDM3OTRmMDQ5Njc0M2YyYjc3YWU2OWUy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right?</span></p>

<p class="cnMxZjVmYTA1YzBhNDRjMDA5YjE1NWVjY2JmZjRmZGYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Noburu POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/noburu.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmRjYWIxZjIyMjQ4ZTdhZTJiOWQzYzMyMzM1ZGI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Under pressure from Seonmi, the archivist Takumi sought permission from his superior, Noel Yamaguchi, Head of the Department of History and Military Studies. The Department Head's narrow, investigative eyes worried Noburu, but Seonmi’s act as the work-driven Yunseo Yoo-Jung won through, and they got permission for her to explore the storage room for replacement rivets.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmE1ZjA2YmU0ZDQwZDc4Y2ZjOGJkMTMzOTIxY2Y1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, he seemed annoyed they’d bothered him with the request.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmI0OTFhNDM2MDQ5ZGZhYjQ1ODY0MGIzZDBiZTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Department Head reiterated they must remain under guard, and since they could only spare a singular pair of horns to guard them, Noburu and Seonmi had to move together. While Noburu clenched his jaw in annoyance and Seonmi clicked her tongue, it was actually the ideal outcome. This way, they could both explore the storage under the guise of Seonmi searching for replacement metal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWFjODJiY2FiYTRjMTZhMDY1ZDRiYmI5Y2QzZjhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The storage facility was a large basement filled with old boxes and crates. Takumi explained that while many of the items had been stored here for decades, the room itself was regularly cleaned of dust, and its exterior was maintained to prevent moisture from creeping in.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODhlM2NlZDJiNDQwNTFiZWJiODcxMzk3OTY2MTFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Long before my time, all these were kept upstairs,” Takumi explained, gesturing towards the boxed artefacts. “Eventually, someone realised the temperature fluctuations through the seasons and changing humidity were contributing to their degradation. They were moved down here… a little over a century ago. I just finished cataloguing everything myself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTEwY2QxNjg0YTRlYTk5MzA4NjUyNDBkMWQzNzk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moons… you organised all this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">yourself</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” Seonmi intoned, her voice laced with professional appreciation and a touch of femininity as she moved to sweeten the archivist’s mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGI4YTcxMjIzNDRiMjdhYWFiNDNkYTMyYzVkNTBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Took a long time!” Takumi replied cheerfully. “You wouldn’t believe how many boxes were mislabelled or objects from multiple eras piled under the same label. Here, each row is roughly two centuries…” He gestured to the left, where a small pile of boxes lay. “Starting with pre-Cascadian times. The Samino Museum took anything of interest, but a few scraps remain. We have miscellaneous stone tools in here that date back to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">five thousand</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> B.V! Most demons don’t care too much for their heritage that far back, only showing interest in something big like the Needles of Nai or great desert geoglyphs like the Dectus Lines. But I think there’s a story to be told in these little bits of knapped rocks.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjU3MTU5MDc5NzRhN2M5OWI4Mzc4NjU1MGZmMmNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu raised his eyebrows in interest, walking over to the area of boxes. Takumi unclasped one box, opening it to reveal what was neatly labelled as a stone axehead.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTg1YTJkMDRkMzQyNWM4M2IxNzNlNjc0ZDQ0MmI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Who cares? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu thought before mentally slapping himself to get back into character.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTkxZTQ2Zjg1ZjRlZmU5Y2FiZWMzMTViMGZmY2Nh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fascinating examples of Stone Age technology,” Noburu murmured, leaning closer to examine the knapped items. “To think there was a time, long before the Long Discordancy, long before the wilderness, where we were cutting down natural trees, not even knowing how to smelt copper.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDZjNDNkMGZhZDQwODhhMTk3MzY4NGY1MDgzOWIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How were they dated?” Seonmi asked. “Stratigraphic principles?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTExY2I3MTg5MzRmNjlhZjJhYTc0MjFmNGU2ZmE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” Takumi affirmed, checking the labels. “San-Tir archaeological site. Discovered seven-sixty-five A.V. If I remember my modern history… that’ll be one of the central sites discovered during the last major wilderness clearing in the direction of Nachon.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjZlMjZiNzU3NjQ2MDE4NjYzMTIxNjYxMzhhNDI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about the first row, here?” Seonmi pointed towards the left-most row of boxes, which, while more populous than their Stone Age neighbours, were lacking compared to the other rows further down.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzU3YWNmNWFkOTRmMjE5YzdjZjMxZDA3ODc5OTBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dark Ages,” Takumi answered. He approached and patted the first box. “Mostly fragments of iron and steel tools. Some broken ceramics. Again, the Samino Museum bought most of it a long time ago. I’ve organised it chronologically. The boxes in this little section are two-fifty to two-hundred B.V. Then, you see the red marker on the box there?” Takumi pointed out a small red flag a few meters down. “That marks the Continent Collision with the Dark Lands in one-eighty-two B.V. Then, further down, we cover the century-long period of the Long Discordancy. We have a few fragmented skeletons of the Enemy, but nothing worth displaying. Past that…” He gestured to the very end of the row, which was dimly lit with a weak aetherlight. “We have armour and blades from her Holy Reconquista. We have fifty-six of her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Thousand Blades</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Twenty are in storage down here, fifteen are stored elsewhere in the academy, and the remainder you can see displayed in the main throughway.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDJiMTJhMjEyNjRlMzdhZGQ4MzNjZGNhNWY1MWMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The archivist walked to the next row, followed by Noburu and Seonmi. The guard standing outside the entrance didn’t move, but then again, why would he? The man was likely an aura user and could hear everything they were up to anyway.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2YyNGY4ODU4ZjQ2NDZiYzFhZDkyZTg2ZDU4MTNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here we have the next two centuries. One A.V to two hundred A.V. We have some great examples of early Imperial weaponry during the Consolidation Era. In the second century, we have a moderate number of artefacts from the War of the Spear. This is where we start to see traditional Samino armour utilising ironwood bark. We have some fully preserved polearms on display from this period upstairs.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDQxMGMzMGEyOTQ4YTZhOGNlNTM2ZDllMzc4ZWRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Polearms? Including the shaft?” Seonmi asked, raising an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTFjMDk5NTE3NzQwZmRiZDE2MzczOTJiMzI3YTgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” Takumi answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjYwZjc1YTdjNDQzYWY4NjQ5ZmZjOWVmN2ZlZDVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How? The wood should have long decomposed. Unless…?” Seonmi trailed off, tilting her head at the archivist. “A bog?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDYyNGJjYWExMjQ5MDE5NDNlNjQ4ZDNlMjJjNDBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Correct!” Takumi enthusiastically answered. “Presevered in the oxygen-less environment of a peat bog. They found bodies as well! They are so well preserved that they look like they could wake up at any moment despite being seven hundred years old! We don’t have them here, unfortunately.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWYzNDI3NGVhMTQyNjJiNGRkNDZlNTczYjFmNzA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Bog Soldiers,” Noburu intoned. “I’ve never had the opportunity to see them myself. Where are they? Let me guess…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTIxZWVmY2Y0MzQ1NmRiYzk2NGUwZTkzYTEwNDY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Samino Museum,” Takumi finished with an exasperated sigh. “They have the privilege to forcefully purchase any artefacts in Samino territory before they go to auction. They send someone every few years to poke their horns in what we have. Many of the items we have on display are on loan from the museum.” The man frowned in annoyance before collecting himself. “Right, where were we?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzdkZjI5ZmYyMzQ0N2E5NDBiM2YyNWJhZjBiN2Vi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Takumi continued to the next row. “Two hundred A.V to four hundred A.V. We have armour and weapons from the Early Religious Wars, The Three Sisters' War, and finally the Late Religious Wars that ended just before the turn of the fifth century.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGE1MjE5OGQ5MjRmMjU4MjUyNzNjOGEwZjYyYmNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Takumi continued to the second last row. This one was filled to the brim with crates and boxes. This aligned with the preparation work Noburu had done; he understood the fifth and sixth centuries were when restoration efforts and archaeological evacuation began to become popular.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGQ4MGY3YjFkYTQ1ZDliNzk2NmMyYWY4NmI0MzY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Five hundred A.V to six hundred A.V. I imagine this is where you’ll find your replacement rivets,” Takumi explained while nodding his head. “About halfway down, we have all the War of the Ten Houses examples. Shall we?” They followed Takumi down the row, and suddenly, Noburu felt like he were in a forest of boxes. “Try to avoid rotating any boxes and open them </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">in situ </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">if possible. If you look at each box's label, I’ve noted the quality of what’s inside. Anything with three x’s should be a candidate for replacements.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2Y2ODYwMWZjMTRkZTg5ZDNiZmVlYWViYWYwZjFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You judged they were beyond restoration?” Seonmi asked with a sly smile. “You’ve been holding out on us, Takumi.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDY5Y2U4YjZmNzQ5ZTc4ZTdiODYwZThkZDMzMDlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha.” The archivist rubbed the back of his neck. “Just guessing mainly, but it doesn’t take a genius to see if something is beyond recovering. I’ve always thought artefacts are like people. Once they degrade or corrode beyond a certain threshold, there’s no hope of recovery, is there?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzYwZTQ4NzA1MjRiZTc5NjA3MjllMDcwOGNmMzRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s always hope,” Noburu snapped. He tried to hide his annoyance, but Takumi’s words angered him. The attitude of the nobles regarding the slums and their inhabitants was the same. It was so easy to look down on those underneath you, pretending they were alien, that their circumstances would never befall </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2UwZWUxZDY5MzQ3Yjg5ZDdmYTRlYTA1ZDQ2M2Ux" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moons,” Seonmi cooly intoned. “You missed your morning coffee or something?” She rolled her eyes, gesturing dramatically to a nearby box. “Takumi, mind helping?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODc1N2UxZjZkYTQ2NmM5ZTNkNWQzMjU1NGM4MDVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, of course…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjE4YWZkMDljYzRlMTg5YWJmZjVlODZjNzMzNDVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A glare from Seonmi set Noburu’s mind straight. Right, right. He wasn’t Noburu here.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWViMThmNTM4NDRiMmI4YTVkOGMyODc0ODM5MGRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They began opening boxes, examining the often delicate pieces within. Seonmi kept Takumi smitten and the atmosphere jovial. Noburu joined in on the conversation, keeping the man talking. Most people liked talking about themselves, and Takumi was no exception. He also clearly found Seonmi attractive, something the crafty woman had picked up on and was abusing subtly. She began moving in a way that emphasised her form and started giggling and smiling at his terrible jokes. Given how intentionally snappy she’d been earlier, Takumi must have thought his charm had won her over.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDZkYmMyN2Q0YjQxMzk4ZjdjOGY4N2I0ZDViYzc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Poor man.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTg4NGNlYjhiZTQzMmU4NGYzZjFmYmFkOTliY2Ri" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Key. Question.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Seonmi indicated with her hands when Takumi wasn’t looking.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDEwOGY3NjU4MDQ3MzE4Y2I1OWQzMDAyZmM2MjQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Injury. Act. You. Question.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> He flashed his reply quickly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODI5N2VmZTI5MTQwMzlhYzU3YTA5MTRiZDQwOWUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. Ready. Question.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4Mjg3ODI2MmM5ZTQ0YzY4ZTM3ZWRhNTNlNTQ4Mzgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTk0NmZmNGQ2MTQyY2Q5OWRlMWQ4NjI2YTVmMzEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The archivist kept his keys on a keyring attached to his belt. One of those keys was a large iron key used to enter the storage room. One way or another, they needed access to that key.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODNhZDI3NTI5YjRjNmQ5OGFjODYzZjZkOTMzNzVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This one up here, please, Takumi,” Seonmi indicated to the box on a shelf at her shoulder height. Before Takumi could respond, she began shifting it over the edge. The archivist quickly moved to assist her. Noburu positioned himself behind the man.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzI2NGY3MjA5ODQzY2I5Y2NjZjA4Njc5YWZiNzE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-slowly!” Takumi exclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDAzMzk3YzRjOTQ5ZGJhMzgyYTY1YzJhY2Y4NzI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine…” Seonmi grunted. “Just need to- moons!” Seonmi’s ankle rolled, and her form collapsed, releasing the box which crashed to the ground. She swore loudly, her face contorting in pain.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODI4ZTQ5NmVlMjQ4NTQ4Mzc1YmExNzg2ZDhjYmVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yunseo!” Noburu cried out, barging into Takumi, unhooking his key ring while simultaneously tripping the man. “I got it!” Noburu grabbed the crate. “Go help her!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Njc0YzliNTBhODQ0MGQ4MDZiYWM1ZTlmYjRlMTA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Takumi stumbled up, assisting Seonmi who was clutching her ankle while letting out a colourful string of curses. The man helped her stand before bending down and examining the ankle.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDA2ZjNmNWVlNzRmMmNiZmZiMTgwMDNhZmFhYzMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Doesn’t look broken,” he said. “It might swell up something terrible. If you wait here, I’ll get some ice.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjgxYmQ3MzA0NjQxZDE4NjQyZmE2YWFkODQxNDc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have ice? Here?” Noburu asked, gently lowering the end of the crate onto the ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2NkODNkMTZmZjQ1YWNiYjc0ZTMzZTc4Y2NmMTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Advantages of having a cohort of trainee mages,” Takumi explained. “Making ice is good practice for many of them, so we have an endless supply. I’ll ask the guard to grab some and see if he can find an assistant instructor from the medical department. Even a student would appreciate the practice. Oh, wait!” The archivist stood up quickly, freezing on the spot before shaking his head. “No, it’s not broken, is it? The Grandmaster wouldn’t want me bothering </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> for something like this.”</span></p><span class="cjFmMjYyNjkyZmJlNzQ2MmZhMTdjNGU0NWJjNWVlOTVj"><br/>You could be reading stolen content. Head to Royal Road for the genuine story.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM2MjBiZjc5ODRlYzQyZDRhZjVjMjc0NjBjMDk1ZDM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takumi,” Noburu stated.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2VmNWZmMjYzMjQxMjQ4ZGZmMzBlNzNkYjA1ZTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWZmNjMxMTBhZTQzYjM5ZDc3MmM4MGEzYjJhMjRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your keys.” Noburu pointed, bringing Takumi’s attention towards his key ring, now lying innocently on the floor. “Sorry for tripping you; I panicked.” Noburu apologised with a slight bow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGE3OGY1YjlkMjQ4NWNhZGIzYzEwYjc2MTZmMDRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Takumi picked up his keys, verified they were all still there and re-attached the key ring to the belt. “Don’t worry yourself, worry about poor Miss Yoo-Jung.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTYwZmZiZGQ0NDQwY2Y5ZjBkODNkNjViY2E2ODFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Call me Yunseo,” Seonmi replied, tentatively placing down her foot and wincing at the imagined pain.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzhjMThlN2JhMTRiZGY4NDExNTY2NDgyZTg1NTI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yunseo, of course.” Takumi beamed. “I’ll be right back.” He left, walking down the row while calling for the guard.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWRlMjk5MjQ0NTQ4OGNhODRlMTk1ZTM1M2ExYjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You alright?” Noburu asked, raising an eyebrow. Seonmi’s acting was so good he would have believed she’d actually rolled her ankle if he hadn’t witnessed her practising this injury multiple times in Yoshiro’s den.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGFkM2YyZjU1ZDQ0NGRhMmMxOGY4ODQ5OTUzYjYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got a little enthusiastic, I suppose. Should be fine with some ice…” She tailed off, looking past Noburu at the back of Takumi. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Key. Success. Question, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">her hands signalled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTRkM2VjMDYxNDQyOGU4ZTE0NTMyZDg3ZDg3ZGQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Success</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Noburu signalled back, patting the hidden pocket of his uniform where a slim box filled with clay carried an impression of Takumi’s storage room key. Seeing this, Seonmi visibly relaxed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjQ2NTlmMTkzYjQxMDk4NDMzMWMwZWIyZmJjYjAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was one task down. Now, they just needed to find the artefact they were contracted to steal, and then Noburu could sneak back in this very night, and they’d be done!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmVlNzVmOGRlYjQzOTU5ZGRhYzk2YWY0NjA0NDAw" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Surely Takumi wouldn’t mind if they asked to see a few more examples?</span></p>

Even now, as she convected her aether, readying it to break into orange for the tenth time, she couldn’t keep the smile off her face. Orange! She’d reached orange! Even if her plan of becoming a squad commander fell through, she would have no trouble finding employment for the rest of her life as an elite guard for some wealthy merchant or noble. With this, she’d practically caught up with her brother, who-</span></p>

<p class="cnMxNDgyZjJlYjMxNTQzMjRhYzFlOWYxMmE2ZTY0NDBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel blinked her attention back into her room. She climbed out of her meditation position and rotated the crystal in the wall, turning the dim aetherlights up. She slipped on her shoes, opening the door to find a familiar sight.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTA3OTMyY2EyNDRjZDlhNzNhZTY1MmM3NGU1NjE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello!” Amelia chirped at her. “It’s so dark tonight, and the moon’s so big! I wanted to walk around the academy grounds to look at it, but it’s awkward to walk around with so many patrolling guards. So…” Amelia trailed off, shuffling her feet. “Could you come with me? I want to hear about your new aura!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTdjZGJiMzI2YjQ4NTViNTBiYjRjY2E0NTEzNzlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Sure,” Mel answered. “Let me get ready.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTM1ZGRmZjgyMDRhYThiODk1ZDczNTg5NGNkMTg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, they were outside the magic tower, walking along one of the academy's stone paths that snaked through the managed gardens and woods. Amelia wasn’t saying much, seemingly focused intently on something else.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGNlNDg4ZDI1ODRhMDdiYzUzMTZlNjY1NjVhODVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your mind seems occupied with other thoughts,” Mel pointed out.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjhlYzIwOGEzNDRhNTRiMjdiZGU4NjZmMmJmOGM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” came the reply. “I’m training my eyes to look into a mysterious, secretive realm!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGMxY2FjMDlhYTQ4M2FiZjFlMTIzNDg4ZjkzNmM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel rolled her eyes. Sure. It figured Amelia would have difficulty explaining the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">real</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> reason she asked her to accompany her for this walk. Mel knew Amelia felt some kind of guilt associated with the other night's events. Last night, Amelia hadn’t slipped off like she normally did, instead choosing to stay in her quarters. Mel suspected it was because she didn’t want to risk being absent for another attack. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjA0N2I1NmE2NTRjNGM4MWViOTYxNTYxNjBlNmIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Did she bring Mel with her tonight because she just wanted to go on a walk and didn’t want to leave Mel alone?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODgxZDM1YTlmOTQyZjU4YmQxZjlkNGQyZGUwNDhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxNTAyNzdhZGRmODRjMGJhMmYyMTNhYmU5MjRhY2E1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Freaky?”</span></p>

<p class="cnM3MjE4MzJmZjNjMTQwNWU4ZjM4Y2EzOTJjOTMwMzJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, we </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">are</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the gardens,” Mel gestured to the surrounding flowers. “Not a suspicious place to find plant life, is it?” She folded her arms and raised an eyebrow at Amelia. It was a manner of speaking she would never dare with any other nobility, but Mel had become quite close to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thornheart in a surprisingly short amount of time.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTAwNzg0OGQ0ZTRmN2E5ZDgzMGQzMzdkNzk0YWU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I mean…” Amelia wrinkled her nose, looking around. “Never mind, let’s keep-” Amelia froze, her mouth hanging open as she looked up in shock at the great blue moon above. Mel took in the shimmering light that painted the East in a gentle blue hue. Even with Mel’s eyes, enhanced with only red aura, she could see the telltale marks of the volcanic activity upon the moon's surface.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGNiZTZmNTg5MjQ3YmE4MWViMDE1NjljZTY1NTU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Mel asked. “We’re lucky to have the moons.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzJmYTBjZjNiNDQ2ODdhODgyMTM2NjJhM2M3ZWE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So they’re not moons…” Amelia mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTBiMzYzZTQ4YTQyMDNhN2I0ZmY4YmJjZjg5YmUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry?” Mel frowned.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTI4NWY2ZGIyNTQ4NmRiNjNhMjA2ZjZmZjZmOGI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah!” Amelia twisted around, a smile on her face, waving her hands. “I mean, you’re right! The moon crystals fuel the modern era! It makes things like the lift engine possible! Without them, how could the Empire stay together?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDdiNDUwNTMyZjQ5OGJiYzNlNzZkYzc5N2ZhOGZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, much of it is connected by rail now. I’m sure we’d survive without them.” Mel pointed at the ring of material around the moon. “Look, you can see all the tephra about to break free of its gravity.” Soon, tens of thousands of tonnes of crystal would carve through the atmosphere, breaking up before slowing down and blessing the East. Blue crystal was the most sought-after for lift engines, as it produced the strongest aetheric-lumina reaction, meaning ships using it could fly higher than an opponent using any other crystal fuel.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDM3OGVhNGY5MjRjMmJhYjA4MjhhZTdmYTA4ZWZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I see it…” Amelia resumed looking at the moon and stayed silent for a full minute before shaking her head and skipping past Mel. “Come on!” she called. They continued their walk, passing through the wooded area on the academy's north side. They passed more than one patrol on their way, and Amelia had to identify herself before they let them go.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjgyNjQ5MDQyMjRiNGFhZjg1YTY5NzI3YWNkODNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For an academy so surrounded by the city, they’ve done a tremendous job of disguising it!” Amelia pointed out. “The walls are only twenty meters or so, but all the paths and trees are designed to hide your line of sight, so you feel like you’re in the countryside!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWYyNDYyNWJhMzRiNTFiNTIwNjkzNmY5Y2FjN2Nk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Countryside?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGIxMDI0MWZkODQ0NDQ5NzIzYTg0YjZhNWFhZTI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, you know…” Amelia began to explain the unfamiliar term. It was more or less a human word for the rural lowlands. After hearing the explanation, it made sense to Mel; humankind never had to build their population centres in the mountains; they had all their cities on their lowlands. Only to them, it wasn’t the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lowlands</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, it was just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">normal land</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTVkYmQ2OWM4NzRhODhiMjUxZDdmMmNlMDY4Mzgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Humans are weird,” Mel muttered before quickly apologising.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjQ0ZWUxY2FjNTQ5NzQ5Y2Q2M2RlMjM5NjZmNGQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia threw an enthusiastic thumbs up her way. “Sure we are! But, demons are weirder!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODk3OWMxMTNmNDQ0NzhhZGI1ZGY4ZjE5ZWU0YTYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe, but my father used to say…” Mel raised an open hand before clenching it into a fist and pulling it over her chest. “...Demons have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">direction</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. We have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">duty</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Like humans, we commune with our gods but are also </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ruled</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> by one. You can look at the history of the human continent and see that empires rise and fall throughout the centuries, but not </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Cascadia</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” She reached into the sky, the backdrop of the blue moon enveloping her hand. “We are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">eternal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” she finished triumphantly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTVkYjllMTViYTQxZDY5MmY2MGU5ZWFmYzk3ZDk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">All was quiet momentarily before a giggle broke the silence, followed by Amelia’s clapping.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDQ1OGU2OWJiYjQ4NGM5NGM2Y2RmM2Y0MzQyOTkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How dramatic! I didn’t know you were such a nationalist!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2I2YWVmMjFiYzRlOTY5ZmI0MmM1YTBmZTEwOTUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nationalist?” Mel frowned.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2NkOTU2OWIyYjRjYjg5MWYwNmQ3ZmEwNWY3N2Ri" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wrong word? I mean… umm?” Amelia offered with a shrug.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTJhZmRiYzMwMzRlZTU4ODQ2MDQxZmFkYWRkZTM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Imperialist.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGQzZTUzMWI4NDRjZDNhYzNkNDdhYWU2NDZhNDgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Imperialist!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjRkMTFmNzk2YjQ1NmZhMjYyNTlhYWM5ZGZlY2U3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong with that?” Mel asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGJiZWY1NDM4NTQ1NmJiNTJmMzc4NGJiZjU2YWFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing!” Amelia replied cheerfully. “Just nice to see someone passionate about something. Sometimes, your determination reminds me of Serena!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDQ5ZTM0ODczODRjNDZiN2IzOWQ4OWZmNTk2ZmQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Serena…” Mel echoed, feeling her pride blossom. Instructor Halen, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain Halen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, or even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Halen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, was semi-famous around the academy. A war hero who had cracked the Republican defences by liberating the key logistic hub of Port Highwind. A captain of the mysterious black ship, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. A Speaker of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, her distinctive pair of horns - the pinnacle of Samino nobility - were said to become wreathed in hellfire when she Spoke, earning her the moniker of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hellfire Captain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. They say there wasn’t a Republican soldier who didn’t fear seeing her ship on the horizon.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTM0NTVkNTRhODQ1M2RhYmM2ODgzZjczNDc4NWEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">To think Amelia, who was technically a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">noble, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">just compared Mel to her!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmQ1NDNmMWE3NDQwNTViYTdjYmM3YWZiMWFkYzY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia was close to Instructor Halen, and Mel recently found out Amelia wasn’t sneaking off at night to be with a man but instead, she was being trained by the instructor in person! How lucky was she to have such a casual relationship with a war hero? To learn from one of the best! They had a relationship that bypassed the usual concerns of demon-human relationships. Mel hadn’t missed the playful banter they sometimes directed towards each other during the joint training session.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDI0ZTlmOGIyNjQzZTY5YTU5ZjhkOWMwZjI4OWE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were… awfully close, weren’t they?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTYwZWE1ZWQxNzQ3MWE4NjZjYzkyZTcwNWE1ZDUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel’s mind mentally kicked itself away from the line of thought she was about to go down. Tsk! How improper of Mel to even begin to entertain such an idea? After all, Instructor Halen had been so kind as to volunteer her time to train her, and Amelia had equally been so kind as to forgive and heal Mel after she stupidly enraged her at the Kenhoro Officer Academy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWU5Nzc0MDVmMDQ2MmQ4MmJlYjg3MmI5ZDYwNzI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although…</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2ZiZjBiZTM0NDRiM2U4ZjcwYmM0NGIwYWM5YmMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel reluctantly forced her mind back onto the track she didn’t want to be on. What exactly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">did</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she say to Amelia to annoy her so much back then? What was it that she said that caused Instructor Halen - then a visiting guest - to become </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">angry and glare at her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">much?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTY0OTBlOGQ3ODRkMDY4NjNjMmNiN2U4NjYyZGUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel had insulted Amelia, accusing her of being Instructor Halen’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">paramour</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> - a human to keep the demon’s bed warm. A sexual plaything.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzc3MjkxMDdkNzQzYmE5YTIyOTFkZmRlMThjZTg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">…They were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">awfully</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> close, weren’t they?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjg0Zjk2ZjlmYzRlZTY5ZDFhNzRhYjEwN2YwYTBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, Amelia said she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">stayed the night</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> after training. She claimed it was to save the walk back and forth. On the face of it, it made sense, but then why would Amelia be so flustered at that time when Mel asked her where she was going?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDI0N2M1ZThkYzRiMGZiNzU0YTE3OTYyMDIwNmI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No! Surely not!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2MxMDliMTE0OTRiOGQ4YzExZTY2MjViOWFiY2Rm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But… maybe?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGY5MTI5OTYwNDRmMzE4OGM5YzA4YzFhZDcxYjFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGM4ZDgyZjBhMzQ5ZmU4MTY1YTlmMzkzZDY4ZGVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, it made sense, didn’t it?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTYxMzY2NTI2YzQwNWFhMjE5MmQ2ZWQzMmJkNTc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh no!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDg1MjZhYmM0OTQzYjdiZDdkYjE3MGVkZjkwNTVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel brought her hands to her cheeks, hiding the sudden blush that formed. Surely not! It was indecent! It was a sin! Wasn’t Instructor Halen a Christian!? Mel had seen the golden Petrine cross on a necklace. And Amelia… was Amelia religious? She must be, but did she follow a demon faith, or a human one?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTQxNzY1M2M4ZjQwYzI5ZTk4ZDFhMzMwMGQ5Y2U4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It all added up… but… oh moons! How she wished it didn’t!</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGVjNDU4ODg5ODRhYjZhZmE4NjIwYmFhZGJlYzhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, we’re back!” Amelia’s happily announced.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzNmZjFmN2Q2NzQwYzRiNzkzNjA0MTNjYzMwMjQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were standing in front of the enormous front doors of the academy. They stood fully open, with no less than four guards standing around. They stepped aside, letting the pair of women through.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDVhOTJlZDdhNTQ2NDI4OWM0YTMyMTMyNWI2NmJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s take a walk through the main throughway before we go back to the tower,” Amelia continued. “I’d like to see some of the artefacts again!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzM4ZGVlZmNjYTRhNGE5OTJjZjg1NDIwMThhOTI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel followed Amelia obediently while her mind raced. She wished it didn’t add up, but the more she thought about it, the more it did! The times she’d witnessed Amelia and Instructor Halen together, wasn’t there a certain softness underpinning their conversations? Didn’t Instructor Halen’s lips curl upwards when Amelia approached her during training? Didn’t they stand and sit a little closer together than one might assume was proper?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTM4ZmU5ZjllNzQxMGU5ZTE4NDFmYzU3YTY4NjM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel stopped to see Amelia, who had also stopped just ahead of her at the junction where you could turn left or right. Her back towards Mel. She was oddly still. Had she deduced Mel’s thoughts?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODAyMTcwMGZkZjQyNTg5ZTdkMDRmMDczY2I3MjBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel swallowed loudly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDcwYWQxN2JiMjRiNDZiYjM4MjVjY2YyNDU5NDdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia…” she tentatively began.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGE2NmViOTQwNjQwNTQ5YTMxOWZhODEwNDQyM2Ji" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait,” Amelia commanded. All friendliness from her voice was gone. She wasn’t speaking as a friend or an acquaintance but as a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">noble</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. This was a command.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzUwMjRmZTAzNDQ0NzY5NDgwMzExM2FiY2JjNmNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel froze, her instincts tickling her. Danger. Surely, not from Amelia?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODg5ZTNlNGZkZDQ4ZjM5ODNjM2Q1MDMzZDg2N2Qy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia raised a hand slowly, pointing at a space between the wall and a display case.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjZhNDdkZDY1YTRlMTE5YjEyODIyZGU0NjMzYjNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In that space… a man is hiding.”</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Sixty-Three: Noburu's Experience</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMxN2IzNWVmYWY5MTQzZDE5MGJmZjA0YWU0YTk2NTU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Noburu POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/noburu.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWQ3YWJkNWJkMDQ5MDhhOTU4ZGJkODM3YTRjMGY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time for Noburu to finish the job. He and Seonmi made their final plans in their rented accommodation. Their charisma and skills had paid off; not only had they gotten an impression of the key they needed, which they used to create a replica via a contact Seonmi knew, but they also managed to identify the exact box containing the target artefact.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTQ2N2U3NjZiMzQyMDE4NGMwM2RhMzBmNTJhYTFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Why would a pair of old daggers be worth so much, anyway?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjM4ZGM2NTM4NDRlYTc4MzczMmMxMTA4ZDJjZjYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure your ability can last?” Seonmi asked, blinking at him with her brilliant blood-orange eyes. “It’ll take at least ten minutes. Every breath you take will exhaust you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjI2ZmY0MTY0MTQxZWY5N2VjNTQ1MjZmMmRiZDlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s easier in the city. I’ll manage it,” Noburu affirmed. He’d tested his blessing enough to know it was mostly the presence of the ghost plants that exhausted him. Down in the slums, the ghostworld was full of ethereal plant life, but up here in the city, it was less present. Something about demon activity and the presence of aetherlights discouraged their spread. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWNlNjE0ZWY1ZjQ4MmFhMTg5NGY5ZGY0MTFkZTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They reviewed their plan one more time, and then, with the chiming of the midnight bell, it was time.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTczNjg0OWUxNTRjOTg5NmExNGZjYzhiYzI4MDYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu slipped out and made his way to an alleyway near the academy. He took a few deep breaths and one final one before activating his blessing. With a loud snap and a subtle jerking sensation, Noburu was again within the ghostworld.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGQ4Y2RhOWVmZjRjYWViNTA3ZjU0OTBkZDQwNWE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The alleyway was full of semi-translucent plant life, so Noburu quickly exited to the main street where there was none. The aetherlights in the lamposts lining the street didn’t shine in the ghostworld, but they did give off soft bursts of vivid colours as if celebrating his arrival. The sepia world gave him a sense of comfort. Here, no one could find him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTQyZTc5ZDVjNTQ2YjQ5NzgyZmFlZGRhNjZjYTAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He glanced up, comforting himself in the glow of the blue moon. The moon was crisscrossed with geological activity in the real world, but in the ghostworld, it was perfectly smooth and uniform in colour. Sometimes, if he looked at it for long enough, Noburu’s eyes would begin playing tricks, and he would see strange shadows appear across its surface.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWI3YWRlODcwNDQwZjNiMWJjZmZkNWEwNWM5ZmQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now wasn’t the time for moon gazing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWFhMWMxZTUzZDQyM2U4MGQ1ZDBiZDhlYmRiNTRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu strode quickly to the academy gates. They were closed. He climbed them as his lungs began to protest. It was difficult to affect real-world objects from within the ghost world. If he tried, only a small amount of force could be transferred into the real world. Even as he climbed aggressively and dropped down the other side of the academy's gates, they would wobble only slightly to a real-world onlooker.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmJlNzQ0Nzg1ZjRhYjg4MmI0OWRhYTQwZGU5MDhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The gate guards didn’t notice a thing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmU1YTBlYmFhYzQ1NDc5MjE3OGFkMmQxYWE0ZDg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">His lungs were burning. Noburu gasped, taking another breath. To his left and right, the academy’s gardens and forested areas were overlaid with a jungle of ghostly flora. In front of him, the main path, where students and staff walked dozens of times a day, was largely empty of alien plant life. Only a few weed-like plants flourished between the stones; their semi-translucent leaves waved rhythmically to a wind Noburu couldn’t feel.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWEzOGQ1ZWQ4ZDRhZDM4ZmJlNjlmMTE2ZDA2OWI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A guard patrol was near to his left. Something about the guards seemed more </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">colourful</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> than how people typically looked in the ghostworld. Was it because they were warriors with experience in using aether? Yasuji, the guard who demanded protection money every month, didn’t seem anywhere near as colourful in the ghost world as these academy guards.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2Q0YTU1MTEyNDRiOTY5MDE1NWRjZjg0ZmE4MzRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That man was surely lying about being an aura-user.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjVhYWNmYmZiNzQ2ZjFiNmIyYTQ2YWE3YjUyNTE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took Noburu a few more breaths to reach the academy doors, where four guards stood, each with varying levels of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">colour</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was nerve-wracking to sneak between them. Noburu had verified people could feel him in the other world, even if the tactile feedback was minimal. Unlike the ghost plants that could move </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">through</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> someone, Noburu found he couldn’t do that.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjZmYjMxNGVjZDRjOGM4MDJmZjI3Nzg5MTQzYmMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If he could, what would happen if he exited the ghostworld while moving through someone?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmU4OTJlZTgxYjQ1YWU5ZmI3NDE3MDZjMTdjMGZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Making it through, Noburu walked into the academy, down the main throughway, as far as he could before taking another deep breath. Unlike the real world, where pacing yourself and controlling your breathing would make logical sense, in the ghostworld, he became exhausted quickly when using that method. For some reason, when he took a large breath here, he could hold it far longer than the real world.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmI1NjFhYmNjNTQ3YTQ5NTM5ZjIzNmI2YWI3MzYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Navigating through the corridors, Noburu traced the learned route he’d previously travelled only twice. Reaching the storage room, Noburu took out the key. Placing it in the lock, he gritted his teeth and used both hands to put as much torque as possible into the key. Only a tiny amount of force transferred between the two worlds, so it took all his strength to get the lock to disengage. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmU3ZmJmNjczMjQwODA5NjFjMWNiYmE2YWRjNWQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu could bring items into the ghostworld when he activated his blessing, but those items, like himself, struggled to affect the real world. It was disappointing that it worked like that. Otherwise, he would probably have swung a metal bar at Yasuji’s head by now.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWUxZjM4N2Y2NzQ4NTM4ZjQyM2ZiMDlmOTFhMGIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the door open, Noburu removed the key and placed it in a pocket. Taking another breath, he began to shoulder barge the door. Even using his full weight, it took half a dozen attempts, aimed at the furthest part from the door’s hinges, for it to begin to move. Elated, he continued his efforts, building on his created momentum until the door was opened enough for him to slip through.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTZkYzA4NTFlYzRiMTdhMmUyMWQxYjQ1Y2Q3Y2M0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Another breath, and he started to feel the telltale signs of exhaustion. The throbbing in his head. The pressure in his chest. Thankfully, the academy was empty of ghostly, energy-draining flora. If he were surrounded by plant life, he would have collapsed by now.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWE0YzA5MzJkZTQxYzZiMDU3YWRhYmZmZjE5M2Rl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With tremendous effort, he was able to close the door from the other side. The physical exertion didn’t help, and Noburu took even more breaths in the progress, further tiring himself.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmQwYWI3NjQwODQ1YmZiMjc2ZjgzYjRhYTA3NDMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He made his way down the steps to the storage room. The aetherlights were turned off, but Noburu could still see well enough. Darkness didn’t exist in the ghost world; everything was lit under the same neutral sepia tones - even if it was an enclosed basement.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTY0YjMxM2JkODQyZjc5MmZiNWYwMDIyY2Y1MjE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He made his way to the section near where they’d been working earlier that day. It was the period covering the Three Sisters’ War in the early fourth century. It was in this section that Seonmi charmed the archivist, Takumi, into showing her weapons. Incredibly, the daggers they’d been contracted to steal were discovered almost immediately.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjM1MzgwNTYzNTQzNjk4Y2Q5YzkyOWNjMmE1Mjc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A lucky sign, surely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjE0NjZhZWQ5NDQwNWI4MTU4MzlmZjRhOWIwYjM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at that very same box, Noburu resisted a sigh. There was no way to get access to it in the ghost world. The box was nestled between others on a shelf, sitting about shoulder height. Even using his full weight, he wouldn’t be able to get it off the shelf. It was frustrating but not unexpected, and there was a simple solution.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWU3YWUzNWZmNTQ5NThiZGI0NTU1ZjdkMDZiN2Ux" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Releasing his blessing, Noburu returned to the real world with a snap.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzViZDNiMzU2OTQ4ODlhNWQ3ODMyZTE2YzZjMTMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was pitch black in the real world, and the familiar smell of burning toast lingered in the air. Noburu was forced to wait thirty seconds until his demon eyes adapted to the darkness. As he did so, he felt hunger building. He wasn’t ravenous, but he would need to eat something relatively soon. The pressure in his head and chest eased slightly, but he wouldn’t have the luxury of waiting to be fully recovered. Who knew if an academy guard heard the mysterious snapping sound and was on their way now?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWUyZmZhOWVhNDQyZDE4YTc0OGYyMzRkOTFiNWUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took Noburu another thirty seconds to pull down the box, open it, and bundle the pair of daggers in cloth. Then, he closed the box and placed it back on the shelf. This way, no one would discover any theft until the box was opened again. Sure, the restorationists' disappearance after a single day of work might seem suspicious, and if they investigated, they would find that their identification and travel documents were forged, but by then, they would be long gone.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjE0YjIwNTIwNDRkM2JiY2I4YWY5YWY4ZmU3OGI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No one would look for them in Asamaywa’s shadow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGFmZjgzNjMwZDQzZjdhYzZhOTg1NmY3OTRlYTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu took a few deep breaths and, with a grimace, activated his blessing and snapped into the ghostworld. Doing it again so quickly carried its toll - the headache and pressure increased dramatically. It didn’t help he was bringing the pair of daggers in with him. Bringing in items took far more energy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDQ0YzY1YjcyZDRiOGRiZmY4MmExNzdlOWEzY2U4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He should still be fine.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDY5NWQ4NTcyMTQ1NGQ4OTRlY2M4NTZjMzM3NTgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu came to the steps of the storage room, looking up at the closed door. He somewhat regretted closing it, but he did so to prevent any passing guard from noticing the open door. Now, he had to open it again.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDJjZGNmZTBhYzRmMWQ5NDc0MTFkZDQ5ZGMyYTgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After he’d done so, the pressure in his chest intensified. The throbbing pain in his head became sharp and distracting. As he closed the door and finished the mighty effort of locking it again with the key, Noburu wanted to throw up. Would he be able to leave the grounds? Get back to the alley?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDdkY2NhZDZkNDQyN2M5NDYxOGY5NzUxY2M1ZGE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He would have to.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjg5MjQ1Mzc0YjRiZThiMjMxOTJhNWVmMzA2MWU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He took another breath, this one harder than before, and began making his way out of the academy. Turning a corner, he retraced his steps in his mind. He was in the left wing and just needed to navigate to the main throughway, and then it was a straight line to-</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTZjMWY5NjAzMjQ2YjE4NzZkMjJhZTg3MjQxNjc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a woman in front of him.</span></p><span class="cjU1MmY0N2U3NDYwOTRjYjY5ODkzZmJmY2FhZDc1Njg4"><br/>Support the creativity of authors by visiting the original site for this novel and more.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM2YTRhMWZmMzQ3OTRjMzJhOWY2N2E1YTcyZDJiZTIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">All thoughts suddenly tumbled out of his head, clearing his mind. No longer did he feel the sharp pain of his headache or the burning pressure in his chest. His mind had thrown a cold bucket of water over everything as his adrenaline surged and redirected every mental process to one terrible, horrible, unavoidable fact.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTNhMzRiM2UwMzQ3ZWM4MjJjYjZhZjg4OGE0ZGIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a woman in front of him.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjI0Y2FlMWU1ZjRlMzQ4ZTkxNjY2OTYwZWVhMWE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not in the real world, where Noburu could walk around or otherwise avoid her. She was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Noburu had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">never</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> seen another person in the ghostworld. He’d thought he was the only one!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTc5ZmVjNzJkYzQyOThhNjQxNzBhMTUyN2ExZTFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was looking at him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2UwM2MyY2U4NzRhYzI5ZWUzYjc0NjUyNGUwMjNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Every instinct screamed for him to run, yet he couldn’t move. One part of his mind, the rational part, raised a question that bore through his adrenaline-fuelled brain, blocking his fight-or-flight instincts.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWY5YjdmMDg2ZjQ5ZDA4NDI4ZDI1ZmE4ZTg2ZGU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did she look like a maid?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWNjZTJkOTMwOTQ2ZmI5NWQ4MTU1NzFmZDAzMDAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He tried to think of something to say. A set of words that could benefit him. A string of lies that would get him out of this situation. He opened his mouth, but the woman dressed as a maid spoke first.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDQ3MjI2YTYzNjRlNzM4NDUzZTlmYmVmYWM1Y2Rh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mistwalker. Identify yourself, otherwise…” The woman thrust her hand to the side, where a sinister-looking spear </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">manifested</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> itself from nothing. At first, it was semi-translucent similar to the ghostly plants, until it solidified into something very </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">real</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. “...you’ll die,” the woman finished, tilting her head slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjI3NjZhYTZjZDQzYTU4MWVjMWYwN2Q4OGUxYWM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Enough thinking. Noburu turned and ran.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWI2YjUzMGEwYzQ3YzRhMGU1NTgzNDYzNTE5NWMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...What?” He heard the woman behind him mutter in confusion as if she didn’t expect his choice of action.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTc1MzQ1NWM2MDQzMjBhNWY5ZmJlMjFiOGUwNTI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Good. Let her be confused until the moons fall! Noburu didn’t know who that woman was or why she was there. What he did know was that she seemed completely comfortable in the ghostworld and called him a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mistwalker</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She obviously knew far more about this place than he did, and she was evidently </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hostile</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTIyNjYwNWIyNjQ4YzQ5OGFjZmUwODY0MmRjZWNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu could scrap well enough; he’d gotten into plenty of fights over the years in the slums.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmEyNGJlY2UzZDRhZGU4MmNkYTEwYzI2NGQ2YjA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But not in a ghostly world that drained his energy with every breath.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWM1ZmNiZDgyMDRkNmJiOGMzMjljYWQwZWQ5OGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He sprinted down the hallway, his body reflexively tensing as if, at any moment, that spear would be plunged through, ending his sorry life. He didn’t think he would make it to the corner, but somehow he did. What was she doing? As he turned the corner, Noburu glanced to his side and down the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmNlM2VlMTA1YzQwNGViNWMyNDAwNmFiOTRiNDdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, moons! She’d begun to run after him! And she still had that spear!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmYzNDU3OGU5OTRjNmZhNjIyMzcxMTgyOWY2ZWI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu poured everything into his legs. He took huge breaths, ignoring the growing exhaustion that was setting in, overriding the adrenaline. He turned another corner, then another. He eventually came across a passage he recognised! Thank the Empress! Ahead, he just needed to turn left into the main throughway, and then it was a straight line to the academy’s doors! He could outrun this woman! He could-</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2UxMjYxMThmZjQxMTA5Y2ZiN2IyODhhMWQ5NzEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re too weak to be an assassin, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWMyNTgzOTAwYzQ1MzE5MWJmN2RhYmVmMmZiNzFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The cool, cold voice in his ear made him scream. How did she get right next to him!? His feet tangled, and he crashed into the floor, bouncing until he slammed between a cabinet and a wall. Damn it! He’d made it to the main throughway! He could see the gates from here! Two students were walking towards him! Should he leave the ghostworld and beg for help? What if the woman with the spear followed him to the real world?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTJhMTVmM2NhZDQ5OTU4MjkyMTc5ZWVlMGE2Y2M4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He turned back to find the maid had stopped. She was frowning, looking awkwardly at the wall next to her. No, she wasn’t looking at the wall. She was looking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">through </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">it at the two students around the corner and down the hallway coming their way. How could she sense them through the wall? Her eyes snapped back to Noburu, and he grew cold under her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDMyMjc2ZjE4MzRjNjFiODU5ZWNmYzc4YTFkNTAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t be seen, but I can still kill you from here, vile interloper.” The woman raised her spear, poised to throw it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjU1NDkzYzBlZDQwYmY4MzNiODRhNDFmODU4N2Fl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait!” Noburu hastily climbed to his feet. “This is a misunderstanding!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWNhMWJlNzhlNTRiMmU5YjA3ZTk4YmVjOTJiZDMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, another voice spoke out. The slower passage of time in the real world made it muffled and quiet, but somehow, it still sounded sweet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjQ4YWRiZDg0NjRjY2Y5ZTQ0MTY1YjhkZjYxZWFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In that space… a man is hiding.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjg2ZjY5MWY1YTQwZmI5ZTk1Yzk1ZjRiNWZjZTkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu turned his head to see one of the students - no, she wasn’t a student, she wore an instructor's uniform - with shining crimson eyes. She was pointing and glaring </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">at</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> him. She could see him!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzMyZGFjZmJkNDRhMzY4NjgxMjNhOTEwNDcyYTgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Where were all these women coming from!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzY5NDIzNjk3MTQxZDQ4ZDUyZjFiZjQ0NmY2OGQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk!” The maid began to move, throwing her spear.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTkzMjY0MzI0OTQyY2Q5OWVhNTQ5ZWI1YzZmOGMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Raw panic filled his body as he raised his arms to defend himself against the incoming death. His mind filled with the image of the spear moving through the air, coming to end his life. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWFjZjFiYWYwNDQ0YWRhOWVhYWYzMmQyYTljMWFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!” he yelled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjA0NTU4YWE1MDRhMGViZmU1N2NlZDhiZTdjZDA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, nothing. He wasn’t dead. The spear hadn’t reached him. The maid was gone.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjkyMWRiODJjYTRmZGQ4ZjMzYTVmZTU3YjgwNjIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He’d reflexively deactivated his blessing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTcyMDYxODcwMTQxODVhM2UxNjdlYmY5YTZkODNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu was back in the real world!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzY5MjMzZjBlYTRmYWQ4Mzg3MjQwNGEzYzQ1NDc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He didn’t hesitate. Who knew when that maid was going to exit the ghostworld and attack? Noburu turned, gathering the last of his strength, and began running down the hallway, away from where the maid was and the instructor who could see him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2QwM2ZiNGI2ZjQxMWY5ZjJkOGQ2MDgwMjIyMWIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Only to crash into a shimmering wall that sent him crumpling to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Mjg3YzQ0ZDdjNzQ1ZTZhYTRlMTQwODY3NzVkZjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-an assassin!” The instructor cried out, pointing directly at him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYThiYWQ2MmQ2NzQ2Yzk4OTFlNjk3OGViN2QyOTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No! Please!” Noburu yelled, frantically pointing to the spot where the maid was. “There’s-” he continued before stopping. No, the maid could be anywhere by now. Didn’t she say she couldn’t be seen? She might kill not only Noburu but this instructor and her student as well!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWU4MGE5NTE5NzRkYTBiMjg0OTIxZmEwNWQzMmQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where did she go?” Noburu frantically asked. If this golden-haired instructor could see him in the ghostworld, she might also be able to see the maid! “Be careful!” His mind was exhausted. His head pounded, and his body felt like it was going to rip itself apart. Only adrenaline was keeping him going. “She could appear at any-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmJhMDVhMTk4OTRlMjBiYjQ3MzRlZjBmOWVhODA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hrmph!” The instructor declared, cracking her knuckles. Focusing in on the sound, only now could Noburu see this instructor properly. Judging from her crimson eyes and golden hair, he had thought she was a Samino demon with some Cerulean heritage, but now he saw the truth. She had no horns sprouting from her head!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWM3MWU1MGIyNjRkMjM4MzhmM2QyMjJlMDVjOThh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a human!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDVmNmY2Njc5NzRlZTY4YTBhYjA5YThiNjBkOGEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice ploy, assassin!” the human triumphantly declared. “What are those daggers for? Cutting my steak!? Admit it, you’re here to finish the job, aren’t you!? They must have been desperate to send someone capable of entering the Shimmer! Don’t even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">think</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> about Speaking!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjg2Zjk2YWZlMDQ1YWU5YjE2NjY2OWQ2MTVlYTU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What in the seven hells was this human talking about!?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDUzZWIzNDM4MTQ3NGZhNGMzMTlkN2RiOTE2MmRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!” Noburu protested. “You got it wrong! There’s a maid-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzA5ZTQ1MTBlNjRmNThhMjc3MmRlOTkyNzc5YThl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Silence!” the human interrupted. She turned her head, looking at the student next to her. Noburu, despite being exhausted, followed her gaze. This student was a demon, visibly glowing with orange hues that danced along her skin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzZkMWNmOGQzMDQzMmI5MjhmNjk2Yzc4MDViOTlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">So that’s what aura looks like</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, he thought. He’d seen it from a distance earlier that day, but being this close, he could see how beautiful it was.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODBhMzNiNTM3MzRlYjI5YTEwYTcxMGY4NWUwZDY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“See!?” the human instructor exclaimed to the student, her voice dripping with glee.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWM0ODhhODY2YjQyODViYjBiYzVhZDIwNTFkNDBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what?” the student replied, keeping her eyes on Noburu. The student moved to a nearby wall and pulled off one of the display swords, pointing it at Noburu. As she did, her aura seemed to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">crawl</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> up the sword, coating it in the same shimmering light as her body.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGYyMzJiYzE2ZDRmOTE5MTFmYWQ5NTBlMDQzZWVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I caught one!” the human exclaimed, throwing a thumbs up towards the student.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTAwYmMzYjlhYTQxMDRiOTRiZWVjNzI0ODQzNTQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I caught an assassin!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDk3NjQxYzgzOTQxNTBhNzdjMDQ1NjNiYzE4ODJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia…” the student tentatively began, not moving her eyes from Noburu. “I’m not sure he’s an assassin.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWY0NGE2MDhhODRkOWZhODdhYjNkYTI3NGViYWRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not! I’m not an assassin! I’m…” Noburu trailed off. What could he say? He usually had a talent for using his words to escape a tight situation, but now, his mind wasn’t working after everything. Damn it! He was starting to feel ravenous. He would collapse soon if he didn’t eat something.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTdiNzBmOWFmZjQyZjE4ZDU4MmZkZjExZGQxNDY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-are you sure?” Amelia asked, peering closely at Noburu. “I suppose he isn’t dressed like the last one.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzUyM2I5NDgwMjQ3MDU4MzliN2M0NDg2OGIwMjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Last one?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODY1NWU0MTk4ZDQ3MjY4ZmE0Y2Y3ZjVlZWQ1ZTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And…” the student pointed at the daggers that had fallen to the ground. “Those look like they’ll break if they were used. I don’t see any actual weapons. I think…” her head tilted to the side, a subtle frown forming. “This is a thief.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDMwNTMxNjcwMTQxNDc4NGM0MzZmYzFhZjEwYWU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A thief!?” Amelia’s mouth opened in awe. “Now I look at him properly, he’s not a Speaker, is he? Hell, he isn’t even a mage! I don’t think…” She trailed off, raising a finger to her chin in thought. “Then how was he in the Shimmer…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzU2ZDZhZWRhZTQ4YWNiYWEyMGVjZDEyY2I5NWYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Shimmer? Was that what she called the ghostworld?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGY4MTBjYTUwOTRiMTdhMmMzNWQxNmM0NzAwYzA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There was someone else in the… the Shimmer!” Noburu shouted. He waved his arm to try and gesture, but it collided with the shimmering walls that were boxing him in. “I wasn’t lying! You could see me, right? There’s a woman! Dressed like a maid! She was…. She was hunting me! She might appear at any time! Keep an eye out! She’s dangerous!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmM0M2NkODU1OTRiMDc5MzY4MzVjMjVjMTQ1MWMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Amelia’s crimson eyes flashed with some kind of energy. She turned slowly on the spot. “I don’t see anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTg0Mjc5MTkzYjQ4MjFiOTI1NzMzMWRkZTg1Mzk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A maid?” the student questioned, a deep frown on her forehead. “Why does that feel so familiar?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDc1Mzc1YTVhNzQ3MGQ5M2M5Yzc1ZDUwZjBmNGZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look! I’m a victim here!” Noburu declared, finding the strength in his voice. “I just came here to get some work done! I’m not a bad person! I didn’t hurt anyone! Please, let me go home! I have children to look after!” There was a chance this approach might work. A minute chance. Humans were easily manipulated, weren’t they? If he could get this instructor to just let him go…</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODNkNWE1YzMzZjQyZjc5NjU3NGVkNjQ4Nzg2NDk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm! I believe you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDZlYTc5ZWI1OTQ2NDA4MTI2ZDMxNTk1ZjAxOGMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What! That easily!?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmYwM2I5ODczOTRmMWZhYmVkYmI2NjBiYjhiYTYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve got good intuition on these things, you see. However!” The human called Amelia pointed dramatically at him. “I’ve already gone through something like this before, and…” Her eyes suddenly looked sad. “...I’ve come to understand that even good people can do bad things under the wrong conditions.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTI4Nzg2NzUyZDQ3Njk4MjU2ZGM1ZWVlYzA5YzQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait…” Noburu protested.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGZhMmIzNTRhYjQ5YjVhNDIwNGY1ODIxNzJkY2Mz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So,” Amelia continued. The human turned and waved to the door guards already descending the hallway. Amelia turned back, her golden hair waving. “I’m going to capture you, alright? I’ve already been involved in enough situations here, and I want to wait at least </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, no, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">two</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> weeks before getting into another! Understand?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGIzNWY1MDZiNDQ3Mjc4YzNmY2FjODc5YzU2NmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Those crimson eyes twinkled, and Noburu panicked. He tried to activate his blessing but found he couldn’t. He was too exhausted. Then, something colourful erupted from the woman, striking and then sinking into Noburu’s body.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDNmMjQyMTgyZTQ0OTM4MTZjOTZlY2VkNTYxN2U5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Magic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, he thought, as his eyelids forcefully closed and an unnatural sleep engulfed his mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDYwOTUwOTBlZDQwNGU5OTYyNmQwZmNhODZlODNh" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kiku… I should have listened to you…</span></em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNlNWRlMjQ0MDZmNzQ4NWI5ZTRmMmE5NzQ5MWM4ODQ1"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNmOTUxMDA4MGJlYTQwMDQ5NmIwM2M4NGQ4NDY0ZDY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Old Guard Headquarters was as imposing as it was boring. Its roof was flat, absent Eastern architecture’s characteristic sweeping rooftops. Nor did it have any decorative statues or inlays. All to prevent the possibility of someone climbing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODA0YzdkOTJlMDRlNDJhNjhkMThhMmU3NWJlZjBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At first glance, the facade appeared plain, built with plaster and wood beams. However, Serena knew from prior visits that the outside walls were more than a foot thick and packed with special material designed to block sound—a simple solution to prevent any enhanced ears from eavesdropping on any inside investigations from outside the building.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGExZGFiM2UxOTRmMDc5MmRhZWUwNTFmNTRmNWIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In a similar vein, the building had no windows. Unlike normal Samino architecture, where paper windows were common, the flat walls of the headquarters seemed oppressive. It was a building that told you that you weren’t welcome. Can’t listen in, can’t look in. Hells, if you loitered around outside for more than a moment, someone would come outside and find out who you were.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzE0ZTM5OTVlMTQ5YjJhZGNmODM5MmMxZDUyNzg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which was what happened now.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmRiNjUyNjFjMjQyNmVhYWQ3Zjc5ODBlZGJiMjBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Halen!” a demon in plainclothes stepped outside the front door, bowing in greeting. “I’m Detective Minato. We’ve been expecting you. Please.” He opened the door, signalling for Serena to enter.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2FhZDdlNGQ5NzRkNDE4YzM5NjRhY2E4YzNiOGZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t hesitate, striding past the detective and into the building. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTJjMWJkYTI5OTRhZjg5NjM0YjVlYzUwN2IzNjdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As a Cascadian Lord, Serena had no obligation to go along with anything the Old Guard asked; they had no jurisdiction over her. Still, the missive that had arrived via aethergram early that morning was from the Office of Greatlord Oshiro, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">he</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was a demon Serena respected and obeyed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmY3MGZlNDk1ODQ2NDRiNTQ3YmYzN2QzNjE5YTI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The message was sparse with information, mentioning that Lord-Prospect Thornheart prevented a thief from escaping the academy the previous night and that Serena was to appear at the Old Guard Headquarters as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzBmYjJhZjYyOTQ0ZjJiZGFjODY5ZTVkN2U1MzI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d dressed herself in her military uniform and left immediately. By now, she’d become sensitive enough to Amelia’s aether that she could roughly tell the direction and distance of where the woman was. When she checked the aetherflow that morning, it pointed in the same direction she was summoned towards.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2YzYWI0ZDEyZDQ1MGM4Y2Y2YjM2ZGI5YjgzNzEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia was already inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWQ4NTFhODQ2NjRlZGQ4NGQ5MmE5ODk4NWEwNDIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s this about?” Serena asked the detective the moment the door closed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzBjODZmMDMzYzRlMGY5NTkzMDI3NjIyYjg5ZmZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Honestly, Lord Halen, I’m not too sure. A few hours ago, it was a simple case of a bold thief. Lord-Prospect Thornheart captured the suspect in the academy, aided by a trainee officer called…” The detective frowned, his eyes flicking to the right as he tried to remember.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzIzN2M0ZDFiYjQ4NTliYTUyNzc1ODQ5MTFkYzJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Melanie Mori?” Serena suggested dryly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDc5Y2VkNTEzMDQ2MTE4MzVjMDgxNThmODQ1NGUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right. So you’re acquainted.” He nodded before gesturing further into the building. “May we walk and talk?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjNiOTk5ZTg1NDQwNmZhYWYyYzNhNDNiODY0ZTUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We may.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmNlOGIzNzEyYjRkNzNhYTczNjk1MTY2YjIxYzgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The pair of them walked through the headquarters. Dozens of administrative members of the Old Guard were moving back and forth, carrying about their duties. All in all, they seemed rather busy. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2JhYWY3ZWUyYTQxNzM4OGRmZjVkMDNjMWVjMTQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s always like this before, during and just after the coming moonrain,” Detective Minato explained as if reading her mind. “Organised crime uses the moonrain as cover for smuggling and other illicit activities, not to mention the common criminals and opportunists. We’re up to our horns in work, so I’m so glad this theft case is being taken from us.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjJmYjhiNDgxZDQxNWY4MmUyNTQ4MTkwZDc5Nzg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Taken from you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjEzMmRiMjFkZjQ0YWY4Njk1ZDQ0NGJkYzIzN2I4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s correct, Lord Halen,” the detective nodded. “This is why I said I’m not sure about the full extent of this case. Shortly after taking in the thief, we were about to wake and interrogate him before Grandmaster Shun and some big horn from Intelligence came in and demanded we stop. Apparently, it’s now an Imperial investigation. Really, I’m just here to take you to them. I’m not even allowed in anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTllOWZlYzgxMTRiZDNhM2U2ODBhOWFiYjEzYzNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…” Serena trailed off. An Imperial investigation? How had Amelia stumbled into that? Or had the Imperial investigators taken over </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">because</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia was involved?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjI3MGFhYWZhYjQxZjM4YTEwNjJkNTk5NDRjNTBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They continued down several flights of stairs and through a maze of corridors before stopping before a door flanked by two guards. Serena’s sense of Amelia’s aetherflow was strong. She was undoubtedly just beyond this door, along with another signature of whom she was sure was the grandmaster. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjAxOGJhMDg5MTQ0MGQ4N2RmMjU4MjQxZTI5MGZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll be off then, pleasure meeting you, Lord Halen,” Detective Minato bowed and explained where she could find the washroom or meal before vanishing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDc0NTBjOTYwYTQyOTk5OWE3NmM5ZTM3NzM3ZTAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena watched him go before turning to open the door. She wasn’t fast enough, as it was opened first from the other side. Serena was treated to a familiar sight and smell. Despite the seriousness of the situation, the cheerful expression she was faced with caused her to smile reflexively.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjFiYTk0MTQ1YzQzOThiYWIyNjA2ZTBmN2MyNjhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t have much self-control around her, did she? Once, she would see that as a weakness. Now, she enjoyed it, even if her stress-induced horn-clutching increased.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDRhNWE2Y2MwZTRlY2JiM2U3YmJkYzhlZTZmYzE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello!” Amelia chirped. “I caught a thief!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjUxMjljZDRjOTQ2MWY5ZGQ3OTdlZWVmZGZlNjBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Congratulations,” Serena answered, resisting the urge to ruffle Amelia’s hair. Honestly, she looked so proud of herself, like a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">peeka</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> who caught its first mouse and brought it back to its owner. “I see I’m not the only one here to celebrate your achievement,” Serena said, peering past Amelia and looking at the other figures within the dimly lit room. There stood the grandmaster, who, judging by the fragrance, was politely sipping mint tea with another man Serena couldn’t sense.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTdhYjI4NmQ1NjQ5ZTI4OGUxNDU2ZGIwNmM1ZTc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grandmaster,” Serena intoned with a firm bow before straightening and locking eyes with the other man in the room. “Chesterfield,” she nodded, offering a smaller bow. The mysterious big-horn raised his cup of mint tea in greeting before taking a slow sip.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjc1OWJkNDkwODRmNzQ4Njg3YjMxN2I4NWQ4ODg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Halen, always a pleasure,” he smoothly replied, placing his teacup on its saucer. As usual, Serena detected no spellwork or aether around the man. He seemed entirely ordinary, even though her instincts screamed he wasn’t. “I didn’t expect to see you again so soon. Come to join our little tea party?” He waved towards a side table with a steaming pot.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDM5NmRlN2NjNTQ3YTVhMzA2ZTY3OGI2NTg2MmVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Thank you,” Serena said. She poured herself a cup, holding it in her hand. The room was long, rectangular and painted grey, with dark furnishings and one side almost entirely windowed. Not paper windows, but thick glass. Walking up to the two demons, she realised they were on a raised observation deck looking down into a room where an unconscious demon lay. A female mage sat near the man, her eyes closed as she focused on her spell.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWYwZDViMmJmMDQ1MTliMDAyNWYxMzQyN2VkMWU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Keeping him asleep?” Serena asked, then before anyone could answer, she added, “This isn’t any normal thief, is he?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzczNDJjZWUyZTQ5OTNiMmY2MTdkN2FiODhiNWVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Correct,” answered Chesterfield.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzc2ZDVjOGFkNzRkNTJhYTFhY2EzMDg1ZTQ1ZTk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He has a blessing!” Amelia chirped. “A really interesting one!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzAwMTQ5YzMyYzQxZDI5MTk5MmI4OTY2ZWIxYzA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before that,” grumbled the grandmaster. “We’re keeping this quiet. If it gets out that this academy cannot stop </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">both</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> assassins and lowborn thieves, then we’ll be mocked from across the Empire.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDkwYzJmMmVmMjQ1NGRhMzRiYmE2MDY1OGI2ZGVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The student Melanie Mori has already signed a vow of secrecy, as have the guards involved in the matter,” Chesterfield explained. “Grandmaster Shun will keep this from the rest of the academy staff. These thieves impersonated restorationists to steal an artefact from the academy’s storage. As far as the archivist Takumi and department head, Noel Yamaguchi, will be concerned, they were called away on an emergency task for one of the Fengra Lords.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTBkOTcxNDczODQ4ZmQ4MTZiNDFlMTg3YWNjNDk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thieves?” Serena asked, raising an eyebrow at the wording.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTMyMWNjN2FiNTQ0NDI5OGMyYjZhY2NlMTM1NDc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have a look,” Chesterfield walked down the observation deck, and Serena followed. The long room they were in spanned several interrogation rooms below, each partitioned by a thick wall. In the next room over, Serena looked down through the window and saw a female demon sitting at the singular table. She was bent over, clutching her horns.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTMzZmFmODZhNjQyMTE4MDQ4OGNlYmUzMzhjNjdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, someone else who knows my suffering,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena thought with amusement. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">How much time did you spend around my girlfriend for you to start doing that?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhODc1OWRmZDk4MjQ2OWI4MzVhNDIxMGYxY2VlNjU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who’s that?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDM4ZjczZTRiMjRjM2Y5MjMzNTgyNDk2OTI4ZjY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seonmi San,” Chesterfield said. “Confidence trickster that’s been implicated in more than a few events that have greatly embarrassed and lightened the bank accounts of the local highborn. Apparently, the Old Guard here have been aware of her for some time, but she’s always slipped away.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWVmZjQxMjY3NjQxMjNiMWRjNGMwYTE3OWYyOGVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How was she caught?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGMxNGU0ZmI1MzQyNjA5Y2NjNDI5NmMwMTEzMzU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Imperial trackers.” Chesterfield looked up, blinking twice. “I found out about this situation six hours ago. Caught her… four hours ago. She was hiding in some den in the slums. It’s no wonder she escaped the authority's grasp for so long if that’s where she was hiding.” He looked down at Seonmi, who was now looking around the room, stress visible on her face. “We’re letting her simmer in her own thoughts for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmZmMWNmOWVmMjRlZGJhYzViZjM4NjA1NThiMDlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, so Amelia caught the man, and trackers hunted the woman, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, she’s quite pretty for a criminal.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNmNzY1NzRkMzRiZTQyY2FhYzgwOTE5MjljMjg1N2M4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"> Seeing the woman’s looks, she could understand how she could pull off a confidence trick against the wealthy and foolish. Her horns, which had a thick Manwese base but ended in a characteristic Fengra twist, would make her an exotic sight for the men.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWY4NmVmYTEyMzRkY2U5OTJjNDJhNDUyMzkyNzg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She can’t seem to see us, can she?” Serena asked. Despite Seonmi’s eyes passing over them, she didn’t seem aware they were there.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2Y0YTcxYmZlYTQ1YzNhZjFmNDdiNjk2YjUxMzY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One-way glass,” Chesterfield explained. “Invented in Centralis a few years back. We can see through the window, but it looks like a mirror to the people down below. As long as we keep that room brightly lit and this room dim, the illusion works, so don’t go turning the aetherlights up. It’s why all the furnishings in this room are dark - to absorb the light. It won’t fool anyone here, or any half-decent warrior or mage, but our thieves there don’t have that capability.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDY0Y2UxNDVmZjQ0ZTM4MDAwMDU3NmIxMjIyYThl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And this one?” Serena nodded towards the captured woman. “Does she also have a blessing?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGI0ZjFiY2Y4MTRkMzg5MDI5ZThkMmYwNDY5M2Jm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No…” Chesterfield took a deliberate sip of his mint tea. “She’s special for a different reason. We’ll go over that when Greatlord Oshiro arrives.” He strode back down the observation deck to the sleep-induced demon. “This is our main prize.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjQyMmI0OTA5MzRlMTZhNTU5OTQ3YWViN2ZmOWIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Our?” Serena narrowed her eyes. “What has this got to do with me? If you wanted to keep this secret, why am I involved in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjRjYzQ2OTc2MzRkMTBhY2I4YzllMjY1ZWZkN2Rk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The moment word filtered up that there was a blessing involved, we made the decision to include as few people as possible,” Chesterfield explained. “As for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">why</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you’re </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Lord Halen.” He raised a finger. “One, the nature of the blessing, as described by Lord-Prospect Thornheart, meant your involvement has become inevitable. This thief has a very unique blessing that is as rare as a truth-teller and is related to Lord-Prospect Thornheart's recent… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">training</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” He glanced at the bubbly human, who was nodding enthusiastically before raising a second finger. “And the second reason…” Chesterfield trailed off with a disheartened sigh.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTJhOTBiZTljNzQ5MDg5NTgwZjUzZjY2YjI2YzZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told them I would tell you anyway!” Amelia blurted out, proudly putting her hands on her hips. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">And</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> I said I wouldn’t sign any secret document unless you read through it with me! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">And</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> I also said anything like that would need an exception so I could tell you anyway!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDI0OTExNjU4YzRiNjBiZjc0MzBhZWM5OGVjNjA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pfft- </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ahem!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Serena coughed quickly to cover her laugh. How she wished she was there to see how much that frustrated Chesterfield. She’d have to have Amelia give her a run-down of what happened after. “I see. Thanks for the explanation. How does this blessing relate to Amelia’s training? Does it affect aura?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmM0ZDg0ZTgyMTRhMGJhMzMyNjVhYTczNDhjZTRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not that kind of training,” the grandmaster said, scratching his nose. “Lord Halen, have you ever heard of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimmer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmMwY2M3MzExMjQ4NzJhMzczZGIyM2NmZGY2N2Fk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Shimmer? Serena scoured her memory. It did ring a faint bell.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Mzk2OGFmNzNjNzQxMGFiMTA0MWY4NjQ5MmQ2Y2U3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The world of… spirits?” she offered, vaguely remembering the childhood stories her father used to read to her. “Don’t tell me it’s…” she glanced at Amelia, who nodded happily.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTA4ZWU0ZmJmNDRjZjhhZGZhNjhjOGIxNzdjM2Ey" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s real!” Amelia declared, glowing with pride. “Lunaria and I have been training our eyes to look into it! I was going to tell you this morning, but then all this happened!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmQ2Y2UxZTBmYTRiYTlhNTIwZjBlMDhhYTdlZTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Shimmer is an aetherphobic mistborne layer of reality,” Chesterfield lectured. “There’s an Empire-wide ban on talking about it publicly, and publishing research on it is heavily restricted. The human nations have taken a similar approach. We, like them, try to maintain control over the Shimmer within our territorial borders.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzM5N2ZiYjk4MjQwZmZhZDEwN2RiNGU1OGRkNTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And his blessing lets him see into it?” Serena cast a look at the sleeping demon.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmE5OTNhMDE3NjQ0ZjU4Zjk1NzBmYTQyMDk4MzU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it lets him </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">travel</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> through it - an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">incredibly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> dangerous activity. He’s called a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mistwalker</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, although I doubt he knows exactly what he is. Given that he isn’t a trained warrior or mage, he likely only has limited access to his blessing. Still, there is a great potential. Time works differently in the Shimmer, you see. A minute </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">there </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">is thirty seconds </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It’s a strategic plane of existence and a core interest of Imperial security. You understand the implications of the time difference, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWE4YWVkYTE2NzQzYWQ5ZWIxMDZhNzJjNTc2NzEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Serena answered. Her mind churned, connecting dots that she’d always wondered about. It was always known that the Empire’s elite strategic reaction forces had secret methods to travel large distances quickly. The existence of the Shimmer and the disparity in the flow of time would explain why. “What about detection?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzk4Nzk1ZTQ2ODQwZDhhMmRlODFhMmYzZWZkYjU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Almost impossible. Perhaps one in five hundred mages can learn to open their perception to it, just like Lord-Prospect Thornheart has done, along with Instructor Inoue.” Chesterfield took a sip of his tea. “The more aether one can cycle or convect, the more likely one is to catch even a glimpse of it. However, we have encountered examples of… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">interactions</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in situations of extreme emotion and desperation. For warriors, one in three thousand.” As Serena glanced at the grandmaster, Chesterfield nodded. “Grandmaster Shun is one of a small number of warriors in the East who have managed it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGU0MWUwMWVhNjRiMDhhOGMwZmEyZjU2ZTY1YjRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm,” grumbled the grandmaster, not fazed by the implicit compliment.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTU3OTljMDhkZjQ4ZTBiMGNkMjk4NWQyNGM3NTAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We typically keep track and approach those we deem close to discovering its existence directly,” Chesterfield continued. “All Greatlords are informed of its existence and some of its threats so they can defend against them. Have you ever wondered why there’s so much emphasis on mages and warriors keeping their wards and aura up at all times? It’s not just for training. Imagine a Mistwalker assassin standing next to you in the Shimmer.” Chesterfield moved to stand by the grandmaster, brandishing a pen. “Now, force doesn’t transfer well across the boundary, so I can’t stab Grandmaster Shun so easily, but if I start my momentum within the Shimmer…” Chesterfield demonstrated, slowly pushing the pen towards the grandmaster. “Then exit it just as I’m about to make contact…”</span></p><span class="cmEyNDk2ZWMyMDdkMDQxZDdhODYyMjc0ZjMzMTY2ODdm"><br/>Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4NWQzYmM0Y2FiYzRjNTM5M2JhMDA3MzQzMDczMDRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An unblockable attack,” Serena finished.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmUzYzI3MTEyNjRlNTFhZGJlNDNmYzM5NGI0NWZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unless he has the habit of always running his aura,” Chesterfield nodded. “There are more concerns, but we’ll go over them later. Know this: we always planned to inform the pair of you about the Shimmer after you’ve finished recruitment.” His eyes narrowed, and his voice became cold. “The Enemy also has access to it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWE2ODY0YTEwNDRjNjViMmZkY2QxNjA4YzI5ZWJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Darkblades…” Serena murmured as the grandmaster growled. Another piece of the puzzle fell into place. She’d always wondered why the darkblades always seemed to pop up in a city, commit their act of terror, and vanish so quickly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDlmMDkxMWRkNTQ1ZTE4NDhkMWE3MTdkZjZkZTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Chesterfield said solemnly. “We’ll brief you both on the extent of which later. For now, read these over.” He picked up a small bundle of papers stapled together and handed them to Serena. “It’s what information we have on both of our thieves. While you do that, I’ve just been informed that Greatlord Oshiro is about to arrive. It would be polite for me to bring him here personally. Excuse me.” Chesterfield placed down his tea and exited the room, leaving Serena alone with the grandmaster and Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWRlZGQyNjU5ZDQ0ZjA4MTQzN2VkNmYzNGJjYzhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena didn’t question how Chesterfield came to be informed about Greatlord Oshiro’s arrival. She didn’t sense anything happening in the aetherfield. Whatever technique, spell or blessing the man used to hide his presence seemed to hide other things as well.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjVlNWY2YWE5MzRkMTU4MmIxYzMxNDhjMTU5YjY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her attention to the paper. The information was limited. These two lived in the slums where there wasn’t exactly rigorous record keeping. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Seonmi San</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> first appeared five years ago, involved in a case where she conned a wealthy merchant into thinking he was buying an island. Serena’s eyes widened as she saw the woman was potentially </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">highborn</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Then, as she flicked to the documents of the man known as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she also noticed he was suspected of being the remnants of a fallen house!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGFkM2RkZTVjODQwMjI4MTZiMDU1MWRjYjc5OWJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re highborn,” she echoed. “Fallen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGI3Yjg1ZjMwMTRlMzFiYTI3OWE4YjQ1M2ZjOWU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Highborn in blood, lowborn in actions,” grumbled the grandmaster. “Your situation in life is no excuse to act below your standing.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTUzODdhMDg2NDRjMzA4MGVhZDc0ZTdlMGIyMjg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest of the documents detailed the gangs that operated below the city. What were the guards doing to allow so many organised criminals to establish themselves? Were they being bribed? Serena narrowed her eyes. This was why the military didn’t care much for the Old Guard. Civilians were always more vulnerable to bribes and threats. They didn’t have the standard of discipline and training the military did.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTQ5YTU5NjQxNzQ1M2NiMWI1NGQzZDNhMDlkMWVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A long pause ensued as Serena silently read the papers, and Amelia hummed quietly while drinking her fragrant mint tea. Then, out of nowhere, the grandmaster spoke while facing away from them at the window.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzZmMTUxZjE4YzQyMWJhYTVlODg3MTVmZDc4NmVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rumours have been circulating about you two,” he grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOThiMzU5Y2Y0NTQ4Nzc4YTViOGI3MTZkMDEzNzU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena froze, and Amelia began choking on her tea.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjY1MzVhZjQ4NzQwMDBiZjY1NjI1ZTc2ZGI5N2E1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ack! Second! Ack!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Amelia continued coughing heavily until her body glowed gold and blue as she healed away her coughing fit. “Ahem!” she finished, patting her chest. “Sorry?” she asked with a forced smile towards the back of the grandmaster. “What was that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjA4Y2UzNzdmOTRjYmE4MTk4ODY4NjZjYzFjNTZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some staff members have concerns about the nature of your… relationship.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGVhZGQ3YWJiMDQ1YzBiMTBjYzM3MTU4MjM3MGY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t ask what concerns,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena thought, with a quick mental prayer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDM5OWNhOTQ0ZTRiYTU4OTkzZTE4MWQzMDhlODE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What concerns!?” Amelia piped up, her eyes wide with innocence.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTk1ODI5YTFiNDQwMzY4NTVjMzMzZGM1NjMyNTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before Serena could speak, the grandmaster said, “I’ve received concerns regarding the, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ahem</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">-” the grandmaster coughed into his hand. “The possibility of illicit, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ahem-</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” He coughed again. “Nighttime activities that may or may not have occurred…” the grandmaster coughed again, his back still towards them. “Nevertheless, I’m sure you understand how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">damaging</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> such rumours might be to the academy's reputation, should outside forces ever discover they have merit. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahem!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” He coughed several more times.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTZjMzdhOTVkYzQ1MDViMGVlMWJhYWM4N2I4MTc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s giving us a way out</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">He knows it’s likely true but doesn’t want to risk the academy’s reputation.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMxMDJkMzg0NzRkNzRkYzY4Njg1YWNkNzIwZmE2NWEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Would you like some honey tea to help with that cough?” Amelia asked cheerfully.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDBkNWQxNjBmODRjODdiYjcxMWY5YzhiY2QwODQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Idiot!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena mentally clutched her horns and then mentally ruffled Amelia’s hair. No. Wait. Amelia had a mischievous look in her eye. She knew what she was doing! The grandmaster was a monster in the world of martial arts! His backing or criticism could make and break careers! What madwoman would tease that man like this!? </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGU1YjFlZGJjMTQ4NDJhNTZhNzc5ZWM2ZjkxN2Ji" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, Amelia would, of course.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWZiZWE0ZTgyZTQxZTc4OTU2MWEwZjZmNmNmOGUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“During our time at the academy, I don’t believe those rumours will find merit,” Serena tentatively began, forcing her voice to be even. “I would respectfully suggest that you indicate to those staff members who have brought their concern that they would better spend their time focusing on their </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">own </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">duties.” She injected a slight annoyance into her voice. “After all, it’s the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ninth</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> century. It is not abnormal for a demon and a human to have a close relationship, especially in the case of two warriors </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">training</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> with each other.” Feeling confident, she clicked her tongue and tapped the floor with her foot. “I’d rather not be forced to entertain the gossiping of academy staff who </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">should know better</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I think we can put this matter to bed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWY4YTMyNDhhYzRlOWFhNGNmMTNjOWRmZTEyMzEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps not the best phrase to end on</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODNlZmEwMjM3NzRhZmE5NjM3ZmM0MTc4NDY3M2Mx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...And what are your thoughts, Assistant Instructor Thornheart?” the grandmaster intoned, his voice low.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzE4ODY5NmUzZTQ3ZDU5YTY5YjA4M2Y2NDA5NmE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No comment!” Amelia shook her head. “I won’t be forced to answer details about my private life, no matter who asks! It’s my life, and I’ll share information about it as I wish! I don’t care if Greatlord Oshiro enquires himself!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2NlMmI3ODE3NjQ1YTdhNWM3NTcyOTU3YjU0OGVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What am I enquiring about?” Greatlord Oshiro asked as he opened the door and stepped through, followed closely by Chesterfield.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDIzYzQ3OWQ4ZjRhZTk5YTExOTllMTE5NGRkMDA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord Oshiro,” Serena immediately spoke respectfully, bowing deeply at his entrance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzJiOTgwMGJkNjRkNjU4YWM4NjVjNzBkMzU1NWEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord,” grumbled the grandmaster, bowing halfway. Despite the situation's awkwardness, the grandmaster appeared to still feel frustrated regarding the Old Guard’s competence during the ochimusha incident. His half-bow would be a sign of protest.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjU0ZDEyMWE0YTQ4MTliNTg1YjAwNDlmZmFkZGJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia also performed a decent bow, although she forgot to speak his title. Still, Greatlord Oshiro didn’t seem to mind. “An interesting gathering of people,” he mused. “Now, Lord-Prospect Thornheart, may you share why you’ve invoked my name with such passion? What secret are you so determined to keep from me, your Lord Superior?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmZkYWM1ZWIxNDRiNjI4NGRhODk0YWE3ZDc3Y2Zk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, uh…” Amelia fidgeted. “Nothing important, I wouldn’t worry about it… really…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDY5YjA4ZWQxYjRmZmQ5NjI5MmYwNDVkNjQzZTBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?” Greatlord Oshiro’s mouth curled, and behind him, Chesterfield’s face also formed an expression of amusement as Amelia squirmed under pressure. “How about you, Grandmaster Shun? By my ears, it was you who the Lord-Prospect was talking to.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmU1NzUxMmY0MTQwYzA4YjQ2OGQ4YmNmYjNlNTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...An academy matter, Greatlord,” the grandmaster coolly intoned. “Nothing to concern yourself over.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWM2Y2E2ZjZmZjRlMmJiMTc2MzRhNmZkZDM3MDU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well.” The greatlord’s eyes twinkled as they passed over Serena. “I’m sure if it’s important, it’ll worm its way into the cold moonlight, won’t it?” Greatlord Oshiro stepped further into the room, pouring himself some tea. His natural gravitas and presence seemed to fill the space, making it his own. “Although I must confess myself, Lord-Prospect Thornheart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjA5MmY4NDJjYTQ3MjVhOWNjZDNkOTQ5ZGI4MGIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what about?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGE4NDhjYmI1YTQyYjQ5ODA4ZmNiNDk3NmExZDYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have been a hypocrite just now, for I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">myself </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">have been invoking your name numerous times over the last week. In fact, I think you may have been the subject of almost every conversation I’ve had recently. Can you imagine that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGFjM2EzOTFlMzQzZDA5N2JjYTA0ZTI3ZWRiOWQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, thank you, Greatlord,” Amelia said after some hesitation. “It’s an… honour?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTIwODZjZGY0YTRmZDU4OGE1MjhkZTI0NzM3ODIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, of course,” the greatlord replied with a smile, taking a sip of his mint tea. “It’s truly a wonder. No matter who I’m talking to, whether a fellow Greatlord, a representative from the Centralis Parliament, or a trade delegation from the Sabanis Dominance…” He took another long sip of tea. Serena sensed he was building up to something. “...They all seem equally entertained by how the local deer suffered so terribly by your hands, even in death.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDc5NTM3MzRiMTQ4NTJiMjk4ZjcwNTFhZjFkZWMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia whimpered. Ha! She actually </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">whimpered</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was a noise somewhere between the sound of a deflating balloon and the depressed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">mewing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of a peeka. Serena didn’t know whether to laugh or feel sorry for her. The grandmaster’s face was confused; he evidently wasn’t aware of how Amelia had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">butchered</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the venison at the family meal when she’d been asked to carve.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTY4OGNlYTVjNjQxMzJhMGJlZTkyNjA1Y2JjNmU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">carve</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she did. Serena couldn’t help but chuckle at the memory.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTA1ZjM0NzMxYTRmZjliMzJmNWM5YTI0MWY2NWM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please… have mercy…” Amelia mumbled, bowing again. Serena wasn’t sure whether she was bowing to apologise or just to hide her flushed face.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGY2YTNlMjQxYTQ0MGY5YTE4MmRkMjE4MjQ4NmE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course,” Greatlord Oshiro replied cheerfully. “See it only as pre-emptive satisfaction for the series of future headaches I am confident you’ll be causing me and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">my</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Lord Superior.” He turned towards Serena, a sympathetic smile on his face. “I recommend mint tea during stressful moments, Lord Halen. It helps.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Yjc1YWY2OGU0ZjRjNmRiYjJhZjU5M2I4NjE1YjBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Thank you, Greatlord.” Serena bowed again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTBlYzNjNDJmODQ5MjQ4ZDQ2YTZlMWYxODQxN2U0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now then,” he continued, striding up to the window, looking down into the room where the man named Noburu lay sleeping. “This is our man?” he asked, looking at Chesterfield, who nodded. “To think a lowborn thief would be given the blessing of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mistwalking</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Do we know what god blessed him?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjQ5NzJmZTQ4ZTQzZWRiMDcyMjdhYTE1ZjdiZmE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Chesterfield answered. “I have an Imperial Investigator arriving shortly with someone who will be able to tell us for sure. Historically, something like this would be the work of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaxai</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDk3Y2ZlNzE4OTQzZmZhZDBiZWE2MmNhOGE3NDE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fitting…” Greatlord Oshiro murmured. He paced to the other window, looking down at the woman named Seonmi. “I’ve seen this one before, during the Blue Dinner three years ago, where I made a short appearance. Even so, beyond my memory, this woman is oddly familiar to me. Why is that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTdiNmZlOWUwMTQ1NTJiOWI5YTBkN2JhYzMxZGQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Her full name is Seonmi San,” Chesterfield explained. “She didn’t change it, perhaps not wanting to abandon her past and believing no one would make the connection with such a common surname. She’s familiar because she’s the long presumed-dead heir apparent of House San.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWZhMmQ3ZWI1MTQyZGY4YjQ3ODRiMWQyYjU5MTk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Highlord San’s daughter!?” Greatlord Oshiro’s eyes widened. “This thief? The very same?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2EzZjI1NjM4MjQwMmZiNGJlYTBlMzlhMGFkZjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Highborn in blood. Lowborn in action,” the grandmaster grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjRjMzcxZTEyZjQzYzY5MjA0ZjNmZDljOGYyMzAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seems so,” Chesterfield continued. “We’re going to interrogate her and find out for sure, but the best guess is that she fled Fengra due to the succession crisis a few years ago. She probably had a target on her back. Maybe she planned to return eventually.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2FmY2Q2MDM2NjQ2OWE5MDQyNjg3OTM2ZjE1ODY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” Greatlord Oshiro rubbed his stubble. “Now I remember. The eldest sister, Haneul San, was declared the successor. Then I remember House San announcing a period of grieving for the death of one of their daughters - presumably this Seonmi. It wouldn’t be the first time something like this was covered up. Didn’t Haneul die somewhat recently?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzIwMGM0ZmYxZTRkYmNhZTg2ZWYzMWIwOGE5OGIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Haneul San. Where had Serena heard that name before? Someone had mentioned it to her, and not too long ago. Where was it? When?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDM0NzE1MWRiMjRiMjY5MWY3ZDVmN2MyNDA0M2M4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Given the… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">attitude</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of House San towards the reigning Overlord, you can understand that not only does this case need to be handled delicately, but it also presents a powerful opportunity for our influence over the Far East.” Chesterfield placed his cup down. “If we bring her out now, they’ll refuse to recognise her. We need to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">elevate</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her standing with the East before we move.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTE0OWViYmI1OTRkNDg4NDIyYmMxNDAxODEyNTUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And how…?” Greatlord Oshiro suddenly turned his head, glancing at Serena. “Ah, I see.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTYzOGJiYzdiZTQ4ZjFiOGVmM2Y3MzIzOGNjMDZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">You see? What do you see!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena hurriedly thought. Her mind was still reeling from the conversation with the grandmaster. What dots had Greatlord Oshiro connected that she missed? Who had spoken the name </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Haneul San</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to her recently?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGQ2MzRiOWE5ZjQyZGFiZTI5ODI2ZDJjYjkwYmE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about this one?” Greatlord Oshiro asked, pacing back down the room to look down upon Noburu. “You mentioned he was also highborn.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmQ5OGU2ZjQwNzQyOTliNGM4NDQ5YzVjMTA0ODNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He goes by Noburu in the slums, but we believe he’s the last surviving male member of House Yun. If our documents are correct, his real name might be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Minho Yun</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTI1Mjc2NjRiNDQzOGNhZWQ0NzI2NmQ0MzA4YWI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord Oshiro raised an eyebrow at Chesterfield. “How sure are you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTJlYzdjMzQwYjQ1MThiYzkxYTRlMzkxN2U2NDk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re investigating the orphanage he grew up in. We don’t have any photographs or descriptions of his birth, but we do for his younger sister, who was born shortly before the House collapsed. There’s a hornmark consistent between our records and the orphanages. Given their similar appearance, we’re pretty confident. And, like with the woman, there’s an opportunity here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTY2OTc3YTBlNzRlNTRhZTQwMzQyMGY2ZmYyNjk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, what an interesting pair of horns to interrupt my schedule,” Greatlord Oshiro said. “Shall we get started with the interrogations, then?” He cracked a knuckle.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmN2QwYTVkYWExYTQ0N2JhZTc5ZTI5ODZkNmYyNWNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Given the delicate nature of his blessing and possible position, I have an Imperial Investigator due to arrive, along with a capable individual who would be able to prevent any escape attempts should he try and mistwalk. Ah, Grandmaster…” Chesterfield bowed towards the towering martial artist. “My apologies, but I have to inform you that what will follow from this interrogation is likely a classified matter. Would you-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTUzODE1YjcyNTRiMDJiYTQyMWZjMjM1NmFkZjU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say no more,” the grandmaster growled. “Send for me if I’m needed. I’ll keep my horns straight. You keep yours.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzNmNDg0NDlmMjRjYjA5MmUwNGFkMTM2OTJlZjdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, he strode to the door, turned, gave a firm half-bow, and left the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjU5MzI5YzNkMTQyMGQ4YTM3MjQwNTFmNmZlMDUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s annoyed,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> thought Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjM0NmFhNDdkMzQ3NjZhNzU4YmE5NGMzOTI1YzI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesterfield and Greatlord Oshiro continued to discuss matters. Considering neither she nor Amelia were asked to leave, it would seem they were included in whatever </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">classified</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> conclusion they would be arriving at. Chesterfield had mentioned Noburu might be some kind of aid for Amelia’s training regarding the Shimmer. What would they do, have him teach her how to travel through this other reality? How dangerous would that be?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmEzN2JlZjllOTQwNDM5OTQxMWIyNmQxNzU0MmM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And more importantly, the academy staff <em>knew</em>, or at the very least, suspected!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzQ0YWE3MDk1MzQ3YTRiOTNjZDJiODNiYmNmYjU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She needed to talk with Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmU5MTlmNTJmZjRhZWNiMjA3Y2Y3NzhmZTcyYzIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena looked at Amelia until she noticed, then tilted her head towards the door. She repeated this twice and then said to the room, “Excuse me. I’ll return shortly.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2U1MjBiYTExYTQ2YzJhZDczOTYxNzhlYzBmOTBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-me too!” Amelia chirped. “Nature calls!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzczMzI4MzQ2NzRmZjI5NjNiYWMwODMxMzY4OGEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena rolled her eyes as the corners of the men’s mouths curled. Hadn’t she taught Amelia that a lady should never reference using the toilet when in the company of men!? </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGYwMmEzNmFjZjRhOWE4MDQ1YzI2ZjRhZmU2NDE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, they didn’t seem offended. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTNmYTJkZTExODRlNWRhYjI1NjEyYTE3MjFmYzc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They both deeply bowed toward the room before exiting. Following the directions the detective had given her, Serena found the shared toilets, which consisted of a brightly lit room with a row of sinks and cubicles. It was uncomfortably </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">modern</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Although judging by the clean tiles and mirrored surfaces, this room was far more pleasant than the shared latrine her crew used onboard the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmZjYzg4NTJmZjRjYWI4YTY3YTg0NGEwMGUxYjM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoa,” Amelia murmured as they entered, her aether twisting. Serena sensed the privacy wards Amelia surrounded the room in. “If you added a bit of plastic, this could be a bathroom from- mmph!” Amelia’s words were cut short as Serena, after verifying they were alone in the room, began pulling Amelia’s cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDE4MjA1Y2Q4YzQxNDFiNzM1ZTM1OWI2Mzc0MWYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You idiot,” Serena intoned as she massaged her girlfriend’s face. “Some of the academy staff are onto us! They’re probably gossiping after discovering you’ve been spending the night with me!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDNhM2ZmNWRiNTQxYTY5ZDA5Y2FhZTM1Y2Q1ZWI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So?” Amelia replied, reaching up and locking their hands together. “We just need to be careful. It’s not such a big deal anyway, we- mmpth!” This time, Amelia was cut short as Serena stole a kiss.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTQzZmZmN2Q3ODQ2ZjFiYWFhMzFlMTIzNjk4MWY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hells, when had she become so impulsive?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjY1Zjc2MWNjYTQzNDQ4OGUyMTU5YjZkNDY4NmVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s your punishment for being… you,” Serena said, licking her lips.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjM5OTk4MmNiYzQ3MDY5YTIyZGMzZDNhOTZmOTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have to admit,” Amelia said, her face flushing as her mouth moved into a smug smile. “I’m starting to enjoy what you consider a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">punishment</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTFiMGZmMmY3YjRmYzhiMTA2MWFjZjIxZDk1ZGRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up,” Serena said. “This is serious. Some of the staff at the academy are well-known and well-respected. Their words carry </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">weight</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. We do need to be careful!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGJjYzY3MjAwNzRhM2ViYTE4M2Y0M2E2NDhkM2Q1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine,” Amelia pouted. “But even so, if the Grandmaster is on our side, then he can override anyone trying to make a problem, can’t he? They’ll go through him first, wouldn’t they?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTJlNTA0OTcwODRiYWM4ZTM0YjU2NGViYjdmZGUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What makes you think he’s on our side?” Serena asked with a tilt of her head. “That man is extremely traditional. He values the reputation of the academy </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">highly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Didn’t you understand the message behind his words? He’s not happy about it. He wants us to knock it off!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGI2ODdhODMzNTRlNmZiOTRiZDk3N2I1M2NkYTE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe, but you also didn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">see</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Amelia said with a grin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWFmM2VlNDVjNDQzYjVhMGI1ZDJlODYyMzIzYWNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“See what?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTBkMjM2YmZhODRlZmZhMmVhMjc0N2Y1YWRlYTU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When he raised the subject with us earlier. You know, when he was coughing? You didn’t see because he was facing directly away from you, but I was slightly to the side. I could see the side of his face. That’s how I know he’ll protect us!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTdlM2U4ZDM0YTRkNTdhMTA2NDUxNDQzYjEzZWUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Why?” Serena frowned. “What did you see?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDBhZmJmNjI3YTRlMGI5OGNjNDZhMzViODk4MTc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When he was talking…” Amelia’s grin grew even wider.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjFhM2QxMjAxMzQ3ZjE5ZDU1OWZlZDQ2YTFmODZj" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...He was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">blushing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMxNDFmMjQ1OTQ2MTQxZjNhYTE5YTM0ZjhiMzhlOTBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDg2M2EzZTI5MDQ2Y2VhY2VlZmU4NjY1ODE3Mjg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a moment to ensure neither of them had any noticeable flush on their faces, Serena and Amelia returned to the observation deck, where they found Greatlord Oshiro alone.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2UwYjMwMmUzNDQxNDU5YjZmN2QyOGUyNDY4YWEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord,” Serena intoned, bowing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2Q1ZTBiMTFjZTRjZmM4ZThiZjc1MDE3OThlYTU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia followed suit, this time remembering his title.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWUzZDMzMGEyODQ2YjhhN2FkYjgzZWM2Y2YyNDA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in the dimly lit room, the Greatlord’s presence shone. He stood with perfect posture at the window, his hands clasped behind his back. What would it be like to wear his horns? To be responsible for Asamaywa’s security and the million demons residing in the city? Today’s events felt significant to Serena, but they were probably a small blip in the Greatlord’s diary.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGFiNzM1ZTA2OTRjNWVhNTg2NGQ2Yzg1M2IzZjFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s Chesterfield?” Amelia piped up, her voice a little quieter than usual. Even she wasn’t entirely immune to the Greatlord’s aura.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTk2YjM4MWFiMDQ5ZGE5NjllZTkyNGJlMGZmYzA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He stepped out to meet the Imperial Investigator and someone… important.” The demon sniffed. “I suggest you get ready to bow when they arrive.” Before Serena could enquire as to whom the important figure was, the greatlord continued, “Seems interesting things keep happening around you two.” He turned to face Serena. “Even before Lord-Prospect Thornheart’s appearance, your name was constantly on my desk, Lord Halen. I knew I wouldn’t regret recommending the daughter of Highlord Halen.” He raised his eyebrow, his expression warming. “You’ve had an interesting career, Captain. I still don’t believe your victory at the battle of Port Highwind was adequately commemorated. A Cascadian Lordship and a Bronze Eagle isn’t enough for the results of your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">duty</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzA0MWYxYzAyOTQ0Mjg5ODcxYmNiYzk3Y2RjMmIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena swallowed. What prompted this sudden outburst of compliments? Even as she questioned it, she could feel her pride swelling. To cover her reaction up, she bowed deeply once more. “Thank you, Greatlord,” she said, trying to keep her voice even. “I merely followed your orders and-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTQ3ZDhjZmRiZDQ5MWI4YzhhMjhmOTFkMGEwZjRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No need for modesty,” Greatlord Oshiro interrupted. “Stand up, Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGRlNDg1ZjBlNjQyMDI4M2FkNWM1NWZkNjZlOGM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena straightened.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTBkZDBhNGEyYzQ4MmY4MDgzNWE2M2UyMWNhZTk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“While the international situation is growing more perilous by the month, your actions have reaped more than we could have hoped along the Republican lines,” he continued. “Their situation was much more dire than we previously estimated. Meppen’s defences collapsed yesterday. We’ll liberate the city within a week.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTFmZWNmNWYwNjQ2NTdiNTcxMzMyZjcwM2I1MTRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s eyes widened, her mouth briefly opening in shock. Could it be? The Republican capital! “T-that means-” Serena paused, forcing herself to stop stuttering. “Then the Republic’s about to be cut in half. That means we’ve…” Serena trailed off, her mind imagining the map. With the capital, Meppen, taken, the Republican wartime industry in the east would come under siege. With Cascadia occupying the railways, the munitions and weapons produced in the industrious Ironburg wouldn’t be able to get to the west, meaning that the front would completely collapse!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGI3ZjliOWUwMTQ4OTdiNWVlYTUxYzhkNWQxYmY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only a matter of time.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjE2MDEzN2ZmMjQ3MzY4ODNlODVmNDdjMTNhNjA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s only a matter of time,” Greatlord Oshiro said. “Two or three months to crush what remains. If you allow me to finish your sentence… you are correct.” His eyes flashed menacingly. “We’ve won.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjJiMmRmMmQ4NzRmNjVhMmI4MWYxMzhjY2ViMmYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t believe it…” Serena muttered. Eight years of war. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Eight</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Sure, not all of it was the brutal attrition war it had become - still… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">eight years</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Serena had given so much. She’d lost a brother to the conflict! Her father had become a Highlord! She’d given her youth for it!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTgyMjNhZDYwNjRhZGU5NmU5NTY2ZGEyY2FkNGU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, the last one seemed to be reversing, thanks to Amelia’s morning healing. Serena was pretty sure she would pass for around twenty-five now, more than half a decade younger than her actual age of-</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTZlYzgxMTcyMDQ5NzE5ZDA2M2JhZWVlMWNlMGJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, never mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjlkYTVjMzM4MDQ1ZWVhZWY0MzI2NjM1NjRiOGNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Neither do I,” the greatlord said solemnly. “Not yet. They’ve run out of experienced men, and the mercenaries from Christdom and the Federation cannot plug the gaps. They cannot raise more conscripts, not without starving their population. They’ve lost too many warriors and mages. The few powerful Speakers they have left won’t throw away their lives in a lost war. Even so…” the greatlord sighed. “We still don’t know what the other nations will do, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">especially </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Christdom. You’ve seen them talking about a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">coalition of the willing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” His mouth curled into a sneer as he sarcastically mimicked human nations' phrasing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWQ4MTk2OTljNTQ3MjNhMmJjY2Y1MzUyNjg0ZWUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It would be madness for them to get involved now,” Serena pointed out. “They wouldn’t commit their national armies and navies to fight in an unfamiliar land and sky.” Cascadia had ruled the Republic for more than a century before their rebellion. No one knew that sky better than they did. The Empire knew the location, direction and power of every anabatic or katabatic wind. They knew the jet streams, trade winds, the extent of the easterlies, and how the mistral winds broke upon the territory from the Sabanis Channel.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWIyMTkwNzk2ODQxYjk5YjFhZjMwNzU1NDVkZmEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Madness</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is the key word here, Captain Halen. Some of my peers have already begun celebrating, but I fear we may become mad ourselves just as we enter a more perilous time. Never before has Cascadia shown such </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">unity </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">against a foreign threat.” The greatlord raised a fist, clenching it until his knuckles whitened. “Never before have we built so many warships, raised so many battalions, nor bled so much </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">blood</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The human nations put their weight behind the Republic because they feared Cascadia becoming a major power on their continent. Now, that reality is about to come true, and our military might has </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">never </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">been greater. Even the Sabanis Dominance is becoming wary of the East’s strength.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjAyYzIzM2VhYzRlNGQ5OGMxODI1NWJhNWFmYjM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...You fear a larger war is coming?” Serena questioned. After she received a slow nod in response, she continued, “I’ve had similar concerns. So has Father.” She didn’t mention the information Aiden had leaked the other day regarding further expansion of Cascadian wartime industry beyond what the Republican war would require. It was probably information she wasn’t supposed to have.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTAwMDRkZTg4NTQ1YzFhYzMwNTk1Yzc4NWRjY2Mz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Highlord Halen is wise, and I see you’ve inherited that wisdom.” He clicked his tongue. “We must not become drunk on this victory, but focus on firmly grasping the next one before it slips away. I’m confident that you will be of great value to the future of this Empire, Captain Halen. Whether you work under me or that bighorn from Intelligence. I was not merely passing polite words earlier regarding your achievements. To that end…” Serena’s Lord Superior took a breath.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2ZjODIyYjk4ZjRhYTc5NThlNDYxOTc5ZTUwNTlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...I’m recommending your advancement to Commodore, Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWY0MGY0N2ViYTRmM2FhMDA4YzlmM2JlMjAxYTRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“C-commodore!” Amelia squeaked, her teacup frozen on her lips.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzE2NjRlYzk0YzQyYTFiZGY5ZjBiNjhlNjgzNTdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord!” Serena threw herself into her deepest bow yet. Commodore! She was going to be promoted! Had she truly earned this!? No, she had, hadn’t she? She’d dedicated so much… But… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Commodore</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! To reach this rank so quickly! She was so young! She was only-</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTlmNmRhZGUyYTQ0ZjY4OTNiZDQ4NDVhMDlkMjMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, never mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGEzYjg4ODJkZDRmNWE4NDAzZDU1MjA5YzI2MGQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ll still need to pass the exam, Captain,” came Greatlord Oshiro’s amused voice. “You might be working for Intelligence now, but they can’t stop me from doing this. It’ll be a difficult exam, so make sure you study. I won’t be the only Greatlord on the panel.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGM5YjE0NDcwMDQ5NjFiZjMzZWEwODEzMzk0MTJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-” Serena cleared her throat. The adrenaline was making her stutter. “Yes, Greatlord! It’s an honour!” Serena rose from her bow to see her Lord Superior looking at her with an appreciative smile. Turning her head, Serena saw Amelia had put down her cup and was silently clapping with small, eager motions.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTBmODRhOTc1YTRiODBiYTlmZjU0YjYwYjY1YjM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Well done,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her girlfriend mouthed.</span></p>

It’s an honour!” Ah, she’d started to ramble. “I only wish I could show my appreciation!” She couldn’t stop herself from bowing again. This wasn’t embarrassing, was it?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODY5MjAyZjAxMDRjYjBhNmUzNWM5ZmZlZWMxYWU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You only need to keep doing what you’re doing, Captain,” Greatlord Oshiro mused. “Although you might start by preparing some more mint tea. I seemed to have run out.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDVmNjUwOWY0MjRhMmY4NjA5NTE0M2I2ODA4YzI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, of course,” Serena turned and busied herself preparing the tea. She boiled the water and began steeping the tea leaves, trying to hide the smile that kept breaking out on her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzVjMGY2ZGJlNTRlZDliMGYzYjU1YzBjYTQ4M2I2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When the door opened again, she barely registered it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTkyNzhhMTI5ZDQwOGI4YzJhMmQwYzBhOTE5ZmQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When she did turn, her eyes widened at the sight. She saw Greatlord Oshiro </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bowing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as profoundly as Serena had just been toward him in the direction of the door. It wasn’t just a bow of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">respect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, but one of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">submission </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">as well.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2RiNmYzMjM2MzRiYWNhMmZhZmViOGM5ZjI2Zjg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena quickly faced the door and looked at the newcomers. Who in the seven hells could have turned up for a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">greatlord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to behave like that? She couldn’t sense anything in the aetherfield, so it couldn’t have been the monstrous overlord that had demonstrated confidence in dressing down Amelia when she was under the influence of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzNmZGNlZTU4ZTRkYTQ5MWY0ZjRmNDA0YzgyODg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was Chesterfield, strolling in like he owned the place. Not him. Next to him was a neatly dressed, spectacled demon with tidy hair. - the Imperial Investigator. Serena recognised the uniform. Not him. No, it was the hulking figure behind them. Serena’s blood turned cold. Her earlier adrenaline from Greatlord Oshiro’s recommendation now told her to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">run</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Her instincts screamed at her one terrible, irrefutable fact.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDY4ZDE1NTAzMDQwMDk4ZTRjZmY3NmZjMzZhNzU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If she fought with this man, she would die.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmI4NGRlZGU3YjRkNWViOWFlNWEwNWE3MzUxMGRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not even Katalin imposed such dread upon her!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjFhMzg3ZTI4ZDRjZDViNjlhYjM1YTY3OTdkNDM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">His massive body blocked the door, and he had to bend down to make it through. His thick horns barely missed the ceiling. He was the tallest demon Serena had ever seen up close. The man must be at least eight feet tall! Alongside his horns, short brown hair that was greying crowned a heavily scarred face. One of his eyes was milky white, the cause of which was highlighted by a great scar starting from the top left of his forehead and ending at his mouth. His other eye, set under a heavy brow, was brownish-orange, a sign of possible lowborn origins. Not that a single person in ten thousand klicks, whether demon or human, noble or commoner, would </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">dare</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> speak the word </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lowborn</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in reference to this man's presence.</span></p><span class="cjFiYzMyZGZjMmRkZDRjODM4M2U5MzE5MDdiODliNDNi"><br/>This novel is published on a different platform.

<p class="cnNmZjFkNzFhNjczYjRmNmRiZmY3N2YyZmRmNzMwYjJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">His head sat upon a thick, muscular neck. He wore a weighty gold-trimmed white cloak - big enough that two people could use it as a sleeping bag. His torso was adorned with a thick chestplate inlaid with gold and silver, forming the Imperial sigil - a crown wreathed by a pair of horns. His armour was metallic with the same base white and gold trim as the cloak. He wore similar pauldons, vambraces and gauntlets across his shoulders and arms. The cloak partially covered his shoulders, but she caught a glimpse of a wolfhound’s face inlaid upon them. His armour didn’t end there; his legs were fully protected by cuirasses, poleyns, greaves and, for his feet, a pair of sabatons that narrowed into a deadly point. The remaining areas were covered with a coarse-looking leather that looked like it could resist even an aura-enhanced sword.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmI2ZTYzYTI4OTRmNGNiMTQ2YjllMjgwZGMxYjJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of weapons, he carried a pistol holstered on his right hip that looked too heavy for a normal person to try and use one-handed. He also possessed a longsword on his left hip, its hilt decorated with the same Imperial sigil. A belt was fitted around his lower chest, where no less than a dozen daggers sat ready. As a Cascadian Lord, Serena was entitled to carry her sword in most places, but </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">this man</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was one of a select few who could carry weapons in a location where not even Greatlord Oshiro could.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWVkMTZiN2M3ODRhNjc4NjUyOTE5MDYxYmRiNzUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Cathedral of Bone, in the presence of the Empress herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzkyOTRlZGVlNzRlNzZhY2NkMzk3ZmRiMmEwMzZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven hells. What in the Blue Moon was a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Guardian</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> doing here!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTQwMmU3MDY4MzRlNzQ5ZWUwNmU2YzU4NTBhZjNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was… was the Empress nearby!? They were her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">personal </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">guards, after all! By Imperial decree, other than the Empress, only their captain and the four overlords had authority over them! Not even Greatlord Oshiro could refuse them! They were the elite of the elite! The pinnacle of warriors!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmRhODEyOTFhZDQ3OTk5ZGQzNzM1NzQxYWIyZmRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And now he was looking at her! Damn it! Her mind and eyes had been wandering!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmVjNzhmODZkNzQ4MGJhMjczZTc3ZDJkODU0ODQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena threw herself into a bow and then, realising she should do more, hurriedly got on one knee and bent her head, trying to fight against her body that wanted her to run.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWZmZjY4ZTYzMzRlZDRhNjRjMzNlYmIyMzU5NmNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank the hells, Amelia was following suit.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODA2Nzg0ODg2YjRmZDBhMzJlNWZlYjYwOWVkMjk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome, Lord Guardian, protector of the Shard of Infinity, shield of the Overlord of Overlords, blade of her Divine Will.” Greatlord Oshiro spoke, his voice low. “Your will is my will. My sword is your sword.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGFiNGZjNjZhMTQzYjhiZjc1MmUyODkyMjUxZjI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your will is my will,” Serena echoing the line from her ascension vows. “My sword is your sword.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Zjk0MzViNDUwODQxOGQ4MzEyYzc0NDc5MGM4NWNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-me to!” Amelia blurted out. “Your will is my will…” There was an awkward pause. “My sword is your sword.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGJhY2I4NmM5MTQ1YjliNDQyZTM0M2QxNTNhM2Zk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A long silence ensued, and then a low voice growled, “Lords of the East. Your consideration is noted. You may stand.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjJhMjU1NzUxNDQyYzU4OTQ2N2M0Y2ZlZWMzMmEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena hesitantly stood, only to see the Lord Guardian’s eyes boring into her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGQxOGFiMzdkMjQ0N2M4ZmNkNWY0NmVlNTQwMjY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Halen,” he spoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2YxMjc2NmNiZDQ4NTliMjY1YTM4MTJjMjUxMTdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Lord Guardian?” Somehow, Serena kept her voice from shaking.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDM3YWZhMzk5YTQwNzU4YTQ4Mjk4YTM0ZDQyNzA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that-” The man sniffed heavily. “-Mint tea you’re brewing?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2JkNTIxM2QxMTRmMGQ5NWYwYTVkMDA4NTE0Yzlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? I mean, Yes! Yes, Lord Guardian!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmQyMjBkNzZkYzRmNGRhNjVkZjE2ZGFiZmYzMmFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzMxYTJlNGZiNjQ3OGNhNjg0MDQ1YjQ5MGJkY2Jk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The enormous demon slowly crossed his arms, his forehead furrowing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDQ3MmVhZWM3ZjQzYzA5ZTE2NGUzMDQ3YjJmMWY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“May I have some?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjE5MzZiZDA2YzQ1NTdhODY0MjdkNGU5ODllYzE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena blinked three times before her mind steamed back into gear.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDBmMjU5NDY4NzQyMmViYmQzYjI4OGMzZWFjODRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, Lord Guardian!” She gestured to the kettle. “Help yourself! I mean,” she hastily corrected herself. “I’ll pour you some now!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Yzk2ZmNmMzk0MjQzN2JiMDQzZmZiN2I3ZTYyNmM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No need.” The Lord Guardian strode across the room. No, he didn’t stride. He </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">glided</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Somehow, he made no discernable sound with all his mass and all that metal armour. “I’m particular in how my tea is prepared.” He declared, coming to stand next to Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGZhMzE4MmEzZDRhMzg5MjlhMjk3OTRmNWIyMzFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She involuntarily took a step back. How could she not? That man was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">massive</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She would tweak her neck looking up to talk to him!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzQ4MGQ3N2QxZDRiYzNhZjkxYjkyODhlMjA0Mjkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Would anyone else like some?” The Lord Guardian asked the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzU3ZmIxZjExMDRlMjY5YWQ4ZWY4ZDk1ZTkxZjBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do not trouble yourself, Lord Guardian,” Greatlord Oshiro intoned with a bow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjU5ZGUzN2E4NDQyZmE4ZTZmMTQwNzYxNTRjNWFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thank you, Lord Guardian,” the spectacled Imperial Investigator said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmVhOGU1ZTZjMTRiZDg5OWM3ZmFhMDAwN2E3ZTgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is no need, Lord Guardian,” Chesterfield said. “I still have a warm cup left over here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODExZWE4ZTA5YjRkYTNiMjM3OGM0NTUxNjVhODM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thank you, Lord Guardian!” Serena managed to blurt out, reading the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzhlOWI3M2UwNzQ0YjliOTNjNjQwMDEwNWZmMTc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, please!” Amelia chirped, bouncing up to the side of the Lord Guardian, who was picking up the kettle. “I need a refill! Oh… why are you pouring it away?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGIzZDQ3ZTdiYjQxNzlhNjYxZWFhZWFlZWVlNzAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia! What are you doing!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena desperately prayed her attempt at telepathic communication would work. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Stop! Stop talking! Or I’m going to pull your cheeks so far apart you’ll… you’ll…</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyMjYzOTVlZDNmMzQ3NWJhNjQyMmVhNmNhNWU5Nzcw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“These leaves are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasimanda </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">mint,” the Lord Guardian explained, his voice suddenly quiet and soft yet still carrying throughout the room. “They should not be brewed with boiling water otherwise the tea will become bitter. Eighty-two thols for one hundred and fifty seconds is the preferred approach for the cleanest flavour.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzYwNGQ0OTRiMzRlZjE5NjhiNTY4MDA1OGI1ODIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, mmm!” Amelia hummed. “I see! I recently tried firemint tea myself!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGE3NTM2ZDE4NjRjNmI4NWMwYzM5ZmVlZjAxNDNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, a rare treat in the East, Lord-Prospect Thornheart!” The Lord Guardian's voice sounded… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">impressed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The massive demon set about refilling the kettle and heating it, the tools looking comically small in his huge hands. “Firemint is tricky. If you want to maximise its characteristic popping effect, then it should be brewed at eighty-eight thols. To maximise the flavour, ninety-six thols. Both for three minutes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjdhYTFlNDFmOTQyMjFhMDJlMjU2Yjg3ZjMxNWUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll remember that, thank you!” Amelia earnestly replied. “What other type of mint leaves are there?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzQwYWQ4ZGM5YTQwYmJhMDQ2MWZmMzg0OGZjNTBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An excellent question, Lord-Prospect Thornheart. Allow me to tell you about the famous </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Drissian Icemint</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It has the bizarre effect of making your throat feel chilly despite the warmth of the drink. You’ll rarely find it out here as it needs to be bathed in purple moonlight to prevent deterioration. Now, there’s also heavy mint found on the slopes of Oker, those are called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">heavy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> because…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmN2MxNGE1M2JkMTQxMGU4MjQzNzBiNzI0NDNlNzc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena blinked another three times as her brain was overheating. Of… of all times! Of all people! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was who Amelia had just chosen to be her new friend!? Madness! Pure madness! She was dating a madwoman! A crazy, unstoppable madwoman!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjQ2ZTA0YTUzZDRkNGE4MDhjZTgwMDYwZTg3OGQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She slowly turned her head, making eye contact with Greatlord Oshiro, whose face was a little paler than she’d ever seen before.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGY5ODBmNmU5MTQwNjM4MjgxZDIzZjdlZmRkYjg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s going on?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena asked with her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTRmYWU5NzczNTQxOGU4NTBhNTUwMjM1MTIzOTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t want to know</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Greatlord’s eyes responded. The demon broke eye contact before turning and looking out the window. Serena looked into nothingness. Was she dreaming? Was she going to wake up any moment?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjc4OGE2OTllZjQ0ZTNiMjEyMDg1ZmU4ZDFlODA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s start with Noburu,” the Imperial Investigator quietly said to Chesterfield, bringing Serena back into reality. “We need to explore the exact extent of his mistwalking. If it’s something we can handle without establishing precautions within the Shimmer, then we won’t need to occupy too much of our Lord Guardian’s time.” The Imperial Investigator looked up from his papers in the direction of Amelia and her new best friend who were busy discussing the varieties and brewing differences of northern mint. “Umm… then we’ll talk to this Miss San and cross-reference our information.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGYyYmQzZTQyMzRiNzBiODNiNTI0NDkyYzBjMGQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re the expert,” Chesterfield nodded. He turned and gestured towards Serena. “Lord Halen, over here if you could.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGU4NDY1OGM5MzQ1YmZhZTBlMDNlNGEyMTIxOGVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… yes,” Serena answered, her voice weaker than she would have liked. No, that wouldn’t do. Hadn’t she promised herself she would move forward with Amelia till the end? Ridiculous situations like this were bound to appear in the future; she couldn’t lose her composure at each and every one! “What is it?” she asked, her voice recovering its usual resoluteness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTdmYTU4ZDYwMjQ0ZDY4MjdiNDgwZTJkNjU1MTFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s right. She was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Halen, soon to be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Commodore Halen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! Talented Speaker and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">war hero</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! Who was she to get unnerved by her girlfriend befriending a demon that could call upon more Imperial power with one wave of his hand than the entire Eastern Admiralty could?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTMwZmNjODFmMTQyMmJiYjcyNzJjOTE1MTAyMzM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah… she was getting a headache.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjQwMGNkMWE5MTQ0YzM4NTE5N2Q2ZGRkNGQ3MTY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“During the following interrogations, please focus on the personality and temperament of our two thieves,” Chesterfield’s face had its usual easy-going smile. “I would like to hear your evaluation afterwards.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDY5YTZiY2I1OTQ3NzM5YWE4MTc5YTE3MmQxMTAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Of course.” Serena bowed. She wasn’t sure exactly why.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTk3YTI3Y2UyMDQwNmE4ZjU0NmZmNjhlMzdiNTlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Halen,” the Imperial Investigator intoned, bowing towards her. “Akechi Kogoro. Pleased to make your acquaintance. May I say how honoured I am to meet someone with your achievements? You’ve managed what I could only dream of in the skies.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzc5NWNhYzUwNTRiMzNhNjNhYzM0NDcyMTkxNTM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena eyed the man for a moment. “You served?” she asked, noting his familiar posture and bearing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjRjYjlkNTMzOTQ0ODY5NDcyOTgwZTQxMGFlMTdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did - four years under Greatlord Kiyoshi. I remember hearing your name for the first time when you were made Captain of the Black Ship. Who could have expected the string of victories that would follow your appointment? Nevertheless, I did not have the stomach to face the action you did. I know my way around people better than I ever understood my gun or sword.” He tapped the Imperial insignia on his chest. “Now I serve her in a manner more fitting to my talents.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2E0NGI2OWE0MTQyZWQ5MDRmNzBkMmFjNGYyMGIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Investigator Kogoro, I will remember your name,” Serena affirmed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmU1YzJkNmU4YjRkNDM4OWMxZWYxMjAwMDUzMTg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s an honour, Lord Halen.” He bowed, and when he straightened, his eyes widened slightly, lingering on something just past Serena’s shoulder. She turned, and only by the mightiest effort did she not jump in surprise at the Lord Guardian standing just behind her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDBmNzhkY2Y1NTRmYzFiZWFlMzk1NjczYWEwYzEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sipping his tea.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTdiYjJlN2E5NTQ3MGVhZGRmZDlhMDM3NGNlYWE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So we don’t know how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">deep</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> he can go?” The Lord Guardian enquired, his voice returning to a low growl.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTc1ZjQwYmVhNDQ2YWRiYWU4N2RkZjM4ZjY5MmZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not yet,” Chesterfield replied. “Once we make him aware there is no escape, we’ll have him demonstrate his mistwalking. Once again, thank you for taking time out of your schedule, Lord Guardian.” Chesterfield bowed. The man was oddly polite to the towering figure. Not that he wasn’t polite to Serena, but she sensed that politeness was superficial, sometimes even bordering on mocking. The tone in which he spoke to the Lord Guardian was genuine.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGY3MzgzMTM1NjRhNTc4ODdiYjg5OWE1Nzg4Zjdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We would’ve been involved one way or another. You were lucky I was already in Asamaywa.” The Lord Guardian downed the remainder of his drink and set aside the teacup. “Lord-Prospect Thornheart,” he said. “Pay as much attention to me in there as you would towards anyone else. You might learn something.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjFhNWI3Njg1MjQ0OTY4ZjYxZjUyZmRkM2I5NTcw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-right!” Amelia nodded, flashing a thumbs up, before quickly hiding it and not so smoothly transitioning to a bow. “Thank you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjNlMzE5ZDRkMzRjN2Q4MjdmYWM5Y2U4Y2I1ZmE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go, Investigator.” The Lord Guardian left the room, quickly followed by Investigator Kogoro. A few moments later, they stepped into the room below. The mage inside was focused intently on her spell and fell out of her chair in shock when she realised a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Guardian</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was next to her. After a quick performance of frantic bowing and apologies, she soon left the sleeping Noburu alone with the Investigator and the Lord Guardian.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzNmNWFjYjNiYjQ5NmI4M2ZjZjkyMWEyYTIyMjBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The enormous demon took up position behind Noburu. His piercing eyes seemed to lock onto Amelia before turning towards the floor as if looking for something.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzgxZGRmNjE2NjRmNjk4YzRiNWYwM2YzYmI5MTc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, he vanished.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTI4Mjk3MzgxODQ5MWQ4MWNmYTU3ZTc0ZTU2OGYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Serena had just been informed about the Shimmer and mistwalking, seeing it first-hand was entirely different. How… was that even possible? To do something so incredible with no burst of aether or noise? One moment, he was there, and the next, he wasn’t. As the thought formed in her mind, so did a memory of when someone had spoken very similar words to her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzI5MjliNWZkMjQ0YjQ5NzlkOWUyM2U2N2ZjMTFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm… the human was not here and then she was.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM1Mzc2Yjk1NDNiZTQxMzhhZTFjYjhmMjBjNjM4ODVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was what Anathor told her when Amelia first appeared in her quarters onboard the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Is this how it happened? Did Amelia travel through the Shimmer? Did someone aid her?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmVkYjQzZjUxZDRhMDBhMWNmOTU1YzE2YTQzNTc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow…” Amelia muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjE0NWVhYzJiMjRjMDM5NzMyNDAyYjJhMmZmMzg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impressive,” Greatlord Oshiro intoned.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTljMmI5OWZkNjQxY2ZhY2ZjYTFkZjQwNGQ4OTA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesterfield merely chuckled softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWM1ZjM3ZmVmNzQ0NGFhYWQ0YmU0MDg0YTYxMGNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena didn’t have time to say anything. Investigator Kogoro reached over and used ammonia salts to shock Noburu awake.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Njc5ZjBiNDFlMDQ0OGI4YmRkZTY2ZTc1ZWY4OGNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah!” Noburu cried, his eyes flicking open.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDRiMWEyZTU0MjRkNTliZDM3ZjYwNWJlZjM0NmU3" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, Noburu,” Investigator Kogoro said with a smile. “Before we start, I must warn you: If you use your blessing without my permission, you will die. Do you understand?”</span></p>

This could be a human, demon, flora, fauna or something else. Maybe a famous building in Asamaywa could be named after you, or a method of brewing loqua. Whatever you have in mind, stop by the series </span><a href="https://discord.gg/YnvN9UKBHp" rel="ugc nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">Discord</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and double-check with me whether it’s appropriate before subscribing!</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Sixty-Six: Noburu's Interrogation</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM0MTNjZDA5MTdhYzRlN2ViN2NkMDE4MzE4NDFkYWU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block" width="600"/><br/>Investigator Kogoro wasn’t lying when he said he was good with people. It was an expertly conducted interrogation, leaving no room for the thief to hide. Their conversation was recorded with an Axiom Crystal, and from her position in the observation deck, Serena could see a truth-teller crystal embedded in a position Noburu couldn’t see. It was exactly the same approach she used when interrogating Amelia in her cell.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjVlYTFlZTI0ODRkYzViNDYzYmMwMDdjMjZjMGNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, Noburu tried to deflect and began to conjure up a half-baked story. Kogoro was having none of that nonsense, bringing him back on track, tactfully bringing up a new piece of information that shattered Noburu’s attempts at evasion. The first thing Kogoro established was who else was involved. While Noburu quickly gave up the name of the gang leader who orchestrated the theft, a man known only as Yoshiro, he was surprisingly resistant to giving any information regarding Seonmi.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGVlNmI1YWM5YzQyNGQ5YzVlYzIwMjE3ZDMxNjY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps they were a couple?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWY1NWY5ZTViYjQxYTRhMTgzN2JkMGRiMzIwM2Mz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t until Kogoro named Seonmi and informed Noburu that she was next door that the thief finally gave up any hope of deceiving the investigator. After Noburu was fully convinced that he wasn’t getting out of the situation easily, he became far more forthcoming. Kogoro had him start again from the beginning, in excruciating detail, starting with his life in the slums.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjQ2YjI3ZjI4MzQ2ZGE5ZjExNjRjYWVhYjA3ODhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You cannot understand what it’s like,” Noburu emphasised. “In the winter, people freeze to death in the alleyways! Their throats are cut for what little they own! Everyone’s struggling! We live in one room because we don’t have enough firewood! It’s nothing like what you have here in the city!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTNhYjQxNGEyMzRmODBhZWIwNTA4MTBkMjI1Zjgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth-teller showed no sign of red, so at the very least, Noburu believed in what he was saying. He was pleading with the investigator, trying to elicit sympathy. Despite the green light, Serena struggled to find herself convinced by his words. Even if his conditions were difficult, why wouldn’t he find work in the lowlands? Weren’t these all just excuses so he could justify taking an easy life of crime? How could he value his honour so little?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWQ1YWY2MGVhMDRjMTY4YzQ4ZWQ4Njc2NmQxMjRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was the kind of weak man Serena looked down upon.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDdkYjVkNTdjNTQ1YTRhODY0MDZmOWJmMzgwMzNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned to her left to see Greatlord Oshiro frowning at Noburu, his face tense. To her right, Amelia’s eyes had grown wide, and her face was the pinnacle of sympathy. Of course, Amelia would be sensitive to this kind of thing. Humans were more emotional than demons, and Amelia wore her emotions on her sleeve.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDNhYzM5MjJmNzRiOGRhYWU0NWNmZTFkM2U5MDk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Investigator Kogoro showed no sign of annoyance at Noburu’s excuses and instead chose to build rapport by saying, “Of course, we understand that you had no choice.” He continued the back and forth, with Noburu slowly relaxing. It paid off, as he didn’t hesitate to provide information regarding his blessing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2ExZGVhOTI2MTQzYzNiNTY3MjI2N2Y4ZDVjODEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It first happened when I was ten,” Norubu explained. “I was hiding from the director. He wanted to cane me because I fought another boy. I was hiding in a closet, and as he was calling my name, coming closer and closer, I prayed he wouldn’t notice me and then…” Noburu clicked his fingers. “It just happened.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGNkMTJmMGExNDQ2NWVhMDNmNDE3MzMyNWNhNzZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They continued on the subject of his mistwalking for a while longer, trying to establish the frequency and limits of Noburu’s ability. He had some fascinating descriptions of the Shimmer - what he called the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ghostworld</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWY1OTU2ZDU3YjQ1ZmI4NzQ3N2I1ZWY4ZDE2MmI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s this plant life he’s talking about?” Serena asked quietly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDQzN2U1Mzc3ZjQ5NmM4MWMxYzAyMDY0ZGIxOTZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Shimmer contains some interesting and often dangerous flora and fauna,” Chesterfield answered, sipping his tea. “The plants feed on aether, but too much will burn them away. It’s a delicate ecosystem. Most Mistwalkers are already powerful enough to protect their aether from the plants.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWFlNDI2NDg3NDQ0NmI5MDU5OGVjOWZlODZmMTQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that’s why there’s none in the academy but loads outside where the students don’t use aether!” Amelia exclaimed before frowning. “But… I didn’t see any plants when I first saw the Shimmer in the Wilderness. Shouldn’t a place with no human, I mean, demon activity, practically be a jungle?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTc5ODdjODQwZTQzYTJhOWZkMzI4ZDE3MGRmYWM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your embodiment of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> would have burned it all away. Probably for a few kilometres.” Chesterfield looked at Amelia, blinking twice. “Not to worry, it grows back quickly.” He took a slow sip, turning his attention back to Noburu. “There’s a small amount of evidence that it may cause psychosis in certain people. Nothing definite, but enough that we have to be careful with our thief.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTI5Y2I1ZjgzODRmMWM5MzM4M2I5ZDE1YWUzOWEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena looked down at Noburu. “Is this why you asked for my evaluation of his temperament?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDBiMjVkZGQ1ZTQwY2I5MzFiNTMwNTI1OTZlNzU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Partially.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzY0ZDZmMzcyYTQ5NjQ4NjgzODk3Mjg0ZWY4Mjgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The interrogation continued, and Serena devoted her full attention to Noburu and the investigator’s methods. She could learn a few things from him. Kogoro was teasing out every little bit of detail, often making Noburu backtrack and retell the same events again. Sometimes, he would suddenly jump to something Noburu had recalled happening several days before, then return to last night's theft. It was a technique familiar to Serena; keeping Noburu’s mind constantly moving to different places in the timeline prevented him from being able to form any coherent lies.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWQwZjYzYTdiMjQ4NTRhNGI0NTdhODQzZGZhNWVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kogoro had Noburu retell his version of events regarding his capture by Amelia. As he did so, he said something that seemed too odd to make up on the spot. He said he’d been chased and almost killed by a mysterious woman who also possessed the power of mist walking.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmQ2NmVkZGUyNzQ0ZGY4ZTVmODNlNzhiY2NhOGM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Strangely enough, a woman dressed as a maid.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGNhMjhhYjBkMzQzNGU5ZTgyMTY4MWVlMTNkMGE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth-teller showed green.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjI4NzY1YzhkMzRhNTdhYzkyYzVlMGNlM2E0Mjk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One of your agents?” she asked Chesterfield, raising an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWI0ZmI4Nzc3NzQ1NmNiZGJhYTM4YmRkOWYxYjNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Someone I’m aware of,” he replied definitively, refusing to elaborate further.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODA0ZjVlYzBiZTQ3OWE5MzZjYTNmOGE0ODM0OWMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now I think it’s time for a demonstration,” Kogoro said, relaxing and folding his hands. “As you know, you’re not the only one with this ability. Right now, there is an individual waiting for you in the Shimmer. Not this </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">maid</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you’ve talked about - a colleague of mine. Any escape attempt from this room or anywhere else will be impossible. Kindly save us all the bother and don’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">try</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWU0MGQzOGM4MzQyOTNhMjgyZTI1MmJjYThlOTQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Alright,” Noburu muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTg3MDRkOTZhYjRmMThhYzg5N2ZlYzdlOTk1YjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, in your own time. The person in the Shimmer will inform you when to return.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWVkNDVjNTVhYzQ0MGQ5ZGE0ZDMxMWNkZmE0NTdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu’s eyes flicked nervously around the room. Then, he took a few deep breaths before taking a final enormous one. Serena strained her senses, pushing her aura into yellow, enhancing her perception of the aetherfield as much as possible. To her left, Greatlord Oshiro was doing the same.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGEzOGZkNWQwYTRiNDZiOTIyY2FhOTgyYTI2YTNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with a loud snapping sound, Noburu disappeared. Was there perhaps…? Maybe she picked up on the faintest </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ripple</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> emitting from the activation of his blessing, but beyond that, there was nothing. No, that wasn’t quite right. A subtle smell lingered in the air, originating from the room below.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjk1NWQ0MWNmMTQwMmRhZjhlZDNmOThiZTlhNTBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It smelled like burned toast.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjQzNTNiNWJjNDQzYzY4ZjAzNzUzMGUwYjcxYjBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu reappeared in his chair a minute later with another loud snap. Only this time, the Lord Guardian also appeared. Where Noburu’s face was white as a sheet and breathing heavily, the massive demon seemed unaffected by his extended stay in the Shimmer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWJiNTUxODg5YjQ4NDhhYTlhZGIyMmRkNWFmY2Vk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weak,” growled the mountain of a man. “Superficial. No more than a grade two. There is little threat from this one.” He placed a giant hand on Noburu’s shoulder, making the man jump. “He might have potential as a warrior, but he will never Speak a Word.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDQyZmIxY2JlZjRiNTQ4YjY2ODI1ZGM5YjY1YzUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Lord Guardian.” The Investigator bowed his head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDFhMjgxZDAwMzRmZWNiM2Q4ZjQ1NTlhOWUyMzY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will return to my original duties now, Investigator,” The Lord Guardian intoned before turning his gaze towards the observation deck. “Lord-Prospect Thornheart, I hope you learned a lot.” With that said, the man looked at the ground for a moment and vanished into the Shimmer, his mistwalking utterly absent the loud snapping sound Noburu’s version produced.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODk1YmIyYjg1ZTQ2M2RhNjNlOWMyOTRmMDI4Yjg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A long silence ensued before Noburu eventually asked, “What’s going to happen to me?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTAyZThlMjhjZjRmZWFiZDNhNDE0M2FiYTM4YTgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well,” Kogoro began. “As a man as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">smart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as you might have guessed, your blessing means we have to handle your past, present and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">future</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> activity with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sufficient</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> care.” Even from a high angle, Serena could see the edges of a sly smile on the investigator’s face. “While you’ve committed no small list of offences, enough to have you donate every finger of yours… You haven’t yet done anything as egregious as murder, have you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTU4YjhmYWM1YjQyYTBhNDFkNTRiOGQ2MmM4MWVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No! I haven’t!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWQyMDM1YjBhZjRiNDM5MTQzN2ZmNDhmYTAyMzVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena watched carefully as the truth-teller crystal turned green.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTBkYjMxNWY5NTQzNDI4YzA5N2M5NDQxYjNhMzg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lucky for you, I believe you,” Kogoro said. “Otherwise, this conversation would end with you taking a small step with a long rope.

<p class="cnM2OGU3YzU2YmMxMzQ0OTI4YTBiNGI2YTVkZGFiMWU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, I’ll do anything you want,” Noburu reached out with his hands, his face desperate. “I’ll do whatever work or task you want, just please, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">please</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, look after Kiku and the kids…” His voice became shameful and weak. The performance made Serena click her tongue. The audacity of this man to try and demand </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">anything,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> given the situation he was in!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2MwYWZhNjgyMTQ2NWVhY2Q1NzFlOTI4NDU0NjIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes… the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">orphanage</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Investigator Kogoro sighed. “You do understand neither you nor your sister have any legal right to that building? You’ve been illegally squatting in a property owned by your Lord Superior.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjA1ZjM2MTU4ODRhNzE5Zjk4ODA2NDA1YjcwZDIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please…” Noburu pleaded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTZiNzU5NzljNzRjZTFiZThmMTY5NGU4MjE2M2Y4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have guards securing the location,” Kogoro explained. “They’ll keep things in order until we decide what to charge you and your sister with. I don’t-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjhkZDEwOGQ1NzRhY2NhNjU1ZDI1YmI1MjMyNzM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!?” Noburu blurted out, his eyes widened. “What guards!? Who!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjY3MTZhNWY0NTRlOWU4ODU3ZGY2ZTczNDc1NDI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kogoro paused. Serena felt herself frown. She imagined he would protest at the possibility of his sister facing charges. Throughout the interrogation, his consideration and care for his only family member was authentic. Why would he object to the guards and not the charges?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmI1Y2IwMzA3NTRhZGFiNWNmZWQ0MGQ4MzcxNDEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...The lowland guards,” Kogoro answered. “The ones who maintain order in the slums. I’m sure you’ve encountered them-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjIzNTEyYzdiMTQ4MTU4YWZiZTBhZTE2YmFkODgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!” Noburu yelled, his voice suddenly full of force. “T-the guards are no more than another gang! They take bribes and dish out beatings a-and even make people disappear! They extort money from us for protection! If it’s just the lowland guards, then my sister isn’t safe!” His voice became pleading again. “There’s one guard, named Yasuji. He’s always had his eyes on her! Please! She couldn’t possibly fight him off! She’s weak! She has a chronic illness that-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjFkY2RkNDJmMjRlNDNiMTNhODI4MzJiMTJiZjhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enough!” Kogoro snapped, banging the table. “If this is true, why didn’t you bring this up earlier? You didn’t mention these guards’… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">activities </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">when we covered your experiences in the slums. Why not?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2I3MGFlZDVlMDQ3ZDJiMDZjM2RiMDhkZjhjYzEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because it never works!” Noburu protested. “People have tried before. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">tried! You people don’t want to hear about it! People are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bribed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to ignore the problems, all so the Lord can fill his pockets with our-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTRlMmQ4MWYwZjRmYjFiZDQ3MGZlY2RmMDliMGVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Enough!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” shouted Kogoro, launching himself to his feet. “I will not sit here and listen to you besmirch a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Cascadian Lord! </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Insolence!” He glared at Noburu, boring holes into him until the thief shrivelled back into his chair, muttering an apology.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWFiNmJiYjdmYzQxMWE4MTM1ZDZmNDRlZjg3YmNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, no one could deny the green light emitting from the truth-teller.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjcyYTZiNGYyZTQ0NmY5NDU3ZDZmYjgwYjllNmUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll return shortly.” Kogoro left the room, his face tense.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWI3NTJjMDA3ZTQ0NTRiMjdiNzk4ODQ4ZTI2MjEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm,” Greatlord Oshiro hummed. A deep frown had formed on his forehead. “Under me, Highlord Yasuda controls the ingress and egress of the plateau lifts and under him…” The greatlord paused for a moment. “...Lord Kanamori is charged with maintaining order in and around the Asamaywa lowland station. These slums would be under his purview.” He clicked his tongue. “Highlord Yasuda is a great man. I do not believe he would let this happen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzAwYzMxODJhYjQzOTY5MTI1ZTNiZTk5OWRhNjg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you know Lord Kanamori well?” Chesterfield asked. “The system of prospecting candidate lords is designed to filter out those who value their gold more than their duty, but occasionally people slip through. Or…” He crossed his arms, tapping his elbow with a finger. “Or they make it through and are then corrupted later. Greatlord Oshiro, do you think Lord Kanamori may have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lost his honour?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzdjNTQzNzBjZDRjYzI5MTRjYjNhMzdhNGJjNmE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The greatlord was silent for a long time before speaking.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjFjMWNmZWYwYTQ5MDg5NmNmNjMzMDkzNzljNjE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It… is possible.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzI1NTZhMDAxZTQwNjU5NjlhNTQ0ZjY5MWM0OTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“His honour may be intact,” Serena pointed out. “This corruption may lie only with the guards, reaching no higher.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDQ2ZWM0ZjkxYzQyOTBhZTAzNmRjOTNhYWQ2ZWYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We will see…” Greatlord Oshiro whispered. The room had become oddly cold.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWVhZGE3Mzc2YzQwYzBiNzYwMjBkOTkxZjlmZTQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena glanced at Amelia, who was still staring at Noburu below. “Amelia?” Serena asked. “What does your intuition tell you about this man’s claims? I know the truth-teller showed green, but what do you think?” Amelia didn’t answer immediately, looking at Serena, then back down, then back at Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDkwMjA4MGFhYzQ2YjQ4YTVjYjVmNjAxNjA5MGU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A… chronic illness?” she asked softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjNhMDExMTdjZjRmN2M5NDkwNTA4YmI2ZDQzNDE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” Serena frowned before realising. “Oh, the sister. Even if it’s true, it’s likely an excuse for his actions. He- </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">oh</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…” Serena trailed off as she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">realised</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the true nature of Amelia’s thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2M1MmM0NTZiZDQwMWJiNGI0YzA5NjA4OTYwZTMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The one singular time Serena had seen Amelia speak with a voice of passionate disgust was when she first told Serena about the condition her body had suffered in her previous life. Even now, Serena remembered the name and description. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Chronic Endothelial Collapse Syndrome</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. A condition that weakens the host's blood vessels, leading to organ failure and death. Despite the advanced - almost magical - technology of Amelia’s world, it was often fatal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTExYTc3MGFhODQyM2M4YWNmOWQ4MGE3NjdlNTI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure we can-” Serena began, interrupted by the door opening.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2I4ODhmZjFlOTQxNGQ4YmU0NGZkMDBhNWE4MGIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lords of the East, my sincere apologies.” Kogoro bowed deeply. “The man’s passion likely caused him to believe his own words. The honourless often live in delusion, as they say. I also should not have lost my temper. I couldn’t bear to hear his insults.” He bowed again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzk0ZTViNzU4ZjQ3MTg5MDU1YzAzYmFmMjY2ZjZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My good man,” Chesterfield intoned. “You know as well as I that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">passion</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> doesn’t fool a truth-teller, whether in crystal, demon, or even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> form. These are concerning allegations, and you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">will not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> be brushing them under the rug.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2ViYWNjNDA3MjQ1MDJiZGNiNzMxZWY1N2I3MGMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Yes, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmM2NjQ1MTgwYjQ1MDg4YWZmNjhjNWY5NmQ0NDM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could you give us some privacy, Investigator Kogoro? I have some matters to discuss.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmMyNTc3NzIyNTQ1ZjliYzY3NTg1NTM0NTAyN2Nm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, sir. I will prepare for the next interrogation.” Kogoro bowed, leaving the room. As the door closed, Chesterfield turned towards Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTg2ODdjNjljZTQ2MDFhYWEyNTk2YWQ4OTcwMWY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, Lord Halen, what is your understanding of this man’s temperament?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGY0ZjExYzNmNzQzZWQ5NDNjMTM5MWNjOWFlNDdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Poor control of his anger. Highly resentful of his superiors.” Serena gave her candid understanding. “Blames others for his failures. Yet…” She paused, trying to find the right words. “He’s bold, willing to take risks to protect the ones he loves. He’s stupid but could likely be whipped into shape.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDlhZjhlOTMzMzQ1OTdhMmNlMmQ2NmY2ODFkNGIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Short and sweet,” Chesterfield replied, taking his time to pour a new cup of tea and savouring the taste. “Oh my, the Lord Guardian does know his leaves, doesn’t he?” Returning to the window, he asked, “Should we desire to whip this man into something useful… who should hold that whip?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzUwMWFjODg5NDRhMDU4OWM1OTk5NDVjZTRiZjM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Someone who can earn his respect,” Serena answered. “He clearly doesn’t respect the work of his Lord Superior, so it would be better to have someone who can demonstrate strict but fair discipline. If you are too harsh on him, it’ll reinforce his existing prejudices.” She shook her head. “I’ve seen it in sailors before. Ah, that’s an idea. Find a ship and put him on it. Keep him there with a fair wage he can send to his sister… and then… eventually…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2ZhZWU1YTgwYTRjNDliYTcwY2Y2ZTFmMDgxZTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at Chesterfield.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODljODFiOTU0ODRjMWFhMWEyYmYzODUyNjUyOTc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesterfield looked back, his eyes twinkling.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWFiMDQ0MGJkMDRlMjNhMDY3YmYxZjdhMThhMmY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena blinked three times.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDFlNjdlMmUwYzRhM2Q5MDZjNDA5ZDgyN2VlMjVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This bastard!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTgyYTJiZTk1NzRmNTQ4MTNiYWVhMmUxYmY5NWNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You-” Serena coughed, catching the swear word before she could utter it in the presence of Greatlord Oshiro. “The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">a penal ship. We do </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">take conscripts.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjA3Nzg4ZWJkODQzY2E4MjRkMTY3MmFlMjQ0YjRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">a penal ship,” Chesterfield echoed. “But you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">do </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">take conscripts. At least now you do. More specifically, you will be taking these two, well…” Chesterfield nodded down the observation deck towards the windows overlooking Seonmi’s room. “As long as Miss San down there hasn’t committed any heinous murders, she’ll also be joining your crew.” He took a slow sip of his tea, raising a hand to halt the protest Serena was about to unleash. “I think a skilled confidence trickster and a mistwalker would be a valuable addition to this elite team of yours. You’ll need a wide range of abilities in the future, more than your cannons and swords can provide.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTBmNGI4NWZiYjQ1ZWU4MTcyMWZkZDBjN2M3NDQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’ll run,” Serena countered. “At the first opportunity. The moment they hide away enough wages. Hell, they’ll steal what they can and flee.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGJlOTEyZmZkZTQ1ODY5ZWNlOTBkYmYzMTVhZDdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Chesterfield waved his hand. “We’ll control their finances. As for preventing any further acts of dishonour… Well, for Noburu, we can guarantee his loyalty by protecting his sister and those children.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDFkNDlhMWI4NzRkMDBiNTQzNzYwODEwY2UxZGNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bought loyalty isn’t real loyalty. It won’t last the deafening terror of battle.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjFjNGM2OTk3YjQzYTVhNjdmNWJkNWNiMWMzYjZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, of course,” Chesterfield said with a sigh. “That said, we hope you won’t be subjecting them to</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> terror</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> anytime soon. As I mentioned before, you’ll be staying within Imperial borders. At first, anyway.” He chuckled before continuing, “As for Seonmi, we’ll offer her the position as Head of House San, should she earn enough accolades in your service.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDA0ZDMzODM0YzQ2MmFiNWExZmJlMGU3ZmI1ZDVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena clenched her teeth. This… this was what Greatlord Oshiro realised earlier! How could she have been so blind!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDU2MzMyNWMwNTRkMGM5MTI5ZTcxMWEyMzlhNWZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before we argue, let’s not forget the shocking allegations your new crew member has made,” Chesterfield turned to the window. “Corrupt guards accepting bribes and running a protection racket? A chronically ill woman under threat? What should be done about this, Lord Halen?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2IzNzBiNzY1ZjQ3OGFhNWUwNmIyY2JmYTVjODVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…” Serena began, not missing the wobbling of Amelia’s eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzU5NzdlNWUzNzRkNDI4MGZlYjg5YTc1ODE0MTk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think you should make your way to this orphanage with all due haste.” Chesterfield kept his back towards her, his face partially reflected in the window. “We can’t have Noburu’s family harmed if we hope to persuade his loyalty by assuring him we can keep them </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">unharmed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Hmm…” He rubbed his nose. “Plateau lift </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">five</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> will bring you closest. It should be a short walk there. If you leave now, you should catch an outside-line tram.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzIzYWViZTJlNjQzMDViZWY5YmViZGEzMGU4NGJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...I’ll leave immediately.” Serena half-bowed to Chesterfield and then produced a deeper bow towards her greatlord.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGU4ZjMyMTZkMDRmODViNzM3OGQ3ZjllYTE1MmU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And…” Chesterfield continued. “Take Lord-Prospect Thornheart with you. She should witness all aspects of our society, don’t you think? The good, the bad… and the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fixable</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” His eyes met Serena’s through the window’s reflection. He gave her a subtle nod, which she returned.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTU4NDFhYmMwMjQ1NjBiY2Q2ODI0MTBmNWE2YjA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia, let’s go,” Serena commanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGUzZjJkYTM3NDRhM2I5MTU2MGY5NmY2ZTRjOTA2" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-sure!”</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Sixty-Seven: Saint Amelia</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNiMzk0NTJiNWNiZDRlZjQ4ZmNiMzU3M2YyZDk5MTlj"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2NjMTI3OTQwZjQyYzA5MWIyZDI1YzI3NWUxMzgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The plateau lift belched steam as its massive gears turned, carrying Serena and Amelia towards the lowlands. Stretched across the horizon before them were the developing lands of towns and farming communities. Serena had been gone from Asamaywa for only a year, but even in such a short amount of time, the amount of industry that had sprung up was astonishing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTUwZTRhMDA5OTQ4MTRiZmJiYWI2ZDc5MDU2Yzgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While the sight of the beautiful lowlands, bathed in blue hues from the enormous moon above, along with skies striated with travelling transports and military ships, would normally have Amelia asking a hundred questions while squealing about how amazing everything was…</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTdhYzlkYzkzZDQxODJhMWZlMjk3OWNlMjAyMTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, she was quiet. Both of them were.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGFmZjcyZWFjODQ0MTVhM2IxZjc5NTNjNDlmOTMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You understand why he wanted you to come with me?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzQxZDJlYjc1ZDQ3YjY4N2M3ZTg0NGE0YWJmNDY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Yeah,” Amelia replied, her voice quiet under her rainhat. They were both wearing hats and coats to cover their uniforms. This wasn’t a time to be visible or flashy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTJjMzRiNWE5MjRhNGZhZmRiNjlhN2NmNmJlZDcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Keep it… discreet.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTMyNmU0MzhiNTRjY2FhN2EwMjFlMDM1NWU0Y2Ey" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will,” Amelia replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzRmYTYwY2IxNjQ4OGZiYmY5YmYyNzE5ZGU3NmY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you can’t just help everyone, remember? You might want to, but it’ll cause untold problems and-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGYyYWU1MGYxNzQxMDdiNWNjMDI1OGMwNmQ3M2Zm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, alright!” Amelia tutted. “You don’t have to tell me everything!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjE3ZDA1YTJjZTRmNDJiZTVkMGY3ODMyOGU0NDhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry,” Serena said. “I’m just… tense.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDQyYWEwZWI1ZDQ3M2JiNDBhNWEzNzA0ZmEwOGEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So am I.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjJmOTQ0OTc0NzQ3MzhhZDRhOTVjMWQ0NGQ0NjQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena wanted to discuss the Lord Guardian with Amelia, but the time and place felt inappropriate. So, with Serena mentally vowing to conduct a thorough cheek-pulling session later, they rode in silence down towards the lowlands. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTBjYjk4NjU3NjRhY2M4ZDZjYTUwYmFmYjg0YjAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Stepping off, she was treated to what could best be described as disorderly order. A bustling market, targeting the travellers moving to and from the train station, produced a symphony of sounds as stall owners fought with their voices to catch the attention of passersby. People were well dressed, and she saw happy smiles on the faces of many.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjI1NTJmMWU3NDQ0OGFhNWUxYTAyZTE0MjM3Nzcw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She could see half a dozen guards and station employees maintaining order and keeping the lift queues moving. She saw people clambering on the rooftops, placing wooden sheets over the tiles to prevent damage from the incoming moon rain. The storefronts were also boarding up their glass and paper windows. The trains would stop soon, and air traffic would shut down for the night. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzg2MmUxYzI1NTQ2OTVhZGFkOWYwZTRiZjU4Y2Jm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, come on, keep it moving!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTVmNGI5ZTFiYzQ5NzliMGViZDBhOTIxNDM4Y2Vl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No ma’am, the last train to Nachon left half an hour ago.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWY1NGFkZGZjODQ2M2Y4OTJlYWM2ZmY2NzI2YjQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speak to us if you need shelter tonight! Don’t get caught out! Cheapest rates!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWI3ZGY4MTdjMjRhZWNhZWIxYjFkNzM3Mzg1MzUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Papa, the moon’s so big! Catch a big crystal for me!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjk4Yzg1ZDliYzQ2NzI5N2RlNDJhNGZkYmIzNjNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They turned off the main street and headed toward the orphanage. The first few streets they passed were lit with aetherlights, with clean cobblestone pathing. However, as they continued, the amount of people walking became fewer and fewer. The streets became narrower, and aetherlights no longer lit their way. Here, the building style started to change; the homes relied heavily on jettying to maximise floor space on their upper floors. In fact, after walking further into Asamaywa’s shadow, the jettying became so egregious that the upper floors of each side of the street were less than an arm's length apart. Not only did this invoke a strange sense of being trapped, but it limited the amount of sunlight reaching the ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTBiNDhmNWI0NjRhNzc5MTg3YTY1YmMxYjY0Mjhk" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huge fire hazard…” Amelia muttered, looking up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTNjMDhjOWU5YjQyYTlhNTkyMzAzMWNiMjBjMWM1" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OGZiOGUzNGRjODRmMmJhYTYwNmE3OGUzOGZkNjI4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGEzY2MwZmQzNTRhMzFhOGVkZjFiN2I3ZjIxYTRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This doesn’t seem so bad,” Serena intoned. Looking around, she didn’t see anything that couldn’t be found in the less affluent districts in the city above. The streets looked like they were still swept occasionally.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGRmMDFmN2JiMDRhMTliZDRjYzM0YWI3YmIzODkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She soon came to regret those words.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzgyNTQ1Y2M3MDRiY2RiYWJkMGM4ZDA0OTI4YmI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As they walked deeper, a change occurred. With the light barely reaching the ground, it was as if the world was slowly rotting away. Shop windows no longer used glass, and many were boarded up with wooden planks. The cobblestone paths gave way to gravel and dirt and the drainage channels on the sides of roads were filled with debris, looking like they hadn’t been cleaned in months.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MThlYTgzYTY4MTQzMjI5MmU2ZTc4OTc0OTYwMjY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They didn’t see a single guard patrol.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTc5ODhmY2JjMjRlNmRhMjMyZjYwYjA3MDU4NjM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere became ever more sullen. People stopped smiling or nodding as they passed; instead, they hurried past, casting wary looks. Although Serena’s and Amelia’s raincoats - borrowed from the Old Guard’s Headquarters - had plenty of signs of wear and tear, they were still noticeably better maintained than the patchwork clothing worn by the few residents they saw.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjEyYThlMmViNTRkMDQ4ZjZlNTIxMDQ0ZjY5Nzlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Beggars started appearing in most corners, their eyes devoid of any spark of life. More than a few had the shakes - a symptom of Dust addiction. They were seemingly content to rot away with the rest of the world. No, not the world. Slums. These were the slums. Where was the energy? It was winter, sure, but even in the poorer parts of Asamaywa, the winter markets would continue throughout the season, only stopping if they were truly snowed in.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTg1ZWE3YzhiNjRlMzliZWYzZTQ4NTg3ZGI2NWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They turned a corner to see a man being beaten by two others. His assailants were using their fists but carried crude bludgeons on their waists. Serena couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Where were the guards?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTkwZmY2Njc1NjQ3Mzg4MTgxOWJiZmE1Y2E5YWRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You there!” she shouted, striding down the alley. The two thugs stopped their assault, letting their victim fall into a crumpled heap where he lay shaking and unconscious. “On whose authority are you punishing this man?” She narrowed her eyes, glaring at the men.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmRlMzU2MzIwMjRhNzU5YThlYTU5ZTZkMDFjY2M3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Authority?” one of the men questioned, his head tilting.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzY2YTNkZWU3ODRhOThhYjI5N2RjNjc4MmFmOTIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This ‘ere is Marlos’s turf,” the other snarled, jabbing his finger to the floor. “Don’t stick yer pretty nose into our business, ladies.” He peered forward so he could see their faces better. “Oh! Yeh </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">are </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">pretty. Look at yer eyes! Born proper, were we?” He bent back up, tapping his bludgeon with a finger. “Highborn women like yeh should be careful. Why don’t yeh come with us ‘ere? We-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzYwODQyMTM5ODRjYWQ4NDU5YjUyMTY0OGNlMDA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before Serena could break the thug's hands, Amelia fired off two spells, causing the men to collapse into a magic-induced sleep. Her girlfriend looked at her and shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTA5NzUwOGE3ODRmMzFhMDI1NzZiMjQ0ZDA4YjM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry,” Amelia said. “Did you want to speak to them?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDBkMGI4YTY5MjQ4YmY4MjhmNDI0YzRiMWQ5YzVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...No,” Serena eventually answered. This wasn’t the right time for her to run about clearing out criminal gangs. While she had certain legal rights to do so, as a Speaker and a fully-sanctioned Cascadian Lord, it was considered offensive to do too much without consulting the lord responsible for the area.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjZkODIzZDU3NDQzNmFhZjMwODk3NmJmOWMwNGFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, I’m going to take your pain away, okay?” Amelia bent down. A tiny thread of golden light with dancing flecks of blue reached out from Amelia and entered the shivering, bloody man.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmRkM2E1OWEyZTQ2NjhiNGRhMGYyNTlmODllOWM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s much better at control now.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMzNWU2OGYyMGIwODQ3ZGJhZGVhYWJkOTdiZWNkZWIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The man’s cuts and bruises healed, leaving only dried blood on his body and clothes. Amelia’s magic took care of that, too. The man slowly stood, touching his clean body in disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmYxZTA1NzhiNzQ1NWI5YzI0OGMwY2FiMzhkMDQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… Who…” the man stuttered, his face full of confusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGU0ODBkMTEzYjRkMzViY2ZlZjBmNDY5NzAyYjhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suggest you leave,” Serena commanded. The man took a few hesitant steps back before turning and running down the road, his now immaculate patchwork clothing standing out against the dirt and grime of everything else.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWJiYmExNmNhNDRhZjJiMzk0ZTFiM2Q1MTNjZjVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t like this place,” Amelia mumbled. “It feels… oppressive.” She shuddered, rubbing her arms. “Should we do something?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWQyZDFiYTUyZjRhM2FhZDNmZGY1OTA4YzE4NzJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can’t just heal the entire slums,” Serena said, looking around. “This is beyond a quick fix. I’ll have to report this to Greatlord Oshiro. The conditions here are worse than I thought.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmQyNWU5Y2Q1NzQ2MGY5N2FiNTA4NTE3Nzc2ZmEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The residents thought they were subtle, but their attempts at hiding were no challenge for her aura-enhanced perception. They spied on them through little cracks in the doors and walls. When Serena made eye contact, they hurried away. She shook her head, saying, “Let’s go; we must have taken a wrong turn.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTczMTM0OGZmMDQ3YWM5MTdkZDhmYjgxMjM3MDBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about these guys?” Amelia poked one of the thugs with her foot.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWIyMzA2OTI5MDQ1ZGFiMWU4NTA1MTU4MTk5Nzhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena dragged them into a side alley and had Amelia release the sleep spell. It was cold, and they risked frostbite or worse if they stayed asleep. They would wake up in a few minutes confused, but other than that, no harm would come to them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Mjk3NWJlYjk5ODRiMTM5MTAzZDJlYWU0Zjk3MWFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, perhaps some should.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTQ2NTBlMjBhMTRjYzdhZmJlZDE5ODBkN2FlNGYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Continuing, they eventually came across a guard patrol. Although the guards seemed less interested in patrolling and more interested in chatting with each other, drinking alcohol from a flask. Their uniforms were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">mostly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> clean, but worn haphazardly. As if they didn’t value the duty that came with a uniform.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTEzMjA2MTEyMzRjNDFiYzQwMDFmMDAxMTcwYmEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You there!” Serena called. She strode towards them, slightly releasing her control over her red aura, allowing it to be easily visible. The guards reflexively placed their hands on their swords, but as she approached and her red aura became clear, their eyes took on a tinge of fear and awe. She gave them a quick description of the orphanage. “It should be nearby. Do you know it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjViZTAwNmFiZTQ1N2NhZDE4YWNiZDk1Zjg1MDZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Aye, we know it,” one of the guards eventually answered, his voice hesitant. “A squad was sent there earlier. Who are you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDYxZWM3NDUxODQ3ZDM4YzJkZjg5MzE3YzM2ZGI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaker Halen. I have business at the orphanage. Orders from my Lord Superior. Take us there.” At her words, the guard's eyes widened at the word </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDdjMzg0MzFhNjQ1NTRhNzM1N2VmNjc5N2FmNmQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGQzZGI4ZGYwNjQ2N2NhODE0YWExNGEzM2NmMTY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk!” She clicked her tongue. Where was the discipline? “Do you talk back to all your superiors, man?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWYxZGE0M2RlOTQzMmFhMWEwZTUzZjJkYjg1OGEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Captain needs-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmRiOTgzZWNjYzQ2ZmJhOTQzOTkzYzBkNGY1NTdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll have the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> before an Imperial Court for failing to maintain discipline amongst his guards!” Now, she was really channelling her captain persona.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmEyOTI0NjQ3NDRhMmY5Nzk0MmQ4NzZkMzdlZDI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon to be her commodore persona!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjYyNWM4Nzg3NDQ5ZGFhYzliYTFhZDRiM2Y1MjQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her threats worked, and the guard’s insubordination ceased. They lead them through the narrow, dark streets, casting the occasional glances at her and sometimes towards Amelia. With the rainhat, Amelia’s golden hair was hidden, and they wouldn’t necessarily assume she was a human. Demon horns came in all shapes and sizes. They would likely have assumed hers weren’t large enough to poke through the rainhat.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Njc5ZDlkOTk3NzRiMzI5MDI4ZDZmYjEyMWI3YzAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The darkness lifted as they entered an open space, where half a dozen stalls circled a long-defunct fountain. A few guards lingered around the square, and she even saw a gaggle of children running through with sticks, rolling wooden hoops. Despite the cold weather and their thin clothes, they were laughing. They looked skinny but not malnourished.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2I0MTUzYjMxMDQ0ZmQ5NTQ1Y2UwZTliMzY1Yzg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, it didn’t give her much hope.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTJjNDU4Zjg1ZTRlNjBhN2I2MzM0YWIzNDFmOGNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That there is the guardhouse, S-Speaker Halen.” The guard pointed at one end of the square, where a large building stood, one of the few around with sweeping roofs and decorative inlays. “It’s where the Captain's office resides. Are… you sure you don’t want to meet him? I-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzYyOTgzYzMxMDRmNGFiYTMyMGU3ZTdmNmEzYWFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The orphanage,” Serena reiterated.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGViZDM1N2I5ZTQ5ZDVhZDlmMDQzNzg3MTgzMmI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWQwMGMwOGZhNzQ5ZGFiNDdjYmNmMzViZmQzNjk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">From the guards she’d seen, not one of them was capable of aura. She knew the demands of the war had pulled aether-users from their positions into more suitable tasks, but to think an entire area like this would be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">stripped </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">of guards capable of actually fighting. What would they do if they encountered an ochimusha?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWI3YTAxZGM2YzQ1ZjE4OThkZmI2NTgyNjQ0OTVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As they exited the square, Serena asked, “Why is the rubbish left to pile up?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjYzOGM5MjBjNjQwNDA5Nzk5ODllYzMxMjU4Y2Q0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no money,” the guard answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjcxOTI3MDY2YzQ1MTBhYzRiMTI1MWE2ZTI5YjJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzkzMDQ5Y2NjODQ2YjlhYjEyMDQ2YTU5YjQwYTJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After turning a few corners, they reached their destination. It was just as Noburu described. The orphanage was a dilapidated building with a patchy roof and broken windows. It sat at the end of the street, with a wall extruding from it that enclosed some private space. Perhaps a garden. Smoke billowed from its chimney, and a bored-looking guard leaned in the entranceway.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2M3YTIxNmNkNTQzOWJhY2M1NWJiOTRhOGI3ZmY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside, she could hear the sound of things being broken.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGU5ZjFjMTJmYTQ3OTliMDA3ZDJlMmI3MTExMDRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Children yelling.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzQwYTMwZjJmMDQ1OGFhMzUwZWE4MzkwYzhlNjJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And crying.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTZmN2UxMzhlZDRiNjU4N2NhN2NkMDdlNzc0MjVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena strode up to the door, prompting the guard to step forward, his hand on his sword. The man’s eyes met hers before drifting to the guards guiding them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzAyZWQwODRkNzRjNTI4YTc3MWYyOWRiZmZhNmE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Who’s this?” he asked, directing his question to his colleagues.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDNlN2I1N2I1NDQ2M2U5NmUxZWU0NGQ5MjkwM2Zh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She calls herself Speaker Halen,” her guide answered, his voice unconfident.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTRkMTVmMGRmZjRjNzVhMzE4YTFlYjc0M2UzZjky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The door guard laughed, shaking his head. “You must be mad. No Speaker is going to come here.” He narrowed his eyes. “Who are you really, then? This is an official investigation! Don’t think about lying… to me…” He trailed off as Serena allowed her aura to be visible again, pushing it into orange.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGEyMzdiODE2MTQ1NzRhOTkyOTkwM2RjMDU2ZDRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He swallowed audibly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmI0MjU1YmZlZjQ4NjdhYzhkNTQ0NTJkMGQ5YWE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re conducting an investigation?” Serena asked, peering past the man. She could sense Amelia at her side, itching to run in.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWFjMmFiNGM1YjQ0MDg4NjI0MzAzNzEyYjQ0M2Qz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that’s right. Captain ordered us to secure this building. Keep the occupants, umm… secure.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzQ2ZTllNzc0NDQ3ZmJhOGIyMmZiMmVmYmM4OWRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why then,” Serena asked, keeping her voice flat. “Do I hear the sound of crying children?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWU2MTE1NmRmZTQ1NTRiNmQzMTE2ZmI0ZDQwNWJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjNjNTNhMDQxZjQ3ODY5NGEwZmI4NGZhOWNhNzJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena didn’t wait for an answer. “Come on,” she said to Amelia. “Wait outside,” she commanded the guard. “All of you.” She turned and pointed at the ground. “Stay.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmY2ZWQzN2EyYjRhZTJhYWQ5MmZiMWNiYjM5NDk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She stepped into the hallway, the floorboards creaking under her footsteps as she and Amelia were drawn to the sounds. They came to a door. Before entering, Serena closed her eyes for a moment, focusing on the aetherfield.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2FhNGFmZGI2ODQ3N2ZhZjk5ODlhZDY2Mzk5MDIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No threats.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDBlNWZlYjcwODRlZWFhMTkwMzAyMzhlZTQyNzZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She let her aura dip down to red, where she could keep it almost imperceptible to a normal person. Before she met Amelia, she might have burst into the room with orange or even yellow. Now, with her girlfriend’s layers upon layers of protective wards, she could be more conservative with her energy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzE3ZDQyNGZjMDQ5NTg5YzI3YzllMmIzZGNhY2M1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Amelia never seemed to run out of the stuff, did she?</span></p><span class="cmEzY2U2ZThiODQ3YTQyZjA4ZjEzYWFhMTk1NmQ2MTRl"><br/>Support the creativity of authors by visiting the original site for this novel and more.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM3NTJiYjcxYmViMjQ3MTRiZWE1ZjFmYTNjODg2ZjEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They stepped through the door just as something wooden and heavy was thrown against the far wall, accompanied by the screams and yelling of numerous children. The pieces of what might have been a chair fell to the floor, and with it, a sudden silence spread across the room as the inhabitants noticed her and Amelia’s presence. It was as if a symphony of destruction had just ended, the performers waiting for her to clap.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTMzYmRjNDI5ZjQxM2NhNjBhMjUxOGU4YmZiMjQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t feel like clapping.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWNjMDQxZDIyMjRlMmU5MmYzOWUyMGNmZDc3OTZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…” Amelia whispered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTMxMzYyNjM4NjRjMWJhMWEzYzYwNGU5MjZhNTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The state of the room was atrocious. Cabinets were torn from the walls. Furniture had been flipped and destroyed. It looked like a storm had passed. Half a dozen mattresses had been carved open, their contents spewing out. Blankets had been shredded, and bowls were smashed. What might have once been a beautiful dining table now lay broken in two pieces. Someone had taken an axe to it. Recently, judging by the debris around.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODY2NDI4MTc3YzRmNmY4NDg2ODk4YjllNzg4ZmVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The wood burner was the only redeeming feature. As Serena eyed it, she again noted the mattresses and remembered what Noburu had said about them only being able to heat one room of the house. Did they really live in this one room together?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWUwMGE2MWQ4ODRkYzJiZTY4NmMzZWQwMmUyYTRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Could demons live in such conditions? </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzUwMDgxN2IyNjRjMDg5ODBjMWU3OGZjZTUyNjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d seen shelters on the battlefield with more amenities than this!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTI3OWIzZDgwZjQwZGQ5NzcyMTNmMjk5OTQ3NjEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her attention to the room’s occupants, who were all staring at her and Amelia. In one rickety chair sat a young woman. Her features were instinctively recognisable. This would be Kiku, the one with a chronic illness. As if her thoughts were heard, Kiku coughed quietly, covering her mouth as if to hide the noise. Then she coughed again and again, and soon, the only sound breaking the silence was the noise of her hacking cough.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTM0MzA4NDYzZDRhYzU5NjdmMGEzNWY4ZWFjNzY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia took a step forward.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2U0ZDRhMjU5NTQxZDg5NjI0Zjg3M2JiNzQ5MTM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait,” Serena said. “Not in front of the guards.” Near Kiku stood one guard who was the one breaking things, judging by his sweat-lined forehead and reddened face. On the far side of the room, four children were lined up under the supervision of two more guards. They were all crying, their faces marked with welts. Had the guards struck them? Struck these </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">children!?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMxM2ZhMzhhYjQ1ZDQ3NDFhM2VjNjEyNjk4NjU3MmZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No, not guards. These were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thugs</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTQwMGE5N2E4MDQxMGRhOTgzYjY4YjdlNjk1ZTU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Noburu had been right. Of course, from the truth-telling crystal, Serena expected this to some extent, but a part of her had hoped his mind had exaggerated the corruption. Now, that hope withered away. From seeing the gang members openly assault people on their ‘territory’ to the attitude and discipline of the guards, to… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. He was right. They might be wearing the uniform, but these men were nothing but another gang.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWNmYmVhNzFmODQyNThiNzFjMjhiYzkxNmJiODE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it a result of a lack of aura-enhanced warriors to keep things in order? Her father always said demons worked best when they had superiors to obey and subordinates to command. Was this what society turned into when that system fell apart? Who was holding these men responsible?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjRmMDA1MDQxYTQ5MzY4NjExYmZlYTA5MWQyYmNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena walked further into the room, taking slow, methodical steps. The guards visibly tensed at her movement, their hands touching their sheathed swords. To them, she was a stranger, an unknown force. They must have realised she’d either fought her way past their colleagues or been let through.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDBmZjY4ZGQ1MTRhMzY4ZjY1Mjg2MDBiMzE1OGU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Identify yourself!” barked the red-faced man nearest to Serena. His demand sounded confident, but his posture and actions betrayed his unease. Serena ignored him, instead picking up a nearby cup of water and bending down on one knee in front of the coughing girl. She lifted her rainhat so the poor girl could see her face clearly. “Here,” she said, trying to keep the anger out of her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTQyMzMyOTg0NjRkMjNhNTk3MzZiNmRiZWVmOTMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kiku took the water. It took a few attempts for her to drink it. She kept coughing into the cup, spluttering the water over herself. Eventually, she was able to drink, and her coughing calmed down.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGVmNWE0YjA1NTQ2NzViZmY2Y2JmZjRjN2E3YjBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said-” the red-faced man angrily began. His face contorted in an ugly fashion as he realised he was being ignored.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzNiYzYzYjBlMTQ5MzNhMjNiN2IzY2M0ZWM2NjY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quiet,” Serena whispered. “I’ll deal with you in a moment.” She turned her head, looking at Amelia and then nodding towards the room’s exit. Amelia understood the intention and shuffled her way into the door, blocking any hope of exit. Not that the men in this building could escape from either of them, even if they gave them a hefty headstart. It was merely to prevent the idea from forming in their heads in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGUxY2I1ODhmYzRmZDA4MmNkNzRlMjllNTY2NjAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning her attention to the recovering girl, she asked, “I take it your name is Kiku?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTE0YTU3MTY3YzRiN2M5N2FhMjliYWFkMjc1OWUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Yes.” Kiku’s eyes were no longer full of the fear Serena had seen when she entered the room. Now they were full of worry. Good. That was an improvement. “How do you know?” she whispered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzRjNjRlNjU3YTRiZjk4YzdlM2UyMTk4NzYzODM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noburu told us all about you. He-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTA1ZjQyOWQ2ZDQyYTc5MjVlZDNhOGEyYWUxOGY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noburu is a good man!” Kiku suddenly blurted out. “I swear on the moons! He wouldn’t harm anybody! He’s only ever looked out for us! Please don’t take his hands! We’ll starve without…” The girl trailed off as another cough formed in her throat, forcing her to drink more water.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTE0MTI4YWE3YjQ4ZTdhNTM2YzQzNDQ1ODA5ZDRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know,” Serena said. “No one will be starving; you have my word on that.” If Kiku hadn’t been so frail-looking or if she had insulted Serena, then she likely wouldn’t have spoken so softly. Instead, she would chastise the girl over her ridiculous idea that a career criminal and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thief </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">could be considered a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">good man</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTE4NzU4NzVhMDRkMGY5OTJlZTJlNjU4NTJlZGYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But, given the situation, she couldn’t bring herself to educate Noburu’s younger sister.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmE4ZmJmOTdiZTQxNGU5Mzg3NmIzZGJkN2YxMTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They really had nothing. How could they bear to live like this? Their clothing was threadbare, and the mattresses and blankets that might have offered sufficient warmth in the winter were now destroyed by the very guards who were duty-bound to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">protect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> them. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDY5Y2EwMzkyMjQ1ZTdhOTEzNDU2OWY4ODNlZDA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The children,” Serena intoned, standing up and pointing towards the four young demons lined up. Under her finger, they tensed, so she quickly put her hand down. “There are four. I was told Kiku and her brother were looking after </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">six</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Where are the remainder?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTA5OWQyYjhkMzQ4NzNhMjRlNGQ3N2NmYmU5Yjkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...They ran,” one of the guards eventually said. Of the three guards in this room, this was the only one who had removed his hand from his sword. Had he realised who she was? Had he seen a glimpse of her military uniform underneath the raincoat? Maybe he realised it from her eye colour. If he was smart he might have realised from her boots. “Scampered over the wall when we broke, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ahem-</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” he coughed into his hand. “When we came inside.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjNhZGMxYjE4NjRlMDlhMmJhYzcwZWI1ZjEzNjYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so,” Serena answered, narrowing her eyes and glaring at the man. He struggled to meet her gaze. “And who might you be?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTZhMDcxMzMxMDQ2NzNiZWI0N2E0MmJlNDYxY2Zi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Keishi Nagata,” he answered. “Twenty-first guard squad under Captain Koyama.” He hesitated before sheepishly adding, “Ma’am.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGU0YWM4NmQ2ZjRiM2JhMDY1NTdkNzAwMTMyZDU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you?” she turned her gaze to the other guard in the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMThiMTA5ZjJlNzQxM2JhNzY4NTMwMTc3MDBmMjhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Ikki,” he eventually replied, casting looks between her and the red-faced guard. “Twenty-first guard squad under Captain Koyama.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDQzNmU4YmUwMDQ4OGZiOWRhODZlNDQxYTJlMWQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Family name?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODUyNTEzOTg1MjQ4Y2JhOGZiZmUzNWE5MWY1MmUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just Ikki.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2NlODg1N2Y3YjQ5MjBhMjllOThmNzIyY2YzMzg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDUwMTRkMTUxZTQ0MWQ4ZjE1MDM2MmU0OGE0MGNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She slowly turned her attention to the remaining red-faced guard. She stared at him for a while, well aware the more she stared, the more uncomfortable he would become. At first, he tried to glare back, but her long-practised, battlefield-hardened gaze would never lose to a mere thug dressed in a guard uniform. The man broke eye contact after a dozen seconds, glancing at his colleagues. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, Serena interrupted.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGY3OGFlY2MxMDQ4ODA5NmVhYWE1MmQzMWI0ZjE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And who are you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmFiMjIxNTUyNDQ4MmNhYTE2NDkyNDM2NTQ2NDhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The man took a deep breath as if trying to fill his body with confidence. “Yasuji Obara!” he half-shouted. “Squad leader of-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjVlZDE1OWY0OTQ0ZDJiYzVmNjg4ZWIzYzY0MDk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One moment,” Serena raised her hand, cutting him off. She looked towards the guards Keishi and Ikki. “You two, move over there.” She pointed to a space near the recently-broken dining table.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTlmMjYwNjM5MjRiY2Y5MTY0Y2E3ODJiYjJjNzdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Why?” Keishi asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDhjNzJkMWVjYjRhMWFiYmEwYTQyMGY3OGJmYTE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re scaring the children.” Serena clicked her tongue. “So move.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTI5ZjA0NGU1ODRmYTc4NDJkYWUwOGU0MmRlYzI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDRiYzEzMWRmZDQyNmY5ODI0ZjE2OTk1ZmY4MWFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two guards shuffled over, casting glances in her direction. She was about to bark at them to run but didn’t want to shout for fear of troubling the children further.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzJmNmUzMWNiZDQ5YTZhOWYwY2EzODJlZTYwN2Jh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They’d been exposed to enough noise already.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDI5MWY4MGY4MTRjNzU4NTllOWM5NmUyZGIyMjM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, where were we,” she raised an eyebrow at the remaining guard. “Squad leader of…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODc2YWIzMzU2ZjQyZmQ4ODFlNGIzNTQ4ZDcxZjFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Squad leader of the twenty-first guard squad!” He snapped, his face slowly becoming a better and better impression of the red moon. “Under Captain Koyama! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, will you explain who you are and what you’re doing!? This building is under my control!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Spittle flew from the man's mouth as he struggled to keep his anger under control.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2IxOWZjNjU5MzQwMjJiZmVhNTM0YmQxODBlZDU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She shook her head. Who was he to make demands of her?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2UyNWQxNTI5NzRkODQ5ZmRiMTViOWQ3MzBhMjQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Amelia piped up from the door, “Another man arrived! He’s talking to the outside guards. They’re calling him Captain Koyama!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGQwZjhiMTdlMDRlMWY4MmE5MGI2NzdiOTJmODcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?” Serena smiled. Chesterfield obviously wanted them to do things discreetly, but with the corruption this deep, there would be a certain amount of blowback. Or maybe… Chesterfield </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> seen the truth-teller react to Noburu’s statements. He probably realised it was truly this bad, which meant if they caused a scene, it was likely something anticipated or perhaps even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">desired</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTEwZGViODc0ZTRiNTg4Yjg2MmYxOTM0NzcyYzM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tsk! He wasn’t using them both for some means unseen, was he?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjhkZDI2YjNmNDQ1MWU5ZDE0YWI3MjEzZTA1ZTdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go outside,” Serena said to Amelia, “Inform </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Captain </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Koyama and any men he has with him that you are exercising your privilege and rights as a Speaker </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a Lord-Prospect. Inform him you are detaining him and his men, and they are not to move from their location until instructed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2JiMmQ4MjljYzQ2YWE4MTc1M2FmOWU1MmVmMTVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh! Okay!” Amelia's eyes widened. “Will he… obey me?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzBlZmU2YjA5YjRlNzViNTQ3NjI5MzY1NTgyY2Ri" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably not,” Serena admitted. “But he has no right of refusal. Use whatever means you want to make him comply.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2FhYzNlZjM3NzQ4YWRhMzcxYWJjNTMzMDQ3ZGY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right!” Amelia nodded, punching her open hand with the other. Her face was deadly serious. “I’ll be right back!” She turned and began to move out before swivelling around and asking. “And then, I can… you know?” She gestured to Kiku and the children.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTJlMzk3ZTM0ODQ3YWNiMDlhNWFmZGQwMGQ2NzVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.” Serena smiled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTlmYTgzM2Y5MDRmZDhhYjIwMmEyOWY0ZGNmZjkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm! I’ll be a minute!” Amelia vanished, only to return a moment later. “Uh, do I need to inform them of their charges?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzk2Y2IyNjIxNzRhMjI5M2RmMTIxN2M5NzIwYzRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about that,” Serena replied, glancing towards the guards. “You’re only detaining them. Charges will come later.” At her words, the guards’ jaws clenched.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzVhZjA1NjEwYjQ3NWU4YjIyYjc4NjY0Y2E1ZmYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood!” Amelia gave a quick bow and vanished once more. While keeping her perception open to Amelia’s outside antics, Serena snapped her head towards the guard called Yasuji.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGI2MmNhMTQwYTRkZGQ4NDYxOTgxZmJmMTIwN2Uz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait a minute, wasn’t Yasuji the one Noburu was worried about harming Kiku?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDYxY2I5MTdiZDRjYzZhZGM1ZTA2OTVlOGQ4ZGM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Had Serena arrived just in time?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGMwNWI4MTg4MzQ2ZDBiNmE3NzI4ODY2N2UzYjU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She eyed Yasuji. “This… destruction,” she waved her hand around, gesturing to the destroyed furniture. “Your doing, I presume? Why have you destroyed what little these people have? They clearly have no valuables.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODczODg0ZWY4YjQ2MGJiNDdiMjQ2MDBkMGFjZGE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-they are thieves!” Yasuji spluttered, his attitude suddenly changing after hearing Amelia be referred to as both a Speaker </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a Lord-Prospect. What would he be thinking? Perhaps he was wondering who Serena was to be able to command Amelia to go and detain his captain.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTAzMjY3NTkzODRhZjFiM2YwNTgxYTlhODQyNmYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thieves?” Serena asked, raising an eyebrow. “What thieving do you think this girl can do? She can barely walk, isn’t that right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWEzM2Q2MTA0MTQ0NTI4NzIwYTdhMGYwMzFmYjA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I mean, look at this!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzJlNmIyODNjYzQyMWNiMjMxMzQ1MzU4MTQ1NzEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s attention was directed to a winter coat the occupants had apparently stashed away. It was the kind of cloak you could find anywhere in the city shops if you were on a budget. Yasuji tried to argue this was stolen, but Serena was having none of it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTM1MTU1YjYzNjQ3NTliY2M0YzA0NzYwMzY1OTg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s her brother!” Yasuji hastily changed his approach. “You’ve interrogated him, right? Then you know what kind of man he is! It’s not just him!” He cast a finger towards the four children. “They’re fingersmiths! They’ll slip a purse from your person the moment you look away! They-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjhlYWRiMmE1YTRjYjA5Njk3N2NmMmFlZGViNDI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A flurry of protests erupted from the children.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjA2N2Y5NThkNTQwOGE4ZGMzY2YxOTkyMDgxYzUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Liar!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWJlMmMyNDdiMTQxNmFhYWZhZWVkNDA3NmNhNWVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You steal from us!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDJkNjc0YWE0ZDQ0MDY4MTgxOTFhNTI2MTg3ZWZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell her, Kiku!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmZlNjMxY2EzZDRmNjc4MjJiZGY4YWM5ODk0MTU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s.. it’s true!” Kiku exclaimed. “We pay him money for protection, but he always asks for more and more! He always threatened to turn this place over and take anything of value, and that’s what he was doing! He’s destroyed everything! He said if Noburu didn’t return, he would take me to bed and-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDBiMmI1NjQyMDRjMTI5OWVkNjVkN2JhMDI4OTlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stupid girl!” Rage blossomed again in Yasuji’s face, spittle flying everywhere. He stepped forward, raising his hand to strike her. Serena’s eyes widened. What was he trying to do!? Knock her head off!?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWUwNmRhNTkyZDQwNzI5ZmRlMThiYmZhOGQ3ZjQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena manifested her aura, blossoming it into a bright orange.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGY0MDQzMDA4ZTQyNjZiMzFlYjZhNmM4NzUyY2Uw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was more than enough to intercept the strike with her hand, snapping Yasuji’s arm before he realised she’d even moved. It wasn’t a clean break, either. Letting her subdued anger come forth, she crushed his bones as she snapped them. He would never use that arm again. He’d probably need it amputated.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWM1ZDRmMzQ0NDRmMzhhNWMyYWI4MTA0OWMyYTEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless Amelia healed him, which she sincerely hoped she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wouldn’t</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDJiMjg3NjFkMjRiNThiYjc3YTdiOTA1YzdlZWRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She kicked Yasuji across the room, where he collided with the broken dining table, collapsing into a heap next to his stunned colleagues. Amazingly, he wasn’t unconscious. Instead, he threw up before clutching his arm with a face of agony.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2RiNWM2MjYxYjQ5MTJhYTU3Mzc3ZTA3ZWZjYWFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… ah…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjM5N2QxMDA3YjQyNzZiOWU1NTNjMzdkNjAzYjY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you scream, I’ll break the other one.” Serena walked over to him and then spat on him. It was an action she’d only done a few times in her life and one she’d never do in proper company, reserved only for when she wanted to establish her utter distaste for someone. “You two,” she glared at Keishi and Ikki, their faces white. “Take him outside. Under my authority and rights granted to me by Imperial Law, I, Lord Halen, am detaining the three of you.” She raised her voice slightly. “Amelia, I’m coming out!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjZjNzI4NmZiOTQ2NWE4OGRjNDlhY2ZmOGFmZThi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard! I’m almost done!” came the reply, easily picked up by Serena’s enhanced perception.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTg0ZDQ3MjQ4NDQ3Y2E4N2Y5OTE3NmNlNGExNTk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena removed her rainhat and coat, revealing the immaculate black and gold officer uniform underneath. She wasn’t sure how, but when the guards saw the uniform, even more blood drained from their faces. Yasuji had gone from being as red as the red moon to as white as the white one. Even the children couldn’t resist uttering their surprise.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODAwMTRkYWE1OTRiOWRhMTQ5ZGUyYTc3MGFhOTVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoa…!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGUxNmE0MTIyYzQ0MTg4YjY5N2YxMDA5OTBiYjFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s glowing orange!</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTYyNGRkYjFkZDQzMjM5MjRhODdlOWVkZDgwYzBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s aura, Reo! Remember I told you about it!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2M3ZWRhY2QwOTRlM2Y5YTgwNGQ2YTkzZTM1NGUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So pretty!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWE1ZGM1OTFkMzQzNGRhMTJiNTBhYTkwNzVmZDll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She led the men outside to find Amelia dragging an unconscious body into a line of a dozen others. It looked like they’d tried to resist Amelia’s detention, but her magic had put them to sleep before they could achieve anything.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2RhYzM5MmJmMDRlYTE4YjIxMjIzMjgwNzYxOWNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello!” she chirped. “That one’s the Captain,” she said, pointing towards one of the sleeping demons. “Those are the two that came with us, that one is the guard who was at the door, and… the rest are men the Captain brought with him!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTUyOWQwMDg3NjQxOTViOGQ4N2I4ZjU4ZTFhMDJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quite the collection,” Serena nodded, turning towards the three guards. “Sit down,” she ordered. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzJmOWZkZmY1YzQ0OTFiZDVhYzc5NTIzNDNmN2Ux" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They hastily obeyed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGEyYWU4ZDMzZTQ5ODdhN2UwN2IwOTQzZGEzMWM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mind adding these three to your collection?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWRiMDgwMTY3YTRmMzU4MDk3YWMxNTlkZDAyZWYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, mmm!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmM0ZTM3OGUxMjQyMTY5OGFhZWI5MThmODAzNWI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia put the three men to sleep and then warded the area so no one could interfere. They returned to the destroyed room to find the four children crowded around Kiku, fussing over her. They backed off a little when they entered, their eyes wary.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTRiYzBmMzJjMTQ0YjVhMWJkMzg1MzQ4ZWE5ZGY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But not hostile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTA2ODJhMGM4MTQ0ZDM4YmZmZWIxODdkYTdhNzk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena didn’t have time to say anything before Amelia pushed past her, practically falling to Kiku’s side as she grabbed the demon's hands and spluttered, “Hello! I’m Amelia! It’s nice to meet you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDhiNmEwYTI4YTQ0OWY5NzA0MWFkZDI4YmI4ZWNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s…” Kiku looked confused. “Nice to meet you, but…” she pulled her hands away. “I’m so dirty, and I don’t want to make you unwell, umm, Lord-Prospect…? Are you crying?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzQ4ZGE2NzNjMDRlOWFiMGY2Njk3MzcyNzAxOWIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!” Amelia replied as tears bubbled up and fell down her cheek. “Never mind that, I can’t get ill anyway! How long have you had your condition?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzBjYjA4NjdiYTQ0YWE4YzI0ODRjNzlhNjE5N2Rh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Almost… four years, Lord-Prospect,” Kiku smiled weakly. “I don’t know what it is, but I can’t walk very far, so I stay in this room.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWQxYWNkYWZkYzRjMDk5N2JlMDkwZDM3MTMyMTJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Four… four years?” Amelia echoed. She wiped her tears and, in the process, knocked her hat off, revealing her golden hair that seemed to shine in the drab and dreary room. No, her hair was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">actually</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> shining. Amelia was spooling her magic up. “I used to be ill for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so long</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as well. I couldn’t move at all some days, and I cried </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so many </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">tears at how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">unfair</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it was! I can see you’re a beautiful demon with a beautiful soul…” Amelia sniffed. “It’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not fair</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> this happened to you!” Amelia sniffed again as more tears were pouring from her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTJkZmNjNzU0NzQ0Y2U5MWE2YmYwNjcyODMzMmFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kiku started crying, yet she was also smiling. She gave a weak laugh and thanked Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTI3MDM4MDdhYTRhZGNiYWQ1ODY3YTZkYTM1MDk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tsk! Even Serena felt something in her eyes. She turned away to dab her face discreetly. As she did, she heard the children squeal in excitement.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmRjNDBhYWJlNDRhZDY4NjliNzk2Y2Y0ZDU2Yjlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s shining!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Mjc0ZDc4OTJkNjQxZWFiN2MwZDlhMjcyM2FiNzlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it aura!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzQ0YTM4Mjc0NDQ5N2VhMzAzYWEyNWZhNjllM2E0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She doesn’t have horns!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmNlYzUxNzUxNTRhMzdhMDc1ZWJiZWZiZTQ2ZTdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“K-kiku! It’s the human healer I told you about! It is, isn’t it!? She’s come for you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTRjYTQ4ZGQ0ZjQwZjdhMmIzZGEwYjA0MDAyYWMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” Amelia blubbered. “I’m that healer, and I’m going to make you all better!” She reached forward and pulled Kiku into a hug. “I’m going to make everyone better! Can I do that for you, Kiku? Please?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzBkNzQyNDM5MDRkYjhiMGZhNmJmZWE3NWMzNWU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">From over Amelia’s shoulder, tears flowed freely down Kiku’s face. “Yes,” she croaked, her voice weak. “Please fix me. I want-” She choked up with emotion, unable to continue.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzdhOTg0YTkwYTQ4YmQ4YTNmNDdjNTFlYmY5YzY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia just kept crying, and as she did, she glowed even more. The room was filled with golden light. The children cheered and threw themselves into the hug, wrapping their arms around both Kiku and Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTlhMjFiNWJjODRlNzViNmMzYmJhMmRmM2JkN2M2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait a minute…</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTc2NGM5YjE2YTRkZDE5MGVkYzdhNDM5ZTEzNDc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">How much aether was she cycling right now!?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDk3ZDFmOWQyODQzNWU4NThkYTZjN2I0YTNhMjg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena thought Kiku was being healed, but Amelia hadn’t activated the spell yet! All this glowing was just from her spell formation! How much aether was she putting into it!?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWQ4OTM4MmRkYTRkY2U4MDk3NzFmNjRkMDBjNzM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia!” Serena called. “Discreetly, remember!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTdkNjI2OWZmMzRmODFiNzRkODg0ZDBiYjIyM2Nm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I can’t do this discreetly!” Amelia cried out. “And I don’t want to! I can’t stop it!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjE5ZmM0NTRiZDQ2NDdiNzgxOTQxN2JhNzNjMmIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena hurried into a position where she could see Amelia’s face better. “No, really!” she stressed. “Keep it down! Think of the problems this might cause!” She could tell already this was going to be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">at least </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">a magnitude more powerful than the healing Amelia cast when she covered the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">entirety </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGJmMTFjZjlmMDRhZTViNjU1NDZiOGUwYWE0OTc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll fix those problems as well!” Amelia cried, sniffing heavily. She opened her eyes. Gone were her crimson irises, instead they shone a bright golden blue, with raw aether misting off them. It was as if she’d Spoken a Word!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDIwYjNkY2IxMDQ1Y2FiMWMyYmU1NGRmNDdlMzli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Third-circle,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Amelia spoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWJjZmNiMzg5MDQ3YzJiMTQ0MTg3YmNlZTU3MmQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena sent a quick prayer to the Empress.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDVkNmE3ZjRmMTQ5NTA4YjVhZWEwYTNkMGMyMDhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Divine Healing of Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTQxMzk5NGM0YjRlZmI4NWVjNTc2OGQ1M2RjYzUy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Amelia’s magic activated.</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Sixty-Eight: Made In The Empress's Image</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNhMmFkNmQ2MGFkNjRhMWI4NGY4OGZjMTYyOWY0ZDA5"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjFhYWZmMjU4MzQyZmViZTM1ZTcxMjM4MTZhYzE5">Amelia activated her magic.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjcyNjYwMzk0OTRmYzc4NjdhNzY1YzU4NjQ2OWYw">Passion, kindness, and love <em>erupted</em> from her. Using so much power caused her to experience an exhilarating release as her aether burned away the slums' unhappiness and sorrow. Her magic was a bubble of hope expanding outwards, fending off this place's oppressive darkness. The atmosphere hummed with her aether, somehow sounding <em>happy</em>. It was as if the world itself was satisfied with the meal of aether Amelia had cooked up.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDU1YWFlMWFiYzQwNjY4ZjA0Nzc2NDNjZDRiYjhk">Tears continued to stream down her cheeks as she squeezed Kiku. She could feel the young girl’s body mending under her loving light. Her frail body was strengthening, and so were the bodies of the poor, skinny children who were hugging the pair of them.</p>
<p class="cnM4MWY4OWUzYzE2ZjQ1MGY5ZDhhNmRiM2I3NWIyN2Fi">From the height of her spell’s intensity, it took time for things to calm down. Her healing magic diffused slowly throughout the atmosphere, like a lingering musical note fading into silence. Amelia had cast a magical symphony, and her expectations of a thunderous applause were not disappointed as she pulled away from Kiku. However, instead of an audience of Eastern Lords, she had a gaggle of agitated children.</p>
<p class="cnM5OWNiNWY3MTU2YjRlY2I4NWQ5NTNiODJjMTQ5MTQx">“That was amazing!”</p>
<p class="cnM1YmMyZjBkYTRlMDRkZDY5N2Y0M2RjOWY0YWE3OTdm">“I don’t feel hungry anymore!”</p>
<p class="cnNiOGZiODU5YzdiMTQzZjQ4OGY5MWZhM2Y1MmQwNGUz">“Look! My scars have gone!”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjM3ZDI3NjM3NjRhNjM5ZDg0YjU4Yjc0NWJlNzE1">“Kiku! Kiku! How do you feel!?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjVlMzc2OTUyNTRjYzhiYWM2ZTBhYzhlYjQ3ODIy">“Give her space!” Amelia waved the excited children back. She stood up, wiping tears of happiness from her face. She held a hand out to Kiku. Only then did she see that Kiku, the chair she sat on, and the rest of the room were spotless! She must have somehow integrated her cleaning magic into <em>Divine Healing of Aseco’s</em> formation! How? It must have been instinctual, right? All she did was pour all her emotion into her aether and let it do its thing!</p>
<p class="cnM2YjUxMTdhZThmMTRmYmJhOGQ5ZmRmOTRlNDkyMzI2">This wasn’t a problem, was it?</p>
<p class="cnNlZTA3YmFmNTA1NDRlYTc5ODQwYjFiZWRkNzZiZGE1">Kiku took her hand and stood up. With a nervous smile, the girl took one step. Then another. Then another. Kiku paced the length of the room once, then twice, and then, while laughing happily, skipped and jumped into the air. “I don’t feel any exhaustion!” Kiku exclaimed, spreading her arms wide. It was as if she were announcing her cured condition to the world. “It’s… it’s…” Kiku ran and embraced Amelia. “Thank you, oh thank you. Amelia! No! Saint Amelia! You’re a Saint! You’ve healed me! Oh, may the moons bless you!”</p>
<p class="cnMwOTcyMDA3NDMyZjRlYjQ5YmZhNTg4YjI4NzI4MDJj">“You’re welcome!” Amelia hugged her back. She was <em>so</em> happy to see she could change someone's life like this! <em>This</em> was what she should be doing more of! If she knew how bad this place was, she would have been more forceful about the matter with Greatlord Oshiro! She would have just done it! It was wrong to have such potential and power to help so many people and <em>not</em> use it… right?</p>
<p class="cnM3MTNhNzhhYzQ5MjQxNzlhMzE5NTdmZjNmZDhmZGNj">“Even the room…” Amelia heard Serena mutter.</p>
<p class="cnM3Yjc0NTMwZGM1ZDQ5ZWE5NjQzMGZjNGQzMzZkMGY4">Amelia broke away from Kiku for a second time. The moment she did, the children threw themselves at the girl. Poking and prodding both their bodies and hers, asking her for the tenth time if she still felt strong.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzYwZjQ4ZDRhYjQ1YzM5N2YxYzJjYjQyZTMyMjFm">“He must have expected this, don’t you think?” Amelia bounced up to Serena, grinning wildly. “How can he not have!? He knows what I’m like!”</p>
<p class="cnM4NWFmZjE3MzAyNTQ4ZWQ4YzU1ZDBlOGM5ODczNjY3">“Sure…” Serena shook her head. “But this… powerful? He must have-”</p>
<p class="cnNjOGQ2NjNlMGI1MjRlOGU5ZDFhNzc4NTJhMjAzNDQ2">Serena was cut short by the sound of an air siren. Its long, droning undulations filled the air, causing even the celebrating children to pause.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTU1Y2RmYzQ4MTQ5ODg4NTk4ZTkyNDBjMDg4OTZk">“That’s the response to… <em>you</em>,” Serena sighed. “I would say I was getting a headache but you just healed it away! <em>Tsk</em>!” Her girlfriend clicked her tongue but obviously wasn’t annoyed as she ruffled Amelia’s hair.</p>
<p class="cnMxODMwNzljOTRlZTQ5ZTk4NjJmNjA1N2Y0OTViY2Fh">“Hey!” Amelia protested. Still smiling, she began to fix her hair while looking around. Perhaps someone would come, just like how the Greatlord of Kenhoro appeared after their fight in the city? Greatlord Oshiro wouldn’t be mad at her, would he? Amelia stretched her senses, even looking into the Shimmer; the lingering atmospheric aether made it surprisingly easy for her. When she looked around, she jumped.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTc3MmU0MTA3MjQ2NTViMDMxYzhhYTVjMjNiNzhk">There, in the doorway, was the <em>scary-but-not-actually-scary</em> Lord Guardian!</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjlkNjg4NjNlNTQ1YjVhNDY0M2M2NTNhYjRjNzYw">Her mint tea-loving friend!</p>
<p class="cnMxMzZmOTgzYTIzNjQyNjI4NjcyNjZkNTY5MzM5NmNm">He was standing in the Shimmer, invisible to Serena and the others. He said something to her, but she couldn’t hear it. She shrugged, and he then pointed to her and Serena, gesturing to the hallway. His movements were strange, as if he were experiencing a faster flow of time. Chesterfield mentioned a time difference, hadn’t he? What was it he said? A minute in the Shimmer was thirty seconds outside. Did that mean, to the Lord Guardian, he was seeing her move in slow motion?</p>
<p class="cnMxNGU5OTllMzYyZjRkMDY5YjVjOGFmYmFjM2Y2ZDkw">“He’s waiting for us!” Amelia chirped, pulling Serena’s arm.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTA1YmNiZDFlNjQ5MGY5OTMwNjJiN2FiYjk2ODFh">“Who?”</p>
<p class="cnNiODZhZDBlYjY2ZjRlMTNiY2Q3YjllMmYwZTIyNjll">“The Lord Guardian!”</p>
<p class="cnM5NmIxNjkzYjk1NjRiZDE4M2I4OWUwMDExMDZlOTUw">At her words, Serena’s eyes widened. Honestly, he wasn’t that scary! Couldn’t they sense his good heart and caring spirit? She knew etiquette was important to the Eastern Lords, but sometimes they should lighten up a little! How many friendships were they missing out on because of the boundaries they enforced between themselves!?</p>
<p class="cnM0OWY2YzAyZDZhYjQ2OWE4ZjY2NGZiYTFjNzFkMzM0">Amelia led Serena to the hallway, shutting the door behind her. As she did, the Lord Guardian appeared from within the Shimmer before them, his figure dominating the hallway with his horns barely missing the ceiling. </p>
<p class="cnM3ZDlhYzJhZWNlOTRjYTA4YzNiYzI0YTRkOGFmNmJm">Serena immediately fell to one knee. “My will is your will,” she uttered quickly.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGIzZWQzZjQyOTRmN2ZhNmRjNTViMThhZjhkNzhm">Amelia followed suit. The action felt overly submissive to her, but she couldn’t ignore how powerful the Lord Guardian was, so some level of respect was warranted. She still couldn’t see souls that clearly; they were murky, and their outlines faint and, well, <em>shimmering</em>. However, the Lord Guardian’s soul shone larger and brighter than Lunaria’s! </p>
<p class="cnM3MWQyOTNmMWZjYjQxZDU4YzQ1YTMyMzc5MDI0Mzgx">This man was undoubtedly a Speaker of at least one Second-Word.</p>
<p class="cnMxODAzOWUxYTc3YzRiY2E5NzY4ZjFhMmQzYzI5N2Rk">The Empress must have tremendous power to command a group of these <em>Lord Guardians</em>! She thought there must be limitations on their actions because the war would surely have ended long ago if they’d been mobilised.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTYxNDJkN2FkNzQ5ZjM5OTEyMmRiOGU2MzY1YjI3">“Lords, rise,” the Lord Guardian spoke, his voice low and clear. They both straightened. As Amelia examined the Lord Guardian further, she noticed his scarred face was… still scarred. Was he out of range when she cast her healing spell? Or did her magic not work well enough in the Shimmer? Perhaps he avoided it somehow. If Amelia’s hidden theory was correct, then he chose to keep his scars. Maybe he was proud of them? Possibly he saw them in a similar manner to how Serena saw her bronze eagle - a physical symbol of their achievements and record of their duties.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjJmODlhNGQ2ZjQ3YTFhY2IyNmJlODMxZjQxN2Nj">Amelia also noticed a faint smell of blood lingering on the demon. It wasn’t there before. Had he been fighting someone recently? In between the time of their last meeting and this one? Who had he fought with, and why?</p>
<p class="cnNiMzI4MWFmMmFhNTQ2YWJhZWUyNzUwOTFkY2ZlOTVh">“I thought you said you were returning to your original duties,” Amelia blurted out before hastily adding, “Lord Guardian” as Serena tensed beside her. Oops, was she supposed to wait for him to talk first? She was, wasn’t she? The Lord Guardian frowned but thankfully didn’t seem angry.</p>
<p class="cnNhN2EwZjJhMDljNzQ5YTNhMzFjNzc5NjA4MzI4Y2Mz">“I did. Now, your <em>antics</em> are my current duties.”</p>
<p class="cnM4Njk4MDA2NzY4NTQzZjc4Mzk2ZDU5OGZhNTRjYWI3">“Oh,” Amelia mumbled. “I’m not in trouble, am I? It’s really not my fault!” she protested. “It’s the fault of whoever let the slums become like this, you know!? Have you seen the condition of the people here? It’s terrible! That… <em>Noburu</em> was right! People are barely surviving! Everyone’s so thin! There’s no law and order! I-” She was cut off by the Lord Guardian raising a palm.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzllOWY1YjVmMjQ3Yzk4MjE3NDhmNzUzOTQwMGJm">He looked at her for a long moment, then looked to his left as if thinking. “Your personality…” he quietly said, as if talking to himself. “It’s as if…”  He was silent for a few more seconds before mumbling one more word.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWNmYWZkMjdiNDQ4MDE5ZGQ5YjM0ZTVkZDg2MzVm">“...Sisters…”</p>
<p class="cnM4YWY2MDFkZTA2YTQ2MWZhYTEwNDBiNDVhMDQ0MDBk">He suddenly shook his large head. “I’ve made a decision,” he said. “Return to the academy and continue as you have. Greatlord Oshiro is aware of your actions today. He will give you further guidance. Also…” he gestured with his head towards the front door. “Drop your spellwork on those outside. I will take them into custody. Understand?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ODRlNzIwOTQ2NDQyZThhNTQ1OWEyOTEzYTk1ZTA2">“Yes, Lord Guardian,” Serena intoned.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWM0NzdmYTU1NjQ5YzdhMThmNjM5YjNlNDRkMGMx">“Yes! Lord Guardian!” Amelia echoed, ending her <em>Kanaxai</em> sleeping spells. She knew she should take an attitude of deference to the Lord Guardian, but she couldn’t help but ask, “What about the children? I can’t-”</p>
<p class="cnNhZGViMGFlY2IyMTQ3NDNiMWM1ODU3ZTE0YzUzMzAw">“The children will be protected. An Imperial tracker will find the other two. Do not worry your troubled heart, Lord-Prospect Thornheart.” The man’s piercing gaze lingered on Amelia. It wasn’t a look of friendliness like she would experience from Tomes or Dagon, but it also wasn’t the harsh, imposing stare of hostile intimidation. “Did you observe closely before?” he suddenly asked. “You won’t be able to use that man’s method. His blessing allows him to access the Shimmer in an alternative way. You should aim to copy me instead.”</p>
<p class="cnNjZTY5NjgzOTNiNDRiNjM5OGJiZTJiZWMxMGFiOWM2">Amelia blinked. “Umm, I looked, but I still don’t understand exactly what I’m looking for!” She had <em>tried</em> to see how the Lord Guardian moved into the Shimmer, and she expected an ‘ah ha!’ moment after observing him, but she struggled to find anything obvious!</p>
<p class="cnM1MWMzMDUwODJjMTQ0MGZhYmM3ZmZmODgxYzRjYjFl">“Hmm…” He thought for a moment. “Focus on your shadow.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NDRjOGQ5NWFhYTQwZWM4NTcwMzZlYzg5NTIzMDQx">“M-my shadow?” Amelia spluttered. Of all the advice she thought she might get, that was leagues away from what she thought it could be! What did her shadow have to do with anything!?</p>
<p class="cnNiMjA3YTgxMTRjMDQwZTRhZTFmZjhkMzM1NTFhNGRm">“Yes,” the Lord Guardian nodded with a definite finality. “Now,” he continued, moving to the side as much as he could within the confines of the corridor. “Go,” he commanded.</p>
<p class="cnNjMmFmOGNkYzliMzRmY2ViMWQxMDU4YjUyMzg4YzU5">“Yes, Lord Guardian,” Serena said firmly, pulling Amelia towards the door. “Your will is my will.”</p>
<p class="cnNjZGE1ZmUyOTI3OTQwMzg4MDgzNjNjNTUyYWJmNzc3">“Your will is my will!” Amelia squeaked as she passed him. “Thanks for everything! Don’t scare the children!”</p>
<p class="cnNmMTA0Mjc4NzE3YjQyNWI4MTU1ZDAxYTYyYjk4ODg3">“...I will not,” came the growled reply as they exited the door.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjVjYWYwOTZiNTQ5MzBiNzE1NTZkMTcxMDg1NWM3">He definitely would! Ah, well, he was a kind soul; Amelia was sure of that! Kiku and the children might initially be scared, but they’d warm up to him! Right!?</p>
<p class="cnNmNjY0ZDIyNjY5MjQ0MTQ4NjhmOGRiMmI1YzIyNjFh">“Seven hells…” Serena muttered.</p>
<p class="cnNhZmUxYmViZmRhMTQ2YmM5OTdmMzNjN2Q4OWI3MTI4">Amelia turned to see what she was looking at. It wasn’t anything in particular. Instead, Serena was looking at… everything. Amelia saw why. The streets, everything from the roughly-hewn stone walls to the dirty and smoke-stained roofs to the very cobblestones they walked on, had been thoroughly <em>cleaned</em> by Amelia’s magic.</p><span class="cjkzMzA5NDE0MjU5YzRjODY4NDJkMTgzMzkzZDViYzc0"><br/>Unauthorized tale usage: if you spot this story on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlMjQzZDdhNjIxODRjMjg5NGNkNThkMDRkY2Q0Nzhi">It had clearly gone far further than just the boundaries of the orphanage.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2ZmMjgyNmI2ZjQ1MzZiMDEwNzdhZWQ5OWZkYmIz">They moved down the street, passing the unconscious guards laid out in a line. They would soon stir and no doubt be completely confused as to what had occurred while they were sleeping. Amelia saw that the guard whose arm Serena broke was now completely healed. Although she didn’t like thinking such thoughts, she couldn’t help but think that it was a shame. Amelia had heard what had gone on inside while dealing with the captain outside. How long had Kiku suffered in the presence and under the gaze of that lecherous and thuggish man? It was perhaps better for everyone if that man lost control of an arm.</p>
<p class="cnM0MmMwMjM1OGY0ODQ0YjZiNGIxNzVhNWU4OTEwZDAy">Although, her healing may set him on a better path. She would have to hope so.</p>
<p class="cnMxODA2ZjkxYmRjZjQ2ZDZiNGU2NzVhMDk5MTEzNzBi">As they moved down the street, people’s voices sounded from within their homes. Some were crying, some were cheering, and some were fearful or just in plain awe.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZGJlMzhkZGIxOTRlOGFhNDNiMGQyODA2YTg5ZTNk">“My knees! They work again!”</p>
<p class="cnMyZDFjMmRmMjFiODRjNjY4N2QxMjBkYzk5ZmJkNDY1">“My teeth no longer hurt!”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTBmZjRhMmQyNzRjZGY4YzY2ZDhmMzdmOWFjOWNm">“Oh, my daughter! Your fever’s gone!”</p>
<p class="cnNiMDBiOWY4NTM2YjQ0NTZiY2FlZDRmNzNlM2ZhMWY4">“The Dust… I don’t feel the shakes anymore!”</p>
<p class="cnMzMjdhYjFlZjQwMTRhZmY4ZDI4NTVmYzk0NjU2Nzdi">Soon, people started to pour into the streets. It was amazing to see how many people actually lived in the slums, considering how empty the streets were before! They exited their homes to check if their neighbours had experienced the same miracle. They shared their stories, and for the first time since Amelia entered the slums…</p>
<p class="cnMwMjZiYjg1YzgxYTQ2ZGQ5YjA3OTMwNGY4Yzc4NWFl">They were all smiling.</p>
<p class="cnMwNDA3MmIxZDJiODQzY2JhMjlmYWIzZjg2YWMxMGJj">Their jubilant cheers and celebrations were backed by the air siren above. The slum’s residents didn’t seem to mind; instead, they focused on hugging their neighbours and looking around in awe. Many were running their fingers across the walls and floor, exclaiming in amazement at how clean everything was. Some cheered, claiming the event as the work of the Empress or a blessing of the Blue Moon. Whatever it was, they were too occupied to pay too much attention to Serena and Amelia hurrying past.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjBhNjVmMTRiODQ1Y2I4MTA2YTRhYmIwYTc5ZmQ5">A minute later, the air siren stopped.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzYyMWM4MjM1ZDQ4NDJiNTAzMDBhNzYwOTU3Nzky">“Thank the Empress for that,” Serena said. “Chesterfield or someone else must have spread the word they didn’t need to scramble the reserve fleet. I was worried this was going to be another situation like the <em>Sakamoto</em>. Hopefully, you won’t be charged or fined for this.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YTgyMmJhOTdhNTQ0ODA4OGY2OTZjNzlhMTgwZmM5">“Mmm, hopefully!” Amelia chirped. How could they <em>fine </em>her for doing so much <em>good</em>!? What she had done wasn’t what she had been warned against. She hadn’t given the lords of Asamaywa preferential treatment. No, she healed the people who needed it most! Other than herself and Serena, she doubted a single member of the nobility was within range!</p>
<p class="cnM0YzhjYTExY2NkZDRjMjBhOTczYTUyNGVmODQ4MzZi">They entered the square with the defunct fountain. Half an hour ago, it was nothing but a grimy, run-down area with a few ramshackle stalls. Now everything was clean and shiny, and hundreds of spotless demons walked about in wonder, hugging and cheering. Someone had brought out barrels of ale, and they were handing out drinks to anyone who wanted them. Even the children were getting small mugs, their formerly gaunt faces now fuller and painted with broad smiles!</p>
<p class="cnM3MWNjNTBjYzljNzQ0ZGY5N2RjOTEzMzJlOTU2YzAy">They were able to navigate through the square without much incident, although a few demons seemed to notice her golden hair and Serena’s military uniform. They began following them, and Amelia could hear their mutterings about a ‘highborn human’ and the ‘golden healer’. She started to worry she might pull too much attention, but Serena managed to make them scatter with a few well-placed glares.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2Q3ZjUzNTJlNzRjNGE5ZDgwMWFhNzhjM2NiNzhk">Her girlfriend was so dependable! She hoped she could glare at people like that one day! Of course, only if they were being villainous!</p>
<p class="cnNhZTcwY2MyN2ZhNjQ3YTRhNzA3MWE4N2YwYzIyZjU2">They continued their way out of the slums, eventually coming to a street different from the others. The street, magically cleaned at one end and manually cleaned on the other, visually demonstrated the magical extent of her healing and cleaning magic. At the magically clean end, freshly-healed demons were celebrating and enjoying their new-found health, while at the other end, the residents had exited their houses only to see what the fuss was about.</p>
<p class="cnM5OGI2NTViY2ZjNDRhMWFiODM2ZDY3OTdiNmQxMTMz">Immediately, Amelia felt a little guilty. Hopefully, these demons wouldn’t be upset they missed her spellwork. At the very least, their street was where the quality of life started to improve; the street was well-lit with aetherlights, and the shop windows were glass.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDE1NGFkMDlhMDRjNzM4ZmMyNjdkODAzOTEzYTYz">Passing through, they arrived at the plateau lifts, where the guards and station employees struggled to keep things in order. Her magic might not have reached this far, but they had <em>seen</em> it.</p>
<p class="cnNjM2E1OTVkNGE3OTRlMWY5ZWRhNjYwOWEwOGNiZjk1">“What was that golden light!? An explosion!?”</p>
<p class="cnMwZWYyOTg0YWRiZDRkN2ViNDE5Yzk2OTVlYmJjMTM0">“It made me feel warm, it was strange…”</p>
<p class="cnM5ODQzNjc3MzFiMDQ0ZmY4YTM0Y2Y3NTA0ZTcwMzg0">“I hope nobody got hurt!”</p>
<p class="cnM1ODg2MjIwMWY0ZDQyZDNhNDFiYTQ1OTE0MTVjOTdk">“We should get out of here!”</p>
<p class="cnMyODgxOGI2OGQ1OTQyMjg4YTUxYjg1NzQ5YmY3NjRi">The once orderly lines were chaotic, and it wasn’t until a captain raised a rifle and fired a round that they regained control of the situation. Serena wasn’t waiting in the queue, instead leading Amelia straight to the front. Men, women and children parted as they recognised the military uniform. The guards spoke to her respectfully, even if they cast a few wary eyes towards her. By now, people in the crowd were starting to recognise her.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDQ3YmM5MDJiNzQxMTNhOGY4YmJiMGQ2ZjA1MDE3">“That’s Amelia Thornheart! The Lord-Prospect!”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZWEwMDhjMGZkMTQzMDRhMzllZjM1MmVjYWUwMTA3">“Do you think… it was her?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNjNiMzkwYTBkMzQzNTBiMDM2ZWE1ZTQ5OWY1YTg3">“Was that explosion her magic?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YWFhNTk2NTNhMjQwYzhhZjQ5NTRjNWVjYTJlZjNl">“Why is she and the Hellfire Captain in the lowlands?”</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2RiOTIzN2QyMTRlMDJhM2YwYWE2ZTRjMzkyMjU2">Sensing the crowd getting excited again, the guards wasted no time getting them on the lift and sending them on their way. A few travellers were riding the lift with them, but they seemed too anxious to approach, settling on only casting a few glances their way and some hushed whispers.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2NmMWZhYjM1MTRlNTY5MWE1YWNhZDEzMTVkZGY1">As the lift belched steam and the enormous gears began working, it brought them above the rooftops. In the distance beyond, the rest of the lowlands stretched out to the horizon. While her golden light had faded, when Amelia looked down upon the slums, an enormous circular area, perhaps a kilometre wide, stood out from the surrounding urban sprawl. The now perfectly clean rooftops shone, reflecting both the blue hues of the moon above and the cold light of the winter sun.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2Q4NTQ0NGYzOTRiMTliY2UzNDk1YWY2YjM5ZmZh">To think, she’d done <em>all that</em>!</p>
<p class="cnM5MmJiN2M4ODliMTRjMzA5NmVlNGI3YmIwMWY0ZWY0">With that thought in mind, Amelia cast a sound-proofing ward around her and Serena.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDc2MTc0MDQ3MzRmYWM5ZGZhMWUzMGViYmVhNjRm">“Sorry,” she said. “I was just so…” She clenched her fist. “I really don’t think I could have done it another way. I saw so much of <em>myself</em> in Kiku that I sort of…” She shuffled her feet. “...Lost control.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNDg3Mzk4Mzg4MDQ4NzA4OTZhYTZlYmVmNzcxYThm">Serena gave her a small smile. “I don’t blame you. Seeing what was going on… even I struggled to believe it. I, too, would have taken similar action in your place.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMjJkMmE3NWIzNTQ5ZWQ5MDJiYWE5YzhiYWU3MjJk">“R-really?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNDQ5ZDAwZDdjODRhMjdiMjI5Njg2ZWRlNjZkNzJi">“Well, I would have been a little more <em>discreet</em>,” Serena intoned, holding her thumb and forefinger millimetres apart, one edge of her smile curling more. “Imagine all the gossip this is going to cause.” Serena shook her head. “Honestly, what are we going to do with you? Can’t take you anywhere!” Serena looked at her with warm, loving eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzY1ZTAxODE5YTRmYjk4ZjBkZTlmOTYyZjZlYjNm">“So, you’re not mad at me?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNDJlOWI5ZWQyMzQ1Y2JhNmQ2NDM1ZTk4MDUwYWE3">“No, idiot,” Serena laughed. “I might get a headache, but why would I get mad at you being…” She waved her hand, gesturing at Amelia from head to toe. “<em>You,</em>” she finished. “That’s what I like about you…” she mumbled, breaking eye contact.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGZiYWI1YzU5MzRhZmVhMGIwMmZmNmFjYTFiM2Uw">“Thanks,” Amelia smiled. </p>
<p class="cnNmMjFhMWJlY2RiYjQ2YzJiYThlZTc2YTJkMDk2ZGZi">Ah, her girlfriend was so dependable and accepting, wasn’t she?</p>
<p class="cnNmZTNjYTRjMjE1ZjRkMDM5ZTUwMjM0Y2JhMGE0Yjcx">“Although…” Serena raised an eyebrow. “Your tab is building up.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODhlNjFlOWU1ZDRlYjc4NjAwMjMwZWJhMzA0YjJm">“My tab?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmFmMTE1YzNjZDQzNGE5ZTQ4MjFhMDlkNGNlYmJm">“That’s right.” Serena nodded as if she were talking about the most serious of matters. “The tab of cheek-pulling and hair-ruffling you’ll be subject to next time we’re alone.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMmVkNDM3ZGY0NDQzYzI4Yzk3ZGEyZmNlNDdhN2Nj">“O-okay!” Amelia spluttered, trying to hide her delight.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTA4ZGRlNTU0NzRlNWU4NTEwMmE1MWUyNjYwNWFm">After all, this meant Serena was going to reward her, didn’t it!?</p>
<p class="cnNlZDc4ZjQyMGU3MTRkNTk5YjVjMDg5YTViY2EzNTBl">Such a dependable, accepting, and loving girlfriend!</p>
<p class="cnMwZGIyZmFjZTFlZjRiNjZiMDczZWMzNmU2YWY0ZGI2">She was the luckiest human alive!</p>
<p class="cnM5NWEwNTc0ZmUyOTRlMzk5YmJmM2ZjMmUyODZlZTdm"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMmFiMGZiOWE5YTQ3YTBiZWMzNzY3Zjk5YWVmYTA4"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/oshiro.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTM1ODA4YjdlNjQ5M2M5NTdhZTJjNThhM2RkNTAw">“We’ll talk later. I’ll come and find you,” Oshiro instructed Highlord Yasuda.</p>
<p class="cnM4YmU4NmYxNDE0ODRmMjM5YmZlOWQyNTc2ZmYyNmRj">“Greatlord,” the highlord intoned. The man bowed deeply before leaving the office.</p>
<p class="cnMzMjNkOTYwZGE0YjQ0ZDQ5YzM2NWJjYTUyNTkyMWU0">After the door closed, a long silence developed. Highlord Yasuda’s report sat fresh in his mind, with Oshiro carefully considering his options. He ruminated for several minutes until the light clinking of a tea cup brought him out of his thoughts.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjhlODBkZjVhMzRlOGY4YWI2MDgzNThkZGU3ZDE2">“What’s your decision?” Chesterfield asked. The man was relaxed, and why wouldn’t he be? The action undertaken by Amelia Thornheart was precisely as he’d predicted.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTM0MTk0NTZhNjRjNDBhNzI5NWM3ZmQ5MWQ5ZTE1">“It’s not something we can hide,” Oshiro answered, his voice even. “Too large of an event around too many horns. We managed to limit the spread of the <em>Sakamoto</em> incident because it happened in the Wilderness during storm season. But this?” He clenched his hands together. “We have to ride this storm.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNzFjMjc5M2ZjMTRkYzE4OTJlMGQ3MWMwZWMyOTE3">“Mmm,” Chesterfield hummed. “She is like a storm, isn’t she?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTVjYTM5ODQ3ZjQzMzdiNTcyODFlNTNhOGMxY2Fh">“When will the Demon Church make their announcement?” He asked, ignoring the casual remark.</p>
<p class="cnNjODM0YmEzMTJjMzQzMWJiNjE5MzllNTJlMDE2Mjk5">“There are still some bighorns resistant to the idea of canonising a <em>human</em>,” Chesterfield explained with a sigh. “But the Imperial pressure we’re putting on them is only increasing. This event will give us the leverage we need. It’s also good timing; the incoming moonrain will keep people distracted. The extra time will allow the problematic Lords to untwist their horns.”</p>
<p class="cnM4YmI3NDk0NWQ1MDQwZTBhMGQ3ZmQ1MTJjNzUyMmQ0">Ah yes. The problematic Lords. Despite the fact she was entitled as a Speaker, Thornheart becoming a Lord-Prospect caused discomfort amongst many of her peers. Now, she would cause even more ripples from this mass-healing event. The only saving grace was she healed the bottom rung of society. At least the Far East couldn’t claim <em>their </em>peers were hoarding the human’s capability for themselves.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjBlYTc3M2M2ODRjOTI5ZWQyZTBmMjAxMmJhZmJh">“I’m surprised,” Chesterfield continued. “That you’re letting Highlord Yasuda take credit for this scheme. Normally, something of this magnitude would fall upon your shoulders, Greatlord.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYWRkN2NjY2Q0ZTQyMGFhODg5ZGY1OGJkM2E2ZmUz">“We’ll use the celebratory nature of this event to cover up Lord Kanamori’s punishment. His corruption is embarrassing for Highlord Yasuda, and his embarrassment is my embarrassment.” He gave Chesterfield a hard stare. “I will not let the blame fall on him. I will shield him from any naysayers.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YzI1Y2EzZmFlYjRhMWVhZmJhNTVmODAyYTgzZWM3">“Generous,” intoned Chesterfield, taking a sip from his cup. “And who will replace this fallen Lord? The Asamaywa Station is the busiest part of the Eastern rail network. It needs Imperial oversight.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYWU4MjhmY2EyOTRkYmRhZTU2ZjdmYmUzODI3ZmJh">Oshiro grumbled his agreement. “I’m considering giving it to Highlord Corvus.”</p>
<p class="cnMwOWQ4ZWZmZWE5NjQxNDdhMWIzMzk2MGJiODdiNmM0">“Oh?” Chesterfield’s eyebrow rose, his mouth curling into an amused smile. “Now they will say the <em>Dragon</em> is even more ambitious.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMTU2N2QwNWIxZDQxZTg4NTM1MTQ5YTI4M2IyZGFi">Oshiro scoffed. “Of course he is. War brings out ambitious men. I didn’t become Greatlord by sitting down and tapping my horns!” He reached across his desk and refilled his cup. “The station will appease him, and with this conflict ending soon, his ambition will temper.” </p>
<p class="cnNkOGQ1NmYzNzUzODRiNjk4ZDM0NTMzYzBiNjBmMjM5">Highlord Corvus was a valuable man, earning both the title of Highlord and the rank of Rear-Admiral in the last eight years. He should be well-satiated with managing one of the most important territories in the East. And if he wasn’t… well, there was a limit to how fast and quickly one would be allowed to rise.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTNiNTBjYzcyMjQxOWNiNGY3MmI1ZGE5YTgxNDhi">They both sat in silence, drinking their tea. The honey fragrance filled the room, settling Oshiro’s mind. Eventually, feeling the time was right, he asked his old friend something that had been on his mind for a long time.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTJhNGQ1NGNlODQ5ZGNiNDU0ZWM0YTk5ZDM1OGQy">“How is she so powerful?”</p>
<p class="cnMzYTBkY2NiN2ViNDRkZjFhMjE0MGJhN2IzNWE4ZGUy">Chesterfield didn’t answer immediately, taking his time to delicately place his teacup on its saucer. “How powerful do <em>you</em> think she is, anyway?” he asked.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWE0MzU4MDMxNTRhMDg5MDJlNjY3ZDIxYjk4NGQ3">“She… feels like Vikram,” he answered frankly. “But I cannot understand how it’s possible. She is too young to have communed so many Words. Against her newly-achieved aura, I am confident. But her magic?” Oshiro tapped the desk. “I fear I may be embarrassed.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YzlhZTY0MmQ0ZjQ4ZDQ4ODBhMDkwNTVjMjEzZGNl">The question of Amelia Thornheart had been on his mind ever since the meal. The woman was undeniably friendly and of no threat to demonkind, but her amenable personality did not satisfy the question of her <em>power</em>. She wasn’t lying about her age. He’d met energetic mages who kept a youthful appearance with their <em>Kanaxai </em>glamours, but he could always detect the underlying wisdom of their actual age.</p>
<p class="cnM1NmJiNmVmNWE0ZTRmZDM5YTFkYmU2NmFiZWVjMDFh">Not with Lord-Prospect Thornheart. The woman was truly in her mid-twenties with all the youthful eagerness and naivety that often came with it.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDVmNjNmOTlkMDRlNmJiY2YzOWU2YzFhNTM4ZGZh">“I thought she was the Empress,” he admitted, prompting Chesterfield to laugh softly. “In disguise, of course,” he added. “She looks terribly similar to her, doesn’t she? If you put the right pair of Cerulean horns on her, she might even trick a few people, especially if she goes around healing people!”</p>
<p class="cnNkYWQzMDI0MDY1NDRmOGNhNzcxMzljYzdmOGUzZWE2">“We’re aware of the similarity,” Chesterfield answered, his voice even. “A happy coincidence, that’s all. If anything, it’ll make it easier for the Demon Church to name her as a saint. <em>Made in the Empress’s image</em>, and all that…” He trailed off, shrugging lightly before resuming drinking his tea.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2Q4MGZmNzJjYzQzMGFhZmIyMmIwYjU0MGQ5NDE5"><em>Was that a lie?</em> Oshiro thought. <em>Was it really a coincidence?</em> His old friend was almost impossible to read now, especially after the man received his blessing. He couldn’t help but suspect that below everything, beyond the games of politics and lords, there was a deep underlying connection between Amelia Thornheart and the Empress.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTk0YjA3ZGQxMjQxZTM4NjI5YzFhNWVhNDYwNTEw">Now, it seemed, was not the time to bring it into the cold moonlight.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDFkMzhlYjgyZTRlZTg5M2UxZmIyYWNkZDk0Yjg5">“The other girl,” he said, changing the subject. “Seonmi San. Are you confident she’ll stay under control?” He valued Serena Halen enormously and didn’t want to see trouble come to her because they forced unneeded dangers upon her crew. The addition of the mistwalker Noburu had a purpose, but Seonmi was more for their own end: to weaken the influence of the Far Eastern Lords now quietly whispering of rebellion.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGVjMDU3ZWI4OTRhYmJiZTNiZDFkMTk3MmFhNjFh">“We’ve made her understand that regaining her House is contingent on impressing Captain Halen,” he placed his teacup down, blinking twice at Oshiro. “Or will that be Commodore Halen?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMjdjYjNmOTQzODQ5NjQ4MjNmOWVkZDBjNmU2YWRl">“Are you unhappy about my recommendation?” Oshiro asked.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmQ4M2IwMzgyYTRiM2I5OTkxZDc2ZWUxYTk2Mjk4">“Not at all. It’s something we envisioned happening in the future. If Captain Halen can achieve so much with one ship, imagine the results she’ll manage in the <em>next war</em> as Commodore Halen, with an entire squadron of ships.” Chesterfield looked to the side momentarily. “Although I wish you’d notified us first. She’s working for Intelligence now, remember.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NTJlYTgyOTI0OTQ0NDdiZTRjYzdlODUwYzI0Zjc4">“I have no obligation to do so,” Oshiro pointed out. Imperial influence had grown dramatically over the Terra Firmas in the last eight years of conflict. As the Empress enacted more and more wartime powers, the Lords of the Empire found their autonomy shrinking by the year. Many, including himself, were looking forward to the end of it all.</p>
<p class="cnM2N2QwMmExMDU2ZTQ5OTNhN2IxMWY4OTA2MTliMWU0">The words Chesterfield said ran through his mind once again.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTQ4OTM0YzY3YjQzODJhYzdhNDgyMzY3Y2Q5ZDA2"><em>The next war</em>,<em> </em>the man had said.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDc0NmYyYWIwMDQ5M2RhNmZiYzg2YzI5M2VmNGY4">Maybe it was a slip of the tongue, or perhaps it was intentional. Either way, it was strangely reassuring that his old friend, with the power he held, was as pessimistic as he was regarding the prospect of a long peace.</p>
<p class="cnNhZWUzODFhMmZhMTRmZGI4NGZkY2E5NTA4MmIxY2Mz">May the Empress protect them all.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzVjNDc5OGNiZTQ0NzBhODUzMDhiMGI1OThjNGNm">And the moons fall upon her enemies.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNiMDIzY2U1NTgwZDQ5MGJiNjk4NmRkZmQ4ZjNhNWI1"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGVlZjA2Y2JjYzRmOTM5N2Y5MWI0ZmQ1MjA1ZmRm">Amelia carefully continued her walk up the magic tower’s staircase, glad to see that Lunaria’s floor was finally in sight. It had been a slow process; the stacked plates of cooked meats and cheese bites were one wrong step away from causing an avalanche of nibbles. She’d enlisted Mel’s help, trying to convince her that this would be some form of balance training. The warrior wasn’t convinced, but still happily came with her to and from the kitchens.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmU1MjdmODUyYjQyYjFiZGI4MTc5OGQwZGFiNTE1">“I’m dizzy,” Mel muttered. “Every time I come up here. Twelve floors of winding staircase! Why do mages always build towers? Why can’t they stay closer to the ground like normal people?” She shook her head. “Honestly, I think they do it just to mess with us.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYzU4YzRmNWU4NjRiZDU5ZjczYjE0M2Q0YTZiNTdl">Amelia giggled, causing the trays to wobble. “Ah!” She exclaimed, rebalancing the precarious stack. “There we go… phew!” She pondered Mel’s words for a moment. “I don’t know; I always thought it had to do with the circles.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYjAwMDhhODE1NzQ3YTJiMjkxOTZmNTY2Y2VlMzRm">“Circles?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MzAwMjg4NDk4NTRlZGE5MDg1MjQ2NTdhYWQzM2Q0">“Yeah, First-Circle, Second-Circle and so on. From a bird's eye view, the floors of the tower would be circles, right? And there are twelve: three circles of magic for non-Speakers, three after the First-Word, three after the Second-Word, and three after the Third-Word. Makes sense, right?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNTVjMTVmZTI1NDRkNGE4NzNlM2VjYTI5NDNiZjU4">“Mmm…” Mel hummed. “Could be that.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNmY5YjdlZThlZDQxNGM4ZjNmN2EyZmE0OTJjZTA5">It seemed logical enough to Amelia. Still, the magic accessible after the Third-Word, the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth circles of magic were more or less mythological concepts to the mages here. Their only understanding came from imaginative stories coupled with scripture documenting the Empress’s actions throughout history. She decided not to mention the different, titanic powerful forms of power she was able to access in the game. She didn’t know if they existed in this world and dared not invoke them in case they did!</p>
<p class="cnNhNGM0ZWExYjA3OTQ3ZjRhOWI0NDQ5YTc1M2M1Yjdj">She’d barely controlled the Second-Word, and the one after that was frightening enough!</p>
<p class="cnM4NmI0OThlNWFkZjQwYzVhMWY0YzM1MTRiNjEwYmMw">Together, they managed to enter Lunaria’s observatory without dropping any nibbles. She even got a small ovation as she caught the attention of the other moonrain party-goers.</p>
<p class="cnNkMWE5MmE1MDAzYjRhZTg5YWJjMTUwODVjYzI5YmJk">She and Mel were able to place their haul on a nearby table.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODI3MDM4MThjMDQxM2FiMzkzMzZhODJkYzM4MWIy">“You should have asked for me, Assistant Instructor!” A voice called. Amelia turned to see Hinako approaching with a look of guilt on her face. “I would have helped!”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTk1NjNiNjljZDQ5ZDliNmFmZGQ3OWYxOGEzYjZj">“Amelia,” Amelia cheerfully replied. “Not Assistant Instructor, remember? Amelia’s fine, Hinako! Okay?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YzRkNThlMThkMDQ0YzliZDlmYzM2YWM0NDk0N2M0">“Oh…” Hinako looked to the left and right before leaning in and half-whispering, “But there are so many other staff around! Even <em>Speakers</em>! Are you sure it’s appropriate? Eee-!” The woman jumped; Lunaria had appeared next to her like a ghost.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDg3MjcwNWJiYjRlMTI4MTlkZDdjMWZiZWUxNWVk">“Do not worry yourself, young woman,” Lunaria intoned, her aged face showing mirth. “This is a casual event, and dear Amelia is…” She paused for a moment. “A casual person, isn’t that right? You won’t be offending anyone to use her name here.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNDJhYWQyY2E0YzQ0NTI4ZTIyOTlkMjMwYjhkMThj">“I see!” Hinako bowed. “Thank you, Head Instructor!”</p>
<p class="cnNjYzQ2MDVhMGVjOTQwZmNiNmM0NTI2NjAzZjVlOGZl">“Amelia,” Lunaria continued, “Would you like to see the view? The balcony is open.” The Head Instructor gestured to the side of the room where large sections of the wall had slid together, leaving wide openings to enter the balcony that ran the rim of the observatory. Amelia looked up, seeing the roof was closed in anticipation of the coming moonrain.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDNiMzIzZDUwNzQxY2U5ZDEwYTc3YWNhM2IxZTlk">“Mmm, sure!” she said, nodding happily.</p>
<p class="cnM4MzQxNGI0ZDlhYTQzZThhYzk5NjNmMTczMWI0M2Nm">Lunaria led her outside. The balcony was slim, extending not much more than a meter. Above it, a sloped roof would protect them from falling moonstones. Beyond… the city of Asamaywa was laid out in all its beauty. From this high up, she could even see Asamoto to the north!</p>
<p class="cnM3MjRkODgyYmM4MjRhNzdhNGQ3ZDZmZmI3MWQ4MjUw">The Three Sisters were fascinating, similar in some ways to Kenhoro but also very different. The architecture was mostly the same, with the same sloped roofs and stylised pagodas, but there was a distinct lack of <em>kami</em> depictions. It seemed that the Quinto religion wasn’t as popular here as it was further to the west. Stone was used more in construction, as was plaster. The city had a kind of <em>grandness</em> that was hard to pinpoint.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDU1NzJmNjRmNzRkNzM4YzhjYTgzZDNhMjU0MTM4">Well, it wasn’t the capital of the Eastern Terra Firma for nothing!</p>
<p class="cnM0MmU3MTkwMjRhOTQ2N2M5MjYxZTJkNjJhYjk5Zjgx">Amelia leaned slightly over the balcony, looking up.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTc5OThhZGMzNjQzMDM4ODA5YTJjMTViNjcyNGY0">“Whoa…” she muttered, the view causing her mouth to drop open.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWI3ZmUzYjU5ZTRiYjI5Y2Y4MGI2MjBhMWY4ZDM2">It was night, with the moonrain due to start any minute. Contrasting against the darkness, the blue-hued sky above <em>glistened</em>. Thousands, no, <em>millions</em> of moonstones, no, <em>aetherliths</em>, were primed to enter the denser parts of the atmosphere. They sparkled in the night sky, reflecting the moonlight. It was the most beautiful thing she’d ever seen.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWY5MTg2ZTc0YzQwOGQ4Y2Y5NmFkMmYyMmE2OTU4">Well, the most beautiful <em>inorganic </em>thing. <em>She </em>existed, after all, and Amelia was well aware of how thoroughly adorable <em>and</em> beautiful she was!</p>
<p class="cnM2YjczNTgyYmI4ZTQ1OGZiZTJlZjFlMmEyMThiZmE4">And then, she supposed, above even her…</p>
<p class="cnM2YWY4ZTE4OGRmZjQxZTg4NTY5NGJkNjIzNzhjNWJj">Was Serena!</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjEwYjZjMjQ0ZTRkYzQ4NWVmN2VhNjE5MWRlNDNm"><em>Careful. Going to make myself blush!</em> she thought, scratching her cheek.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2Q0NTFmNjgzNDQwNTZiYzI3YmQ0ZGNlNjM1MTU4">When was Serena going to arrive, anyway? Amelia looked around, not seeing the telltale pair of horns amongst the chattering party-goers. Serena didn’t believe Amelia’s claims that she could pick out her pair of horns from a crowd of thousands. Little did her girlfriend know, she’d burned the exact shape of her horns into memory, never to be forgotten!</p>
<p class="cnM5NTkxZjI0MmYxNzQwMTQ4NmIzOTYzNjFkZTMwYTQ4">“The moons have blessed us with a clear night,” Lunaria said softly. “Look to the west; you can even see the Yellow Moon of Centralis.” Amelia followed Lunaria’s finger, surprised to see the tiny yellow orb above the Asamaywa Mountains. It had a regal warmth to it. Amelia couldn’t help but wonder what it would be like to live in Centralis, where the population was bathed in yellow light every night. She’d already grown used to the blue light in the East.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2U1ODRiMGQzMTRiMjViNDZhOGNhYjMyYzg2ZjI3">“Whoa! Are any others visible?” she asked, stretching her neck to get a better look.</p>
<p class="cnMyODRjZjNlODVjMTQzNzdhZjU2YjczMDk2YWI2MmZi">“You might glimpse the Red Moon of the South if you catch it on its apogee, but it’ll be hazy. You’ll be looking through the atmospheric dust of the Shattered Isles <em>and </em>the desert. You can get a decent view most nights from Ponan. The Southern Lights become particularly intense after the red moonrain.”</p>
<p class="cnM3OTNiZmM3NDE3ZDRiZDViMDNiMTEyYjNmYzUwYzkw">“Southern… Lights?” Amelia echoed, tilting her head.</p>
<p class="cnNiZDE2OTAxZDI2NDRiZDFhN2ViNDU2ZmEwZDRhYWU5">“You’ve never seen them?” Lunaria asked. “Or heard about them?” When Amelia shook her head, the Head Instructor continued, “It’s an atmospheric phenomenon of how red moonlight behaves when it bounces through the desert dust. It looks like…” Lunaria motioned with her hand. “Ribbons of silk, made of light, hundreds of miles long, dancing along the atmosphere.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjJiN2UwYTcwNzRlZGE5YzZjZTU2OTNjY2NkOTFk"><em>Oh…</em> Amelia’s brain clicked. It sounded similar to a well-known phenomenon in her old world! She’d never had the opportunity to travel to the Arctic Republic to see them in person, but she’d enjoyed the experience through her gaming headset many times!</p>
<p class="cnNlZTM5MWNhMTMwMjQ1MDI4YzdlZmViNmI1M2NiMGE1">“Sounds amazing!” she said, smiling happily. The Southern Lights would be another item added to the list of things she’d have to see with Serena! Speaking of… she looked around, again failing to find Serena’s horns amongst the crowd.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDhiMGY5ZTliMzQ4NTQ5ODQxYmM5MTA1MWM5ODZl">It was strange that her heart would still beat so much in anticipation of seeing her despite only leaving her presence a few hours ago! Was she still in what they called the <em>honeymoon phase</em>? Every time she thought that the butterflies in her stomach had stopped fluttering, they fired back every time she saw Serena smile or blush!</p>
<p class="cnMxODI4OTdmNTVjYjQ5OTg5MGZjYWU1ZGY3YTgzYjU0"><em>I’m sorry Ren,</em> Amelia thought. <em>Your blushing gives me a positive feedback loop. Hang in there!</em></p>
<p class="cnNiNzViYzJlMjgwMDQ2ZGY4YTFiMjZiNjgwNTI4YzY0">“You’ve been busy today, I see,” Lunaria said, bringing Amelia’s attention back to her.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDg5OWU4NDhkMjRlMzk4NmVmNjFlYzE3NzI1NjNk">“Mmm?” Amelia replied.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDEyNGUxODdlZjQyNDU5Mzc5ZmFiMjZmODNiYzM2">“Your mass <em>healing</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYjE1MjgxMTUyMDQ5Yzc4ODgxYzVjYjA2ZDRlOWZm">“Oh!” Had everyone here already found out about it? Had news travelled that fast? “I’m surprised you knew already… but I suppose you sensed it.” Any mage of Lunaria’s talent would have found whatever they were doing rudely interrupted by Amelia’s magic. The ripple in the aetherfield would have given whoever manned the aetherscopes a scare.</p>
<p class="cnM1NmVkODc0YWI5YzQ3MWM5YTVmYzc2YmMzZThjYzcw">Amelia sent a silent apology to them. Hopefully, they didn’t have to stay up late buried in paperwork because of her!</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2IxNTZhNjQxYjRmYWRhZTI2OWZhMmVmODIyYTRj">“I got some fascinating readings of <em>Aseco’s</em> magic. Good data.” Lunaria cast her a glance, her eyebrows rising. “You wouldn’t mind doing it again a few times? For me?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMGE0YmFkYTg0MTQwNTk4NWUwN2YwMzIwYTc2ZjVh">“Ah…” Amelia smiled, scratching her neck awkwardly.</p>
<p class="cnM5NWUyZTdjOGE1ZjRhNjZiYmQ0NmU2N2VhYTVkODJm">“Only jesting, dear,” Lunaria said. “Poor Oshiro. What a headache he must be having!” The old instructor cackled to herself. “Serves him right, ha!”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTM0Y2M1ZDQ0NjRjODZiYmE2NGU3YWE0NWMwZDk5">“You… know him?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZDc0NTNlODkyYjQwZDJhOGQzNmU3YWFkMjNlZGZk">“We go back,” Lunaria answered. “Mostly as friends, but we’ve been borderline enemies at some points. Polite enemies, that is. I was rather… rambunctious in my youth. Although so was he, now that I think about it…” She coughed into her hand. “Well, I’m just an old woman who enjoys moon-watching. Forgive my rambling, dear Amelia.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYTlmY2M3YjRkYTQzMzdiYTAyNDFlZjhhN2UyOWQy">“No problem,” Amelia replied with a grin.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDQzOWRhN2ZkYjQ0NzI4OWZkMGI3NmY3ODQyMWYy">“Why were you in the lowlands, anyway?”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTI5NWQ4MjgwNDQ1NDNhODgxYjg0ZWQ1MWYzODFm">Ah, that was right. Amelia and everyone else were supposed to keep Noburu and Seonmi secret, for their own and the academy’s sake. Amelia had yet to sign any documents; the trip to the slums and the events there had delayed such things. Given the Lord Guardian’s instruction to stay put within the academy, she was sure she’d be asked to sign something similar soon.</p>
<p class="cnMzMGI5NDRiYTQ2MzRlNzNhM2Y5OGMxMzU4YzQ2OTk5">Even so, she would make sure she could tell Serena anything.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjRkMmY2MTgzMTQ5YzhiMDMwYTg3YmJjYjUzNDA4">“Umm…” she began. Her brain spent all of two seconds trying to come up with an explanation before giving up. “Can’t tell you!” Amelia settled on the truth. “And I can’t tell you why I can’t tell you, so don’t ask me about it! Please!?”</p><span class="cmRiODdlMzY3MWUyODRiMGFhOTI1NGYzMDE2ZWRiNDk5"><br/>The story has been taken without consent; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyOGQ5MjE1NTllMjRhNDQ4N2RiOTc4ODM5ZTM0ZDUx">In response to her pleading eyes, Lunaria chuckled. “I’m no suitor swayed by a pretty woman’s eyes. Fine then, I’ll respect your privacy. Still, what a bold action it was. The sirens were awfully loud. We had to go into lockdown until we got the all-clear. It was all very exciting. Be warned, though,” Lunaria leaned in slightly. “I’m not the only one wondering how you were involved in this mess. Rumour has it the lowlanders are celebrating right now, giving prayers and thanks to the <em>golden healer</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNjI1MDRmMGQzNDQ1NDA5MWI1N2I1YzY2NGRlOWI4">“Well…” While Amelia was able to stop her hands from reflexively touching her golden hair, she couldn’t stop herself from swelling with pride. It felt <em>good</em> to do <em>good</em> things! She should do them more often! “Is that so…?” she finished, purposely trailing off.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmVkZjNhYzRmYjQ3NGE4ZTgyYzNiZjNkZjQ2MjZm">“I wonder, are all human mages this inclined to get involved in all kinds of situations?” Lunaria asked, her mouth curling into a sly smile.</p>
<p class="cnNlMTFlNmEwZGU1ZTQ5N2Q4MmY0MDIyZDY1YmRjZTFk">“No!” Amelia replied cheerfully. “Just me! World’s only big enough for one Amelia!”</p>
<p class="cnNmNDk1YTBlODQ1NzQ1YTE5MGIzOTM5NWE3Mjg5Yjc4">“Ha!” Lunaria scoffed. “Thank the hells for that… Speaking of the hells, look upwards. What a brilliant moon we’ve been blessed with. Don’t you think? What do you think when you see it?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OWNkOTU4ZGIzODQxYTZiMDM1OTg5MWQ0ZjlkM2E0">They both looked upwards, staring at the shining moon. Maybe it was her imagination, but the longer they looked at the moon, the more uneasy the atmosphere became. Amelia hadn’t missed the implicit question at the end of Lunaria’s sentence.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWUxNGJhYWNiNTQ3ZTdiZTNhNmVmOWU5YzMxYzBi">“Would it be impolite if I cast a sound-blocking ward?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnMxMWI5NmM4MWI2NTQwNzA4NDVjOGNiYjg2ZDUzMDBl">“Keep it short, and no one will take offence,” Lunaria replied.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzk3MTdmZWY2NjQzMWQ5NTQxMjY2MjY5OGMyYmY4">Amelia cast her magic, preventing any of the other partygoers from eavesdropping.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjk3NWVmOTM3ZTQ2ODZhYjJkNWUwZGE5NjlmZmY2">“Did you… manage to look at it?” Amelia asked tentatively. “In the Shimmer, I mean.”</p>
<p class="cnNhM2I4MWU1ODUyMTQwZGNiOTNiODkzNjA3NzMxZDdj">“...Yes,” Lunaria answered in a flat voice.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDZkMTRkNzIxMjQyN2M5YzQxMTc3YTgzZGVhMjc2">“I’m… not sure what to think. It can’t be known only to us, right?” Amelia asked. “I just… I’m not exactly sure what I’m looking at. Is it… alive? Is it… an egg? They’re not going to hatch, are they?”</p>
<p class="cnMyZTE4OGNkYTc1MDQ4YmVhMmUwYWI0MGNiYzFiNDEy">“I was shocked at first,” Lunaria replied. “And I had similar thoughts. Then, I remembered my mythology and my theology. There’s old, and I mean <em>old</em>, stories in the North, which whisper that the moons are prisons.” The Head Instructor’s voice dropped low. “Dragons,” she whispered. “Ancient rulers of the world, long before the humans arrived, long before the Needles of Nai were built. But…” She clicked her tongue. “There’s also a branch of the Church that believes the moons were where the Empress banished the most powerful Titanlords, and the reason they approach every cycle is because they’re trying to return, only to be pushed back by her powers.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjExNmFiYzcyMTQ4MmNhNzBkMjI5ZGRmZjJjNTBk">“And, of course, we have the tribal desert beliefs. Some believe the Empress is the <em>Great Spider</em>, the animal gods her children, and the moons…” Lunaria gestured towards the night sky, “...Are her eggs incubating more animal gods… Oh, by the way,” she leaned in slightly. “If you talk to Instructor Abbas about desert beliefs, do it politely. The man’s already frustrated at people assuming all the desert stereotypes apply to him. The South is a large and varied place, and they often get lumped into one pair of horns.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYzQ2NjY2ODRmZDQyODZhNjBmYzQyNjdjMWM2ZTNh">“Understood! As for the moons… so… no one knows?” Amelia finally asked. She was happy to see her tentative theories already represented in the Empire’s plethora of cultures, but she was a little disappointed that there wasn’t a solid answer.</p>
<p class="cnNlOGNiZWFlOTcyZjQ5NGQ5YjY5MDIzYTExYzE0MGVj">“Someone might <em>know</em>. Perhaps they are prisons.” Lunaria shrugged. “Or eggs. Or prisons the Empress birthed from eggs.” She chuckled, clearly not giving the thought much credit. “But you were right about one thing; they certainly <em>know</em>.” The demon’s eyes sparkled, and she lowered her voice even more. “A <em>Lord Guardian</em> appeared before me! It happened this morning. I was there, writing out my observations of the Shimmer, in this very room, then<em> snap</em>,” Lunaria snapped her fingers. “She was just standing there, in shining white and gold! I nearly shat myself! <em>Ahem!</em>” Lunaria coughed. “Apologies, privacy has a way of bringing out colourful language, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p class="cnMyMTNmMjVmMTQ3ZTQzMjE5NmNiNWI4OTNmN2M5YTBh">Amelia giggled. “I also met a Lord Guardian recently, but it was a man! What did she say to you?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMTdlYzk5MDI1ODRlODdhNzVhZDJmNTA0ODM3YTU4">“Another one!?” Lunaria’s eyes widened. “Seven hells, is the Empress attending my party or something!?” The demon smiled at her joke. “It wasn’t much,” she said. “She told me not to be too loose with my lips and to remember I needed Imperial permission to publish anything on the subject. I was terrified! They’re so… <em>imposing</em>. Truly as the stories say, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMjNhM2U5Y2FlYTQ2NDdhM2JjNTIyNjhlMDQ5Mjk4">“Y-yeah!” Amelia nodded, trying not to recall the friendly conversation she had regarding brewing mint tea. “Powerful, too! Their souls are so bright in the Shimmer!” she added hastily.</p>
<p class="cnNhYmI2NDAyMTM4NzQ5Y2Q5Y2EzZDYxZjUxM2IxMTUx">Lunaria shook her head. “I dared not look at them through the Shimmer, lest I offend them! You know they’re among the few people in the Empire with the right to execute Cascadian Lords, only needing their own justification?” She shuddered. “Frightening stuff, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="cnMzODI2YTE4NGU1ODQ5MTNiZTZjNzNhYmIzYTYzNWI0">“Oh! Yes!” Amelia agreed. That may be, but the Lord Guardian she’d met definitely had a <em>good</em> soul. She never felt like he was a threat to her at any point. In fact, he seemed rather <em>sweet</em>. Like a protective Grandpa…</p>
<p class="cnMzMzIyODc1OTQ4YTRjMjc4YWE4NWQ0NWYyNDc0MzYz">“You should drop the muffler now, dear. We don’t want your fellow guests thinking we’re gossiping about them.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMjYyOWFjYWIxZDRjMzM5MGQ2Zjg3MGZiZDQ2MmM1">“Okay!” Amelia ended the magic.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzRhYzlhZmU5NzRmYzA5MjcwNTc5ZjFiOGI1YmM2">After she did so, more people came onto the balcony, their auras or wards protecting them against the chilly night. They timed it well; within a minute, the first small stones started pinging against the academy’s rooftops. It sounded like slow, heavy hail. It was oddly mesmerising.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2FmOTA1ZDYyNjQ4YjZhMjU1ZDEzOWMwZTM5NDgw">“I’m not late, am I?” a smooth voice intoned behind her as a familiar presence made itself known. Amelia had to chew the inside of her mouth to stop herself from breaking into a happy grin. She couldn’t be <em>that</em> obvious in her delight; someone in the academy had reported them, after all!</p>
<p class="cnM1MjEzYTkyYmU5ZTRhMGJiYzhkOThmYTQ0MzdiMzZj">As for who it might have been, neither she nor Serena had any idea.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTQxNzA5OWM5OTRhNDA5NjRjNmI2ZGUxNTkwZmJj">“Just in time,” she whispered as the density of moonstones increased.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDkwNzVlMmRlZDQ4OGM4MTg1NmY3ZWRjYWYxMmM1">“Here,” Serena said, moving to Amelia’s right-hand side. “I bought a bottle of blue. Just in time, it seems.” Serena handed Amelia a glass filled with a light blue liquid. “Looks like a heavy one tonight,” she muttered, looking up.</p>
<p class="cnM1YjI5NTQzNzc1ZDQyZWM4ZDZjZmExZGNmOTVlNWQx">Amelia’s eyes widened at the familiar fragrance of blue loqua. She immediately took a sip. The drink brought nothing but <em>good</em> memories to mind. Memories of nights out with Serena and Aiden, nights with just Serena…</p>
<p class="cnM1NmY2M2YxYjMxNDQwNzViMzllM2UzMTZkZjgzNGYz">Her girlfriend wasn’t trying to get her drunk, was she!?</p>
<p class="cnNiM2VhMmVjOGQyZTRhZmNiODMwMWMwNzFhNTYwNjcy">Amelia suppressed a giggle. Not that she would mind. Some of their best nights together were conducted under the influence of loqua. It helped them to get over the initial awkward hurdles of learning each other’s bodies.</p>
<p class="cnNlMWRhODJlZTRjNjRhZjM4NDBjZjAwNWZiNWVmNmQ1">Ah, she was starting to blush!</p>
<p class="cnM2M2U0YTQ4MmI0NTQ0ZjI4NmZhNjFkMmFjNWNkZWE4">“Thanks,” she whispered, turning to the left to hide her flush. There, she came face to face with Mel, who, instead of looking at the moonrain, was looking at Amelia with a complicated expression.</p>
<p class="cnNmZjY0ZjQxNTcyZjRjYTY4YWNlYWQzNjU1NzE5N2E5">“N-nothing!” Mel spluttered, turning away.</p>
<p class="cnM5MWEwNjg1ODQyNTQ0OTc5ZTdjMDExMjE1ZGY4ZGE5">What, did she want some loqua as well? They were friends! Of course, she could have some! She must have been too nervous to ask. It was an expensive drink, after all.</p>
<p class="cnM2YWFlNDczOGFkMDQzMTViOGNkZTdiMDQzMzJkNDIy">“Here,” Amelia said. “Take this; I’ll share Serena’s.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MjY1NDE1ODE0OTQ2ZTA4YWJkNGQyNGJkM2VjODk2">“S-share?” Mel muttered for some reason. Still, her friend took Amelia’s mug and, after some hesitation, took a sip. The moment she did, her eyes widened.</p>
<p class="cnM5NmFlYzRhYWE0ZDQ4MmNiMjllN2Q4NjQyNDFlM2Ey"><em>That’s how you become addicted,</em> Amelia thought. <em>Now, no other alcohol will come close to loqua!</em> <em>Sorry Mel!</em></p>
<p class="cnM0Yjg2YWIzZGIxZDRjMmVhODNiMjc2ZjYyNmU1NzRh">Amelia and Serena took turns holding the mug and sipping the delicious drink. The stones started coming down heavier now. The <em>pinging</em> had become more like <em>thudding</em> as larger pieces collided with the ground and roofs. Serena had said they slowed down, but these were going fast enough to kill anyone!</p>
<p class="cnM5NTljM2FkODlmNDQ2ZGNiYWVlMmE5NDYwMzJjNzlk">She was about to open her mouth to ask but then realised it was a terrible idea. To most people, she was a resident of the world. While she could use the excuse of a lack of formal education as to why she didn’t know the scientific or magical explanations for things to do with the moon, it would seem weird if she asked a question that made her sound like this was her first ever moonrain.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDIxMTE3MTA5ZTRjZTQ4MzI0MjJlMDAxNjE5ZmZj">It was a good idea to wait; as the moonrain intensified, the falling stones became brighter, and as they became brighter, they travelled slower. With her perception, she understood why. The moonstones with higher crystal content reacted stronger with the lumina and slowed down more. The rocks that were slamming into the ground were those that were, well, just rocks. The change was noticeable in the Shimmer as well. The plain rocks didn’t affect the aetherfield much, but the ones with more crystal bent the aetherfield towards them proportionally to the crystal content.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTllZmVmOWI0ZjQ4MDM5YjgxYWE3OTdhYzUzMTYw">As time went on, the descending stones increased in density. It was as if the heavens were falling - thousands of blue lights descending upon the world. If someone were to see this from her old world, they would think of it as a religious event. It was truly magical.</p>
<p class="cnMzMzk3OTVjMjFjMTQyMTc5NGQwODY2MDAzMDFhYmY5">Despite the odd loud thud, the sloped roof above them held well, as did all the roof coverings of the city's residents. However, she saw a few chimney pots get destroyed and broken. The streets were empty; it would be madness for an unprotected person to take a single step outside.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjNjMzQ4Njc4MTQ2NWNiOGIyYTFkNDc1ZDQ5Y2Zi">“A lot of smoke tonight,” someone said.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmFjYzljYjliYzQ1MTJhZTZlZTIxNWJkOTkxYmZm">Amelia was captivated by the night sky. The ground, no, all of Asamaywa, began to glisten as the moonstones continued to shine even after they landed. They didn’t shine like an aetherlight, they would need to be properly processed for that. No, they shone with a natural blue hue and glinted as they reflected the moon above. It was a beautiful sight.</p>
<p class="cnNkODk2NjNiNzU0OTQxOTNhMjZjNmE1ZjQxZjI2Mzg2">Even so, she had something more beautiful and pure next to her. Amelia couldn’t help but steal a few glances to the side, where the outline of Serena’s sharp features, lit by the blue moonlight, was intoxicating. The curve of her nose, her lips that were much softer than they looked… Amelia quickly looked away but found her mind pulling her eyes back towards her girlfriend. The tickle of butterflies in her stomach was as addictive as the loqua!</p>
<p class="cnMxYjU5ODQ1ZDY1NTQ0NDg4MDE2MzEyZDRlY2Q4Zjc4">“Focus,” Serena mumbled, her face clearly hiding a smile.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTRjZTAxZDgzOTQ3NzdiNGU1YzNmNTk4ZGYyZDEz">“Sorry,” Amelia whispered. She looked forward and then to the left. Mel was staring intently ahead, a blush on her face. Was she cold?</p>
<p class="cnMwMzA3NTc5MDc4YTRmOTM5NDQzN2Y5YWVkYWQ3NDY5">“There go the <em>Houks</em>!” Someone shouted, pointing to the distance. Amelia frowned, flaring her perception. There, in the sky beyond the city limits of Asamaywa, was a fleet of small ships flying through the moonrain. The ships looked strange, like nothing she’d seen before. It looked like someone had taken a normal fishing ship, like the ones she’d seen crossing the air space near Nai, and added a bunch of… buckets?</p>
<p class="cnM3MmFhMWNjMzRmODRiMzQ4ZWE1YzIxMTY2ZjNhYjZi">“They’re mad!” someone exclaimed.</p>
<p class="cnMxMGI2NGQ3YmQyNTQ3MjBiNWUwNzczMzUwYTM3YjAy">“Imagine what it sounds like inside!”</p>
<p class="cnNjNzM1NmIyMzhiYTRiYmE5OGRhYjcyMTY0N2FmZDc1">“You couldn’t pay me to do that!”</p>
<p class="cnNiMjIyODhiYTRhZDQ2MTFhZWM3MjU0M2ViNjQ2ZGFl">“Are those… buckets?” Amelia asked. “Are they trying to catch the moonstones?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MjZiNjI1OWYyYTQzNTBiNWMyNDQ3ZGI1ODI5NTYw">“Any crystal that falls upon a Captain’s ship is theirs to keep and use as fuel,” Serena explained. “In the East, due to the war, people cannot collect the crystals like they used to. Years ago, before the restrictions were in place, all the city’s residents would hang out buckets to catch as much as possible. Now, the only exception is the old law applying to those lucky enough to own a ship. The buckets are to maximise surface area. They make a profit, providing their ship isn’t destroyed. They’re nicknamed <em>Houks,</em> as in <em>Houk-class</em> after the famous Yellow Rogue, Erik Houk. He became known across the Empire for campaigning for the law to be passed. Wherever you go, you’ll see <em>Houks</em> every moonrain, some taking more risk than others.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YzM5YmY0YjkyYjQxYmQ4MGUwYjRjNzQxOTNlMjZj">Amelia decided there and then, if she ever had the power, she would ensure a <em>Halen</em>-<em>class</em> line of ships were made, all in honour of her girlfriend!</p>
<p class="cnM2YTkzYTM1YzU0NzRiMmY5YjI2NTAyNGNmN2NmZjY2">“Is it… dangerous?” she asked.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDM4ZjJmYWIyNzRhNDE5YjNjOTFiNTRjMmQ3YWVm">“A few ships go down every moonrain, but rarely fatal. Often, the cause is a rock hitting the flaperons or some other part of the ship critical to flight, so they have to make a controlled landing. As long as they sail over the lowlands and not the city, it’s fine. The real danger is to the people who go out on foot.” Serena sniffed. “I think something’s burning…”</p>
<p class="cnNjNjcyYWRlNWUxZTRhMzA5N2VlODUyZDMxMmRjYjIw">Bells started to ring across the city. Amelia saw Serena frown.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmMwZmVkNWJmZTRjYjFhM2YxMDQ4NzIwMmU4NWFk">“Fire!” someone in the room yelled. “There’s a fire! From below the city!”</p>
<p class="cnM3ODk1Yjg3YzdkOTRhYTQ4Y2ZkMmIzM2MxMTM3ZGJi">Everyone, including Amelia and Serena, rushed to the east side of the balcony, the structure barely wide enough to fit everyone cramming in to take a look. There, billowing up past the plateau's edge, were thick columns of black smoke. No longer did the falling moonstones capture anyone's attention. Instead, they were occupied with the abject horror of what the smoke implied.</p>
<p class="cnM1YWJhMWNiZTA1MjQyYzQ4MThkNTM5ZjI1MTEwMjRk">“Empress…” a muttered prayer was heard.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjdkN2ZkMGUxMDQyZjRhN2M5N2ZkYzI4NDhmZjYy">“That’s a big fire,” Serena said solemnly.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWZhMzZkODM5YTQwNzc4MTdkYTg3YTg3NzAyZjA5">“I-isn’t that?” Amelia turned towards Serena, her eyes wide. “Isn’t that where we were?”</p>
<p class="cnM3YjhlYjc4M2FiNTQ4ZmI4OTM2ZmI0ZTZlOWE0MWY4">Serena blinked before saying quietly, “...It looks like it.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMmU5ZmZiZmIxNTRmZWRhYzYwNGQzMzliNWUwMWU5">“Hail!” An instructor appeared in the room, judging by the sweat on his forehead, he had raced up all twelve floors. “Fire!” he exclaimed between breaths. “In the lowlands! Near the Asamaywa Station! Any mages or warriors who can protect themselves against the moonrain are asked to come! If you can’t protect yourself but are capable of water or ice conjuring, please find someone to protect you! It’s already engulfed four streets! It’s an inferno! Civilian firefighters are being struck by the moonstones! They need support!”</p>
<p class="cnM4N2QxZmJiMTkzMzRlMTdiNWU5NDI3YWU0ZDBmYzJl">A deadly silence took over the room.</p>
<p class="cnMwM2IyODYzYTEwZTQyYTk4OGYyODRhOGEzYWI3N2Rj">“Stop just standing there!” Lunaria bellowed, clapping her hands. “Let’s go! Their taxes pay for our salaries, so we should show them we’re earning it!”</p>
<p class="cnNhYTU3NzgxZjU4NTQzZTZiN2U5ZmE4ZTE1MmRiODdl">“I’ll come,” Serena said with a nod.</p>
<p class="cnM2MGU1ODBkMTY0YTRlNzU5YWViZmFhYTE5ODg5OTRh">“Me too!” Hinako declared.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjE0ZTZmMDBhODRjZGQ4Y2M4NzFhYmFiNDBmYjY2">“And me!” Mel added.</p>
<p class="cnMxMmUwMzZjYzZjYTQyNmZiY2I3OTY0NDRhOTM4OTJm">“There’s no time to waste,” Serena said, eyeing the staff members hurrying down the stairs. “Let’s jump. We can run to the city edge and jump from there.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYWRjNzM3ZjQ0ZDQwMmU5M2EwOWUyZDM4M2QxZWE2">Jump! What did she mean, jump!?</p>
<p class="cnM3OGI0ZDcxYjJlZTRmNDA4NDAyYWYwZTRkYmJhZjdj">As if reading Amelia’s thoughts, Serena said, “Just like in Kenhoro. Come on! People are dying!”</p>
<p class="cnM0YmYwNjFjMmIyODQ3MTM4ZWVlN2U0NjRmNDEyNTA0">“R-right!” Amelia tensed her fists. She’d grown since then. Now wasn’t the time to panic! She was sure Kiku and the children were safe, the Lord Guardian would keep his word. But what about the other residents? Her mind recalled the excessive jettying she saw in the lowland architecture. Her idle comment of it being a fire hazard was now fresh in her mind. Every second she wasted was more suffering that could be prevented.</p>
<p class="cnNjY2IxNmE2N2ZiZTQyZGRiYTJlZWVhNDYzOGE3MjY1">She moved to the balcony’s edge.</p>
<p class="cnNjOTYxNDhlYThjMzQyMDZiNTQxZjY2ODlmMjBlMDkx">And without any fanfare, without any crying or screaming, and, most importantly, without any hand-holding…</p>
<p class="cnMzYzc3MzM0MjAzZDQ2ODg4ODVmZjlhOTdhZWYzODM2">She took a breath and jumped.</p>

      <description>Chapter Seventy: The Great Asamaywa Fire</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNjY2M3NzBiZmQxMDQ3N2ViMDc4ZTQ1NjQ3YzM0MGJh"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjJkOGRmOGQ0YzRjY2M4YTBjOGFlY2Q2ODdjMjM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a brief sense of vertigo followed by rushing wind, Amelia slammed into the paving stones below, cracking the slabs. Compared to the time in Kenhoro, her level of control was better; she managed to land on two feet this time and not her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTNjNjFlOWVhZTQzNDE5NmE4YmYxNTBlMTBhOTQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-whoa!” she exclaimed, spinning her arms to reclaim her balance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGQ5MmE0Nzg3MDQzOWViYzJmZjI4ZWJkYmM1ZDE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, Serena landed next to her in a flash of black uniform and yellow aura. Her girlfriend bent her knees on impact before fluidly transitioning into walking. Serena made it look as if she’d just stepped off a stair. Amelia had to admit - it looked cool.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDlhNTAyNzZiZjRkNDBiMzAwZGVjMGIyZmEwOTAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel came next, flaring her aura into orange before smashing into the ground and rolling to the side. Then came Hinako, cycling her aether to push against the lumina far below to slow her descent. It worked a little, but she still landed heavy with an adrenaline-fueled scream.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWVhZjlkYjRhMjQzYjlhM2E4YmM5MDE5ZmYzZTJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, Lunaria came floating down. The massive quantity of aether the woman could control enabled her to descend elegantly. She made contact with the ground with a gentle kiss.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWUyYzU5ZTlkMTQzNjlhODMzYzkyYjc3NjFjNzJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We need to get to the plateau's edge!” Serena announced. As she spoke, a moonstone smashed into her shoulder, breaking into pieces. Serena didn’t even react; her yellow aura was sufficient to make such strikes meaningless. “Let’s run!” she shouted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWI5MDdlNTVjOTQ5NDRiMjEzMTcyYjQyMzBiYmU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia didn’t wait. She moved with determination, running through the academy grounds and jumping the wall. In the air, she had a moment of weightlessness, once again captivated by the beauty of the moonrain. Falling blue crystals littered her vision, sparkling with their light.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGI0MTRkMGM5NzRiYTk4MjY2MGFlMzY3ZGM0Y2Fi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she landed and, after a brief stumble, was off running again. Serena was next to her, and together, they were running faster than anyone had ever sprinted in her old world. They would be able to go faster, but the thousands of moonstones littering the floor posed a threat to their feet. One or both of them tripped and fell on more than a few occasions. Several times, Amelia ran </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">into</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a moonstone as it fell in front of her, slowing her down even more.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDc5OTIxMGJiYjRiYWViY2I5YTkwMjE1YzQ1MmE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">From behind, the voices of the others were heard.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWZkM2VjZjA5OTQ2NmM4OGExNjM2ODE5MTdiNmNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-how can they run so fast!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWYyZDM5Njk5YzQ5ZTk5MzU5NzNmOTVkZjhjMjZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Keep going Hinako, don’t trip!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjU4YzVkOTE5ODQwNWI5ZTk1MWQzZDVmM2FmNGQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjU2YTc1Y2IzNzRjZTY5MmY5ZDQ5MjRmYTg0ODRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Lunaria mumbled as she came up to Amelia’s side, practically gliding. “You can hear it now.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWM0OWQ4ZDI1ZDQ3MTdhMTIyYmNlNzcwYmNjYWEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Through the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">plinking</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thudding</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of thousands of moonstones, the sounds of the inferno from far below the city reached them. A harsh, continuous roar of the flames, joined by the cracking and popping of burning wood and the tinkling of exploding glass. Just as these sounds became known, they were joined by the city's sirens. The droning alarms were a different tone to the alarm Amelia had triggered before. A specific one for fire, perhaps? </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjBhMTZiZmQ3NTQ1MmNhYjc5MDhiYjMwOGRjMjMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The wind picked up as they crossed the last corner to the boardwalk along the city’s eastern rim. It pushed them from behind as if encouraging them towards the fire. It was not a natural wind but a wind born from the massive amount of superheated air rising with the black smoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDc3YWJmYzI1YjQxZjBiMzBlZjMxMGEzY2UyYTIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The group approached the rim, the scale of the fire now causing even Amelia to gawk in awe. Her mind struggled to comprehend the scale of what she was seeing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTZlOWY0MGVhZjQ4NzRiN2U0ZWM2YTg3NDUwMDVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though they were still several hundred meters above the lowlands, being this close to the city's edge put the fire into a new perspective. The black smoke didn’t look all that threatening from the magic tower, but being in front of it, it came across as an impenetrable wall of darkness stretching as far into the sky as Amelia could see. The smoke was so dense that moonstones falling into it seemed to blink out of existence, their soft glow unable to be seen through the smothering smoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDM5MThmNTQ0YzQzYTA4YjM4YjliYzQ1YmNkZjFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">To her left, mages with the uniform of a different academy were manifesting large spheres of water over the rim's edge, letting them fall. Civilian firefighters were holding a dozen water hoses, spraying jets of water down below, yet something seemed to have gone wrong with the water pressure, and they were struggling to keep a constant torrent of water flowing. Warriors stood beside them, holding large shields to fend off the falling stones.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWMyOWRjNGJmZTQ2YWE5ZTJkZDAyZmUwNTVkNDMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t see a thing,” Serena said, peering over the edge. “The heat! I’ve never felt anything like it!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzFiYTAyYjgzNjQ1MDg5M2YyYTc1MmIwMmI2NjNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia joined her, looking down at the billowing inferno. The heat was causing freak weather patterns, and some of the smoke was twisting into tornados. It looked like an unstoppable catastrophe. How could anyone survive that!? Could she even do anything!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2RjYzk1N2IxNzRiNjQ4MzA4NmIxZDA4NmYzODI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No! Amelia shook her head. She would push forward and not linger with hopeless thoughts! The Lord Guardian would have protected Kiku and the children; she was sure of his word. The important thing now was to do her best!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDRhYTQyZjY3YzQzNTNiZjhmZWE5MDBiNTA0OWVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Against this conflagration… with this quantity of water…” Lunaria mumbled, looking at the attempts of dozens of firefighters and mages. “I fear the water would only evaporate before it hit the ground. We need more water…” Lunaria turned to face Amelia. “It’s improper to ask, but given the situation… can you invoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Yemaya?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDMwMjMxMTQwYzRiNmQ5YjUxNDdmNTg4ZDFhNmUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Yemaya</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The human god of water.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTI5YTYxN2Q3MDQ1NTA4NjYwYzg0ZTlhNGNmYzVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia closed her eyes, trying to form the Word.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTRkYjhkMGZlOTRmM2I5ZjMxNWQyZjAzNzg3YWIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her aether didn’t respond. It wasn’t unexpected. Amelia’s abilities somewhat lined up with the game character she developed, and that character only learned the Words of Divinity so she could roleplay as a human healer! She never knew any other human Words!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDg0OTlhNGFhYzRjY2JhM2FkNTY0MDZiZGNjMDY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t,” Amelia replied. “What about </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> He’s the demon god of storms; would that make a difference?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMThkZDM2ZTkxMDQ1M2RhNGZjZjRlMDM2NDAxYTU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria shook her head. “His storms generate water but will bring lightning to start new fires and winds to spread the existing fire. It’s not efficient enough. I imagine the best way you could help would be to Speak </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and ward the warriors who will be evacuating people. You can then heal those they rescue. I fear…” Lunaria peered over the ledge, her expression darkening at the black expanse. “If you go down there, you risk dying from smoke inhalation. You may think you can constantly heal yourself, but one slip of concentration might be the end. It only takes one breath of smoke.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTM1ZDFjMzllOTQ4OWRiODI3MWZmYzM3YTQ1NWY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia swallowed. Sure, her healing was a fantastic addition to the situation, but why wasn’t Lunaria talking about the obvious demonic Word? Amelia hadn’t yet gone through a comprehensive list of Words with Serena. She’d wanted to, of course, but Serena had refused, claiming some Words were military secrets that she should not discuss with a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">civilian</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She also refused on the basis that if Amelia’s list turned out to be more comprehensive than what Serena knew, then it was information Serena could give up if she was ever captured.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWM2MzU3NWM0OTRjZGNhZTFhYThmNGQ5YzBjMjg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shaking her head, she decided to risk asking about </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">one </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Word. It was a Second-Word, but it seemed the most capable way to extinguish the fire. It would be a risk, as she’d never Spoken it before, but she was confident after </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she would have better control over herself and not become so… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">weird</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2UyZWZjMWM5MzQ5MzY5MWZmNjZmMmE0ZTgwODRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about…” Amelia kept her voice low, “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmM4ZmJmYjc2YTQ4ZWNiY2YzZTlkMzA3YjQ0OGRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> The demonic god of water.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOThkY2Q1OGU1YjQ0NjA5ZTIyOGIzYTBjY2M1MzVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” Lunaria replied, her eyes narrowing. “Even if such a communion was possible against his strength, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> hasn’t responded to any embodiments for nearly two centuries now. He no longer has an interest in this realm. We know that much.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmU5ZDI2YzNiNjQzNjc4MDEzOWNmNmZlMWM3ZWFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…” Amelia mumbled, dropping the subject. She was about to open her mouth when she sensed a powerful figure fly up from the black smoke. His black wings spread wide before he torpedoed towards the city's edge, landing heavily while coughing. His clothes were once fine; now, they were frayed, burnt, and covered in ash. His skin was patchy in places where he’d been burned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDBjOTdjYzM4MDRmMWFhZjU2YWJiYjMxNWY2NTNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This man had invoked </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Of that, Amelia was sure. His aura was a firm indigo, the telltale colour of the sixth aura level and the highest level achievable before needing to Speak the Second-Word.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDEyZjYwNDY2YjRmOWE4NWZkZWMxNjdjZGJhNTgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Highlord Yasuda!” shouted a nearby warrior guarding the firefighters. “What news!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzIwMDRiYWRmNTQ5N2JhMjdhZDk5ZGFkYjljMmJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s little use!” Yasuda yelled, gesturing towards the firehoses and orbs of magically-manifested water. “Save your aether!” He pointed at the nearby homes. “Soak every house between lift one to lift seven! Soak this trackway as well!” He stamped his foot against the wooden floorboards twice. “Spread the word! And tell the men to knock on every house within half a klick of the city's edge! The residents need to be ready to put out fires starting in their own homes! Give out sand buckets to them!” He pointed to the sky. “It’s only getting worse! The fire will lift burning debris all the way here! We cannot let this spread into Asamaywa Proper! Go! Now! Spread the message down the line!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjNiNGU3YTU5YjRmY2Q5ZmVjY2U5YzYwZjkxOGZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Highlord!” The warrior bowed as a moonstone narrowly missed his face. “You, you, and you! With me! Firefighters, save the water!” The man began diligently carrying out his duties.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzViZDhhZmRjYjQ2M2ZiZDBlMjYwYTNiNDQ1N2Rj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord Yasuda turned, stopping when he saw Amelia and everyone else.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDA2MDY5YjJhZjQ5MjNiYzRjMWUxNmFjOGI1YTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Inoue! Lord Halen! And…” He bowed. “Lord-Prospect Thornheart! Down below, the lowlanders speak prayers in your name! Have you come to offer healing? Hundreds will die without you!” His wings flapped, the motion somehow adding gravitas to his statement.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzYwNjIwODA1MjQ3ZThhNTE1NDliMzZjZDQ0NmM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A surge of emotion welled within Amelia. Sadness. Guilt. Fear. She pushed them down. She might not be able to save everyone, but she could heal those she could!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmZlNDdlOGQyZjRhYzc5NTUwMDdlMGYxYzU2MTFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!” Amelia said decisively. “I’ll be here for as long as I'm needed! Where should I go!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDUwYmNiYmY3ZTRmOTViOGJjNmU5YmVhMmY4ZDI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Into the heart of the inferno!” Yasuda shouted. “Fear not, an earthlord has managed to construct walls to protect an area! A handful of mages and a dozen warriors are trapped there while the fire burns, but their spirits burn stronger!” He clenched a fist. “They are still braving the flames to bring back the almost-dead! They risk their lives at every moment! Your divine intervention is needed! Will you go!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTcyNWI2MTExZjRhOWU5YWJlNjgyM2Y5MWI5Yjky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded frantically. “I will go!” she exclaimed. “Where are they trapped?” She peered over the edge, seeing nothing but billowing black smoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODNiMTE2NDY1MjRiOWNiYTFmMDIyZDk4ZWMyN2Rk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There!” he pointed down.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGNjNTljZTI3NjQzZjE5ODljMmE3YWMwNzMzMjg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia focused her perception and found she could identify the earthlord through the black smoke. Not from sight, but his signature in the aetherfield; the Speaker of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Salinas</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Nearby to him, she could sense the aether signatures of mages and warriors, but no other Speakers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGMwYjFjYjFiZTRjODBiZjJjMTIwNTZlMDVlODNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see it!” she yelled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTc4ZmJkMWE3YTQ0Y2U5ZTM5NmJhYTZkZmYzN2Fl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will go with her!” Serena declared. “My </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> will be of use.” She turned to face Mel. “Melanie Mori!” she commanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODg4NjhiNTMxMDQzMzJhYWRhYzExODYyYWNkOWRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Instructor Halen!?” Mel snapped to attention as if her body was reacting reflexively to Serena’s captain mode.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGRlMzg2MzY2YTRkYzU5NDQzYzRlNTJjZDQ4ZTE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come with me! With Amelia’s assistance, you can maintain that orange aura for as long as you need! You’ll help me rescue those from the inferno!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDY2MDgzOTRlYzQ0NzBhYzZhNjUyOTg0NjMwZDg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzgxNjg5MGM4NjQwNDQ4MzBhODhkMjQ0NTExMDUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunaria stepped forward. “Highlord Yasuda. Always a pleasure.” She smiled at the man. “How can this old woman help?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTMzNmQyNzNjMzQ3M2JhOThjNDVjYzRmNTgwYjE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Inoue.” Yasuda bowed quickly. “We are constructing earthworks below to the south. We must protect the station and the lifts! Your reserves of magic would be of tremendous help! The rocky terrain under the station is making things difficult!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzhhY2Y4NzMyOTRmYTJiODIyM2QxNGNlMTI4YThj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well then,” Lunaria’s eyes glinted. “Miss Aikawa, with me! We shall leave immediately!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2ZkY2I3NTY0NzQyOGQ4MjBiODBhNWE1NzdmYzAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Head Instructor!” Hinako affirmed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDk4ZTgyMzU0NzQzMzFhYTg4Mjk0ZTE4YmFmNDlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong><em>Igni,</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400">” Lunaria Spoke. The ground under her feet cracked slightly as wings of hellfire formed on her back. Without another word, she picked Hinako up and flew to the south. The Spoken Word prompted the mages nearby to stop wetting the houses and look on in awe. It wasn’t every day they would see a Speaker Speak, and even rarer to see one do so more or less </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">silently</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. A chorus of murmurs reached Amelia’s ears.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2U0OTM4YzIxZDQ2NjhiMTg0OTc5YzQwNmRiNjU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you see that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzFkZjNhZjMzNjRjMjNiYTdmYzBlOWY1ZTliYmQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was Lord Inoue, wasn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDdkNDJiMWM3ZDQwYTE4NTg1MWNlYjRlNmEyMTBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They call her the Aether Addict…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWI3NzIzMDRlNTQzNzk4MjgzNzYxMzc5ZDA1OGNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be distracted! Back to work!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGNkOTAyMjI0YzQ0NWZhNWUzMjFiNDg1OWEwNGI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord Yasuda turned back towards Amelia, Serena, and Mel. “I will-” He suddenly coughed, and Amelia realised he’d likely been inhaling smoke for a while now. Without asking, she sent forth a burst of healing magic, then another burst of cleaning magic.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTU0NTViNjMwYTQ5ZTFhYTJkYjBmZmJhMGM1NTZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…” The demon looked at his clothes. “I thank you, Healer Thornheart! My aura feels strong again! You’ve reinvigorated my hope!” He gave her a firm nod. “I shall give you two space to Speak. I shall see you down there!” He went to flap his wings.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTIzYTgyNWI5NDQzOTI4NmZmZjcyNGVhY2UwNTc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait!” Amelia piped up. “Let me ward you first!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjRiNjFmNDAyYzQxMWFiYTlmY2VmZjU0MzBmYzA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the capabilities of a warrior's aura, especially one of Yasuda’s level, the man had been struggling after being exposed to such intense heat for so long. Amelia twisted her aether, willing it to form into the familiar shape of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni’s Barrier</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was only a first-circle spell, but it had strong fire resistance, which, when backed by Amelia’s titanic amounts of aether, would be boosted even further.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzIwNTI2NTZlYjQwYWNiZjlkODNlYTg5MTMwZjNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She cast the ward on Yasuda and then followed up by protecting Mel as well. For Mel, she also cast the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ward of Thew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, enhancing her capabilities across the board. Her friend was only capable of orange aura, and Amelia wanted to minimise the risk she would face in the fire.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzgxNzc0NmZiNjQ3NGI5MGE5N2U3YWRjZGIyMGMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She wouldn’t let any of her friends die.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2VkZWY1YjdhYjQyMzFhNWYzZmE3NmQyZDg0NzE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">To his credit, Yasuda recovered from his shock quickly. Externally cast and maintained wards were not common; this might have been the first time it happened to him. Nevertheless, he thanked her quickly. “Then, I shall take the warrior Melanie Mori,” he declared. “Lord Halen, Lord-Prospect, follow my aether signature after you’ve Spoken!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjgyZGQ1NzcwZTQ4NWRiMzdlYTA5NGUyMzU4MTRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Highlord!” Serena and Amelia echoed. Mel tried to say something, but Yasuda wasted no time picking her up and carrying her down into the black smoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDc3ODg5ZWZmYjQxZmFiNDBkZmQzODI5ZTUwNzM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She wasn’t sure, but Amelia thought she saw a blush on Mel’s cheek.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNThmN2E1NjZhMTQ5YjY5NDlmNWRhNWNjYzJmMWQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">How scandalous!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODJlZGU5ZDdhMDQ2MDI4NzU3ZjdjZjc1NDMxMjQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can Speak silently,” Serena muttered. “I can’t. I’ll jump and Speak mid-air. I have enough power under </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to guide my fall. I’ll go first.” Serena backed up, and without another word, she launched herself towards the oppressive mass of black smoke and its underlying inferno.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDJhYzFhZDAyZjRkYjBhNjQ0YzNjMjJlM2QyMTRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong><em>Narean,</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400">” Serena Spoke as she fell. The force of her Word was explosive, pushing away a large section of the smoke and blasting Amelia with enough force to make her step back. If Serena had Spoken up here, she would probably have destroyed a house or two!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDBjY2Y2MjE1NjRjNWI5ODhkYzY1YzkxZWE5MzMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia swallowed. She peered over the ledge, glad to see Serena descending slowly towards the destination. Her horns were ignited with hellfire, and a tail made of the same ethereal fire stretched from the base of her spine. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmNhN2QyYTIyNDQxNzY5ODFjMzY2YTg0MDY5ODdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? What was that? Amelia peered closer. Usually, Serena had only a shadow of black wings, barely visible to the naked eye. Now, it was half-manifested!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmQ1ZWI2MmY4OTQ1YjI4OTMzYzZjMjk2YmY1MjQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her girlfriend was getting more powerful!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjVhNzQ0MjI0NzQ0YTM5NTBhNDUyY2Q2ZGNkMGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, it was just Amelia. She took a deep breath, expelling the aether from her body.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODllYzg1MmIxNjQ4OWQ5MjU0YjhhYWMyOTBlNWM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong><em>Aseco,</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400">” she Spoke, feeling the exhilarating thrill as power erupted within her body. The divine aether immediately made her feel her capabilities magnify by at least a magnitude. Perhaps even more. Under </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia glowed with golden light, brightening the area for fifty meters. The nearby mages were gawking at her, too surprised to say anything.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODg4NjNmNTM5MTRmNWI5NzdkODgyNTZkZjQ2NDBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia didn’t jump; she simply used her aether to will her body to lift and fly. Her connection with the aetherfield was strong, and she could now push her aether against not only the lumina kilometres below but also the aetherfield itself. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGNlZDVkZTVmNTQzODc4NzNkZTYyNDkyN2VlZDRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Effectively, she could fly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTU4N2JjOGMyYzQyMzQ5OWZkODZmMTI5N2I4YTZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And so she did. Amelia tore through the sky, racing down through the darkness towards the signatures of the Speakers below. For a moment, she wondered if she looked like a yellow moonstone falling to the ground. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmNiYzQyMzkxODRlZGJhMTQ4ZmU1ZGY2MjNkNzQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She took the opportunity of being airborne to stretch her senses. There were numerous Speakers in the distance, around the edges of the inferno, especially towards the train station to the south. One exceptionally bright spot in her perception was easily recognisable as Lunaria. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmQyNjA1MWJmNzQyMjU4MDdiNzRkNjc1NWJhYmUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, most of them seemed to be warriors. While a Speaker warrior was a huge help, it wasn’t like a sword could cut down this inferno. Amelia sent a quick expression of gratitude to her past self for picking a mage in the game. This way, she could have a much greater effect on the world. A positive effect!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDhjNzJjNTMwNjQ2NjZiNzAyMmYwZThlNTg4NWQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia burst through the darkness, flaring her aether to stop herself from crashing into the ground embarrassingly. She landed gently, looking around.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWU2ZDg1N2M1YjQyMGQ4NWExZjQ1NGIzNTUwMzJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Familiar</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2I1OTg1Mzk5NTQzNDFhY2NjZjI1ZTcwOWJhZjkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the same square they’d passed through on the way to the orphanage. Yes. There was the guardhouse, now used as a makeshift hospital and space to hide from the moon rain. There was the derelict fountain, now full of water due to the nearby mages keeping it topped up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTA2MTk3N2NhYTRkYzI5OTVlOWRlZjk5NDQ1OGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She could hear the cries of pain and fear from inside the guardhouse. Not just a few voices but dozens and dozens. There were… even a few bodies in the square, now buried under ash and dust. Had they died from the moonrain as they fled the fire?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGU4YWI3MDA5YTQzZTA4MGE0MWFmOTMzZDBkYTk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, there were no children among them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWVlMDIyYzJmMDQ1ZWRiYjkzODZhZmZhMWY0OGNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia mentally slapped herself. Now wasn’t the time to ruminate! Focus on the situation!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDk1ZTdhZjM0ZjRjMWI4NDBmNzA1MmZmNjUwZDQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The square was enclosed by enormous earthen walls over ten meters high. A demon who looked like his skin was made of rock was maintaining the walls, continuously reinforcing them against the relentless heat outside. The earthlord had also built shelters which a few cowering people were using for protection, their faces painted in exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDBkYzBhMWM4MDQ2MDliYWZmNWRhOTM0NmNmMDcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord Yasuda, Serena, and Mel were gathered nearby, watching her in anticipation. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDBhZmU0YTM2YTQ2YzQ4YjcyZjUwMmUwYTBmYmY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena gave her a nod.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmNmYmVhNWJjYjQzZWQ4ODJjODM0MmUzODMzZDBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time to work.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWYzOGVkYzVlOTQyNzA4MDJlZDAyOTk1MTZlNTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Getting started!” she declared, spooling up her aether and forming it into her chosen spell. She poured more and more divine aether into it until she was confident it would produce the desired result. She could cast this level of magic silently, but she vocalised it for the sake of those near.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWY4YmE4ZmUyNzQ0MTA5YzFiZGJiNzRmYjU2ZmEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fourth circle,” she intoned. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavenly Mending!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODRiMmFkMzQxNTRkYTk4OTRmNjlmNzk3ZGFmYWE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Golden and blue ribbons of light exploded from her. There were hundreds and hundreds of them. Ribbons of healing flew out; a dozen went into mages and warriors working in the square. A hundred or so went into the hospital, and the rest flew out, passing through the earthern walls and into the inferno.</span></p><span class="cjhjZTY5NDczMjc5ODRjYzc4YmQ2NmJhNTM2MTFmODQw"><br/>Stolen content alert: this content belongs on Royal Road.

<p class="cnNlYzEwM2VlZTA2MTQ4ZjdhMTE5NDRhOTNjNWM3NTBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t long before jubilant cries sounded from the previously injured.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDcyMThmMTVkNzRhNWFiNDk3NmFmMTU5OGJkN2Ji" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I can see again!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmFmODJmYjIwODRlZTFhNmRkZjM1OTJhMmQwZDAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My daughter! She’s recovered!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODYzZTZkYzExNjRmM2U5NzExZWU2MDJjM2E1YjZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ma… what happened?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTg0MzFiNzdlYzQ3YTliMWYyZGQyY2NkYmJkMTU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The exhaustion… it’s gone!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGJmYTU4YzBmYzQ3NDhhMTMwNzA1MTFiNWMwYjg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia wasn’t done yet.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWM1ZmE4MGExYTRiOTNhMGNmM2Y4ODRmZmQ4NmUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fifth circle,” she said, forming another spell and pouring even more aether into it. She wanted the bounds of this spell to be far greater than her invocation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Divine Healing of Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> earlier that day. She needed this one to cover the entire slums and all those working to protect it. She poured more and more aether into the formation - more than she’d ever committed into a single spell under the First-Word. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODBiYzBlZjMyNTQ0ZjZhZDhkMmZmNzk4OTdjZDRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sphere of Convalescence!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” she announced, activating the formation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDI5MTg5MzU1ZjQ0M2NhMDZmYjE1YzE2ZTFiMjEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A bubble of golden light expanded from her, first encompassing the square, then continuing to pass through the earthlord defences and out into the inferno. Amelia felt it expand further and further, until it reached the target distance of nearly a kilometer in diameter.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDI3NGY2NzhkYjQ2Yzg5MjFjMmU2MWMwNmJjZWI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Such unbelievable aether cost! </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDA5NmRiNDg1NDRkZmQ5MTVmNmZjNzM1MzZlZDBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia had never felt stretched for aether before, but now she was painfully aware of the cost of maintaining such a sizeable area-of-effect healing spell. The aether cost was proportional to the volume of the sphere, and the volume of a sphere doubles every time the radius is increased by twenty-six per cent. She’d pushed the spell far further than she’d ever seen anyone do in the game. That volume added up, and maintaining the bubble as it was right now used up more than </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">half</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Amelia’s aether.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjFkOTM2Yjk0YTRmOWQ5N2MwMGU1MWEyZDljOGE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">How much aether was she using right now? More than a hundred normal mages? More than two hundred?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzcwMjhmZTc4ODQ2MTQ4MDQ3N2JkOWE5OGY0ZTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Strangely, using such a large amount of her aether was exhilarating. Amelia felt </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">good</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was as if the aether </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wanted</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be used, and she was being rewarded with dopamine for doing so! Deep down, she could feel the need to use even more. It was a strange desire, but thankfully, it wasn’t as bad as the mania she was in under the influence of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjQ4NThjNjBlNTQ0OWZhNmE3MGFmMGZiZDIyZTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve cast a field spell!” Amelia announced to the warriors. “It’s a constant healing spell that works on everyone in its radius! It should be enough to stop smoke inhalation from stopping you! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This…</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” She cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavenly Mending</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> again; this time, a little over two hundred ribbons flew out. “Is healing magic that automatically targets those who need it! If you follow the ribbons, they will take you to someone injured or who keeps getting injured!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDA5Nzg2N2M1MjQ1MzZhN2YwMGZkZjgwOWE4OWJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Igni’s Barrier</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> on any warriors! It will help greatly against the fire! Come to me!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2VlOGY1MjI5ODQ0Mjc5YTU1ZGIzOWE5MmY3MGU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The half dozen warriors she’d never seen before accepted her spellwork with looks of appreciation and gratitude. They examined their bodies, which had begun to glow with a magical red light more ethereal than the red hues of red aura.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGRlNDFiOGEwNzRmZGI4MjlmNmY2MDQ2MTI0ZThk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You heard her!” Highlord Yasuda barked, shocking the surrounding warriors into action. They ran to the walls, where the reinvigorated earthlord made openings for them. The warriors carried coats and blankets soaked in the fountain water, presumably to cover anyone they found and carry them back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTgwYWE1YjcyOTQ5ZWRhNTMyNGQ3NDdhNTdhYmVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t want to think about the chance that someone might be getting burnt alive, only to be healed and made to suffer even more while they waited to be rescued. She tried her best to instinctively command her aether to ease the pain receptors of those it healed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWExZTkzNjFjODRjY2ZiZTc0MTA1MjIwZmU3YTE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re amazing,” Serena whispered, pulling Amelia into a quick hug. “I’ll be back!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjk0OGMzYTFmNTRiYjRiZTk0NjgxMDcyYjZhY2Fk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you will!” Amelia replied with a smile. “Follow the ribbons! Both of you!” she gave Serena and Mel an enthusiastic thumbs up and told them to hurry up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2U3ZTFlODI5MjQxZWViMDhjM2Q0NmE4ZjFlMzM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once they had left, Highlord Yasuda gave her a deep bow. “Truly, you are becoming a Saint before my very eyes, Lord-Prospect.” Before Amelia could answer, he continued, “Now, I must return to Greatlord Oshiro and coordinate the efforts near the lifts. I will mention your deed to him!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWVmYWU3MTY1MzQwMDQ4M2VlOWY2MGY3MzVkOWMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm! Thank you!” Amelia chirped. “My </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sphere of Convalescence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> should cover even the station itself, so if you bring any injured within range, it will greatly aid their recovery!” According to the lore of the game, as long as someone was still alive when brought into the healing sphere, they would eventually make a full recovery, even if it took longer than </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> normal divine healing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzc0ZGRjMjMwNTRkNzZiMWI0Y2ViY2Q2ZjEwNjk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your generosity will not go unrewarded! I promise this, on my name and honour!” Yasuda declared, flapping his wings and soaring to the sky. Through the aetherfield, Amelia watched him travel to the south. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTFmMGExZGU3MzQ0Y2NiZTg0ZjljNGM0ODExNDJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She spent the next few minutes keeping track of the warriors through her aetherflows, making sure their wards were strong and that none of them had stopped moving. She couldn’t do much other than wait and pump out aether. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTEwZWIyNDA4NTQ2YWRhYWQ1MzVmZTU0YzJjMTgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, they started to return, carrying crying men, women, and children. Amelia was told the citizens were hiding in basements and wells, desperately trying to escape the inferno that consumed the homes above them. They had all been healed recently, but some carried burns gained from just the short trip to the square. Amelia quickly healed those with a targeted cast of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Divine Healing of Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWE1MjkyNjA3ODQxZTI5ZjA3MDhjYzlhNjBkYzdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time a handful of warriors returned, Amelia would cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavenly Mending</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> again, and the warriors would race out, following the ribbons of healing to their targets. Every time she cast the spell, fewer ribbons would manifest. This was the best she could hope for, as it meant the amount of people still getting hurt was reducing. The spell wouldn’t reveal anyone who wasn’t injured, but the keen senses of the aura and ward-enhanced warriors made it easy to find them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2U5NzMwNjU0NDQ3ZTc5NmI5NWU3ZTYyMzg0ZDA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How bad is it out there?” Amelia asked Serena when she returned from one run with a particularly grim expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDRkY2NhZDY3NjRlMjFhYTRiZjM3ZjZlMzYzZDRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Bad. Bodies burned beyond recognition,” Serena answered. “The smell is… unpleasant.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjk3MGZjNTFhYzQyZWNiZGYzNTYwNzI1NjgwMmE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah,” Amelia uttered. She cleaned her girlfriend with healing magic, wiping the sweat and ash. It would only keep her clean for a few seconds, but it gave her something else to do than just sit there and pump out aether.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmIxYmRjZDRmYTRkYzliMTkyOGRjYTY5NDJlY2Y2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After another cast of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavenly Mending</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena ran off.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2Y1ZjIzZjZkNjRmYjY4Mjc4OWM2YmE2MzAwNTli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">An hour passed like this.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTM2NWI4YTRhZjQzN2E4OWNhYTA2NmEyNzU1YTUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Over time, the freshly-healed had started to gather at the entrance of the guardhouse. They watched Amelia with reverence and awe, muttering prayers of gratitude.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGFiMWI2NjJmMTQ0OGM4MjIyMDQ2Y2JmZDIxMGU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Praise the Empress for sending her to us!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWY4MDMzZmVkNDQ2ZTM5MGVlYWIyOWQ2MmM2NWJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Moons have blessed us!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzEwNWY0Y2ZhODRmMTFhNGZhNGRjYTZiYjk5OGM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s as radiant as the Yellow Moon!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTM2NDVjYWExZDRmYjJiZDk1NWQyMDViNDQ4NzJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My child lives because of her!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWU5M2VkYTEzMzQ5NzE4MmE3NDQ5OWFhYmRjYjdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia swallowed nervously as she heard these. A part of her was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so happy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be able to make such a positive difference, but another part of her was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">angry</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that it had to be done in the first place. Why did these people have to suffer this cruelty? What did they do to deserve it?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDk0ZmE5NWRjYjRjYjZhM2UyNjM4M2Y4YTQ0YmI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And how did the fire start?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGFlY2ZmN2IzNzQ5MzFiMjAzOWZlOTQ0YTYwYmJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She pushed those thoughts down, focusing on maintaining her spells. She cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavenly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mending</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> again, pleased to see only two ribbons fly from her body, meaning only two injured people were left in the fire. Mel, covered in ash and stains, brought back one of them, and another warrior she didn’t know the name of got the other. Serena soon appeared with a third. It was someone who wasn’t injured yet was rescued anyway.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGY0YTI3MWY5ZTQ4OGNhMjgwYzBlNTFhOWZhZjU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The rest are refusing to leave their basements,” a warrior said as the group gathered around Amelia for a short respite. “They won’t risk the fire. They might be okay staying where they are. I think we’ve saved everyone that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">needs</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be saved.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODVhZTc4NTc1NjQ3NDlhODFmNTJmMTE3OTNkNmI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” Serena agreed. “I’m not hearing any cries anymore, and even though the fire keeps spreading, it looks like everyone else was able to evacuate in time.” She looked up. “At least the moonrain has stopped. People will be able to come out of their homes and help. All these people have lost their homes; they need food and shelter. It’s winter, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2UxMGZhMDQ0NTRiNWZhOWI5YzFkMmI5MjVlMzY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hang on! Did you say the fire is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">still </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spreading!?” Amelia felt her eyes widen. They hadn’t got it under control!?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmE5YTA2NjE0MTQzMWI5NWEwNDI1NzQ0OTk4Yjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know the details,” Serena explained. “I’m only relying on my senses, but it seems to be spreading.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWVlYjQyYzg1YjRhNTdhZDE5MzhiYTNhZDZjZWQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere grew sombre.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTBiODBmMGViNTRhMzM4N2ZjNDE3NTI2MGRkMzU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavenly Mending</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> once more; this time, a single ribbon manifested, flying straight up into the sky.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmFmODU2MGE4YzRmZWRiMzU0MDBlYjhlOWFhZDU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Where it slammed into a figure that was flying down to meet them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDE5MzIwMWVkNTQ2OTdhNDYyYjE3NmJkNzEyZTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord!” The group exclaimed, bowing deeply.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2M5ZDY4OTI0ZjQ5M2Y5MDFmY2ExMWI3YzZiMTk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One of the most unexpected but pleasant greetings I’ve experienced in a long time, Lord-Prospect Thornheart,” Greatlord Oshiro intoned, landing. Judging from the scales on his arms, he was under an invocation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Bayle</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the same Word Korvus Spoke all those months ago. “Although,” he continued, “Perhaps I should begin calling you what the lowlanders have begun to call you? </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lady Thornheart of the Lowlands</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjY0ZTU2YTJjMjRiNmNhNzAyMTU4YTU2YWU4YjY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no need, Greatlord,” Amelia muttered, trying to smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Nzc4NWI0ZGVjMDQ2ZWZiOGRjZTdmOTBlMWQxODAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve been busy coordinating my Highlords, but I see Yasuda has given you some guidance,” he looked around the group and beyond, taking in the hundreds of healthy men, women and children. “Lord Halen, your report?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDAxMWNmMWM2ZTRiYzg4ODJjNmE2OWI3ZWMwM2Ri" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Greatlord!” Serena saluted before giving Greatlord Oshiro a rundown of their work.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGYyYWE0YWEzODRmNGRhODhmYWNiNTcyZjkxNWMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then we’ve saved who we can,” he said while nodding. “Stay here until the fire burns out. Keep this group safe. Lord-Prospect Thornheart, can you maintain this… healing field for much longer?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDM2ZWEwNDdhNjRiMzhiOGM0NzUyZjZkMTJkNzc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As long as you need, Greatlord,” Amelia answered. She wasn’t bragging, just stating the truth. However, it didn’t stop a few people from murmuring the word </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">saint</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. “Are you sure I’m not needed elsewhere? Isn’t the fire still spreading?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjAyZWFlMzJmNjQ4Nzk5OWQwODc5MTk5ZWY5NTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is, but we’ve focused on protecting the plateau lifts. We’ve evacuated who we need. There is no choice but to let it burn itself out.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTJkMjI5Zjg0YTQ2OTc4YjBiYzVhZGYzMTdhMGJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The station?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWUxMjE2MzFiMzQzYjRiZGMzMzI5ODQ0YTc1YzVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The greatlord’s expression darkened. “It will be lost. We cannot contend against the southerly wind. The station is too large, and the terrain is too disadvantageous for them to work. Too much rock underfoot to build high enough walls.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjQ4YWVjMDdlNDQ5N2ZhNzc2OGIwMGQ2MjYxNTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia swallowed. She knew enough to understand that the Asamaywa Station was the biggest rail hub in the East, carrying people and connecting the industries of multiple cities. How much would be lost? The cost would be millions of denarii, if not tens of millions!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2IyMzY0YWUzODRiNmViZmFiNDdjMmJkYWFmMTUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s mind raced.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODM3MWVjMjc0ZjQ2ZWJiMmY1ZmI3NDIyNWMwZjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Should she?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDc0ZWFkN2ZhZjQxNGZhNjkyNzBlNjE5MDM5YTc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She should, shouldn’t she?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODY1NDdkMTA2ZTQ4Y2RiMmRmNTgwODk0YTNmMDk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back, Chesterfield had indicated that she would be welcome to speak </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">one or two</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> demonic Words at the academy. He suggested this would play into the international politics they were engaged in with the human nations.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDY0N2Y1NjkzZTRiOTlhNzBlYzg2OThhMjM0ZjA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But… he didn’t place any restrictions on whether they were First-Words or Second-Words, did he? And… even if she was planning to stretch his words a little, Amelia was her own person. She’d made the decision after healing the slums; she wouldn’t let petty politics stop her from preventing so much suffering!</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDRmMzg4OWM3ZjRkNzFhZmUyZThmMGNjMWM5NTM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord,” Amelia said, turning the man's attention to her. “Lord Halen,” she continued, also taking Serena’s attention. “A moment… in private?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWRlZmQ1NzNjNjQ3Zjg4ZGU4M2I1YTFkMWY1MjI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few awkward moments later, the three of them moved to the side, encompassed by Amelia’s sound-blocking wards.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWRjZTNlMDgxYTQwNWQ4YjQyMGEyZDJmYmU4MjMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that we’ve saved those that we can save…” she began nervously, looking between Serena and the Greatlord. “If there was a way to put the fire out, should we not take it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTE4NGEyZGJmYzQxN2U5NjY3ZDEwZmE5MWQ1ZGM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re talking about invoking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, I cannot allow it,” Greatlord Oshiro replied. “Besides, my understanding of that god is it wouldn’t be suited for such a task. What would you attempt to do? </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Heal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the buildings back together? Is such a thing possible?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjliN2E5YjMzYzQwZDVhYzU3YTZjNzZmYzRlMGMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was such a thing possible? Now he mentioned it, Amelia thought it might be likely. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">’s healing was more about </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">restoring order</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> than </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">repairing injuries</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Would it be able to unburn wood and reconstruct destroyed buildings?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGI1NmUxYjI0NzRiMzA5NGNlZjhlM2U2MzE4Nzdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it could, but that wasn’t what Amelia planned to suggest.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGVhMTk5OGZlNTQzOGRiYzMwM2YxNTAzYmI4MDE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually,” she was getting nervous now. “I was going to suggest I try another Word.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjczZWFjODMwNzQyNTFiYjZjZTI3NjZkNjM3Nzhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Yemaya?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” he asked, frowning.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2ZmZWJjYTg1MjQ3Mzg5Zjg4NmExYmNjNDJlZGIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Amelia shook her head. “I mean…” She sighed. She might as well come out and say it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjFkNWY4MWIxMjRiYTA5OGYwOTY0ZTQ2N2RjMmM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” she declared, trying to sound confident.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2I3YWE5YWY2YTRlZDM4NGE0ZDVmYzc5Y2RjM2Vm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A long silence developed between the three of them. With every passing second, Greatlord Oshiro’s expression darkened further.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjAxN2YyNTNhMDQxMjNhZjY3NzQ4NmFjN2NkODlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You lie,” he finally said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTYzNGNhYzVmYjQ2NDU5NjZkNjEzYTY2OGMxYTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not,” Amelia said, her protest sounding weaker than she hoped. “I just-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDFkNDdkNjc4YTQ4MDI4YTFiNTU4Y2VmZDAyOTU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is not possible.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDAxOWQxZjBhMzRmOTlhYzI0ZWZmMDY2NTNiZWFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord…” Serena interrupted, speaking quietly and softly. Her girlfriend turned the Greatlord’s attention upon herself, and instead of withering from his darkened expression, she faced him with confidence. “If it’s her… it is possible.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDY0ZjdmYmI1YjQ3Yzc5YjVlNzJhYjhhOTg2N2Jk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The man was deathly quiet. For a moment, Amelia thought he would never reply, but he eventually responded with a simple, “How?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2YwMDQzNDQxYjQ1YjhhMDNjZDI3Zjk2ZjUxMWIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t fully understand it myself,” Serena replied, her voice even. “I just know… she could call upon him. With your permission, of course, Greatlord.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWExN2VlMDdhODRjNGZhZjVmNTlmZmIyYTRlZDkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord Oshiro turned towards Amelia. He stepped forward with an expression she’d never seen him wear before. “Tell me!” he demanded. “Who are you, really!? The Overlord of my Overlord!? Are you the one I pray to!? The one I fight for? Answer me! If you are not </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, then </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">who are you!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjlkMjZhNTFiYTQ3MDJhYWQxMjNmMDMxN2IwYWJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I’m not!” Amelia spluttered, putting her hands up. “I’m not! I’m only me! Amelia!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2YxYjMzYTlhMTRhZGFiOWU1YTljOWY1MjlkMzY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The greatlord glared at her for a dozen seconds. Amelia couldn’t begin to guess his thoughts. How could she? She felt guilt for causing him such turmoil, but… she only wanted to help!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Yjg2YWY2M2ZhNTQzOWQ5NzlmNmQ2NDZlNmYwNTM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk! Then I will see this power for myself!” Greatlord Oshiro suddenly declared, all traces of conflict in his face evaporating. “You have my permission, Lord-Prospect Thornheart. Invoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, and I shall be the judge of your sincerity.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDI1ZjNkYWQxMzQ4OGJiOGE0ZTU1YjJkMzQ1ZWU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is… is it okay?” Amelia asked hesitantly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmUyZDAyZjU0YjQ5NDg4NzU4YzY2YjE3Y2NmN2Rk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGIxY2E3OWYwNzQ4YjE4NWZhMDY3ZjJiOGQ5NTAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia looked towards Serena, who gave her a small smile and a nod. “Save that station,” her girlfriend said encouragingly. Somehow, despite the pressure and unease from Greatlord Oshiro, Serena’s small smile brought back all of Amelia’s confidence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTM0N2IwNjNlYjRiOGM4ODllNjAyNmI3ODQxYzdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure!” Amelia nodded. “Only… I cannot guarantee I won’t become a little…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTU5NWExOWIwMTQ3Njk5NmU2NzdiOTk1NTg3MGE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Manic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I need to find a better word</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWU3MDkyYmRhNDRjN2ViOGE0MWZiMzZkNDhkOWIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Manic,” Serena explained to the greatlord. “She’s still new to invoking the Second-Word. I had to spend time calming her when she invoked </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjNjZjNlYzNjYTRhYTA4M2MzN2JjMDNkZjk5MzVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...I see.” Greatlord Oshiro took a step back and drew his sword. “Very well then. Then here I take this vow.” He covered his sword in a brilliant indigo aura before driving it into the stone. “Should you lose control of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, then I…” He narrowed his eyes, his clothes billowing under some unseen wind as the ash was stirred up around him. “...I, Takahiro Oshiro, shall suppress you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzlhZWRiNzJmOTQ3YTliZDgzY2VhZDc1ZjIzOTMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia swallowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmEzNTQ3MTA5NDQ2M2VhODlkOWM5ZjgzNmQ4MDlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was so cool! So ridiculously cool!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDZiZTkwYzkyYjQxMTA5NTI2YTI3ZDkxMDZhZTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will help,” Serena added, her voice firm. “I will bring you back, no matter what.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzQxZGRiYjI0YzQxMmI5OWQwOTJjOTg4MjVjZmI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-thank you!” Amelia said, pushing away the urge to giggle. “Then… I’ll go up a little and, um, begin…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzI0MjFkN2FmMjRmMWViMTg2ZDYyMzkyOWExYzhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She took a few steps back and, feeling tremendously awkward, cycled her aether to float up above. When she reached the height of the earthen wall, she began forming the Word.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjFhYmQ5ODZjNDQxZTI4YjI2OGU0MzEzZDM2OTMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyZTZlMmFmZjZmMTQ5Zjc4NmYwYzFhMjE2MWI0YmY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was slow progress, slower than it took with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Her aether was moving like it was pushing through sludge.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjFkODczZWQ3YTRiZTliYzNjNzZhMDdhNTVkMTAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">moving. It </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">forming the Word. Without question or doubt in her mind, Amelia knew this; she was capable of calling for his embodiment.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODM3MDcwZWE5YzQ4M2FiMjFlNjhhNmM4Yjg0MjEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A minute passed, and it was finally complete. It was an enormous Word; the formation was even more complex than </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It took up her entire body, so much space that she had to drop the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sphere of Convalescence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTUyNTZkOGIxNDQ5MjI4NGFlNDljNzY4Y2VjNDQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was finished.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmE4YmJkMWMwYjQ5ZjA5OTVjNzg0NWFkMGFlOGEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And it felt oddly familiar.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjQ2YTczM2IwOTQzODViN2M3ZGI5NTAyNmVhMDgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it because it was a demonic Word? Because she was a demon in the game?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDQxYWY1NjY1ZTQyZTBiNDhjODU3Y2RhY2ZhOGRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She cast one final look at Serena, gave her a small wave and said softly, “See you in a bit.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzdlMjBkMjBiNTQ1NTRhOGExYTQ5ZmJkNmE2M2M3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She Spoke the Word. She didn’t shout it like she did with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjY4YWM0MWE5MTRlNDk5YjY2ZWY3ODE2NzljZjg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No. She just said it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTMyN2JjZTQwMTQ4YzNiNGE3OGQwNjhiMjkwZjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong><em>Suijin</em></strong><strong>,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Spoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGU5OWFkOGI2YjQ0YWI4ZWVkMjc1ZjA3MWMzY2Zk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The world slowed. The Shimmer opened to her, and her request snaked through the layered planes of reality, seeking its distant recipient.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmI3OTdiMjg3YjRlYmNiNmIzNTc3YWUwOTExNmJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It hit resistance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmM2MGU1NTgxMjQ0MjU4MzQyOTA1MDg3NTBhMjMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s request didn’t give up. It fought. It burrowed its way through the resistance until the pathway was clear, and it could finally deliver the request to the waiting deity. Then, without warning, the answer came.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzA5MmZhYjU2YTRjYmI4NDc1YzI4NzlmOWFkZWEz" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong>Who dares?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">” Suijin replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGFhOWIwNDFlYTRkNzRhMzdmMTRiMDNlYWYyNDYy"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMmM3M2UwMTI4MTRkMGNiZjRmYjQxNzgwZGZmNzhi"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Suijin POV" height="66" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/suijin.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="660"/></span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjg0MzFiODRjMDQyY2M5ODIxY2E4MjJhZjBmOTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin swam through the endless ocean. This planet was his favourite, mainly because he was rarely bothered by his peers here. He had peace, and while enjoying that peace, Suijin kept swimming. He changed his form as he went, switching from small fish to massive sea-born predators pulled from thousands of memories.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTZlZjdkZDYzMTQxZTU4NjI0NTA0ZjJmZjc3ZDNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he changed his form to water itself, merging with the planet's natural currents. He let nature take its course, bringing him to the frigid poles and then back down to the warm waters around the equator. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmVkODU1NGIwZDQyMmE4MzIyODNlZmI5NmM2MzQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Some small tropical landmasses offered sandy beaches and delicious fruits. Every few years, he would make landfall, but there wouldn’t be many rotations of the planet about its axis before he felt the pull of the water again.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzdiYzM0YzQ1NjQ1OWFhMmIxNGE1NmQxMGZkNmY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the water, he could resonate more easily with the mists.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjZiZmM1ZTg4YTQzZWM5NDkwNmIyMzZjYWFiZGYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the water, he could get stronger.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjhkNDliN2NiZDRmOGRiOTBiNjQ4YmVhMTRhZDEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And Suijin desired strength.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjFiYjdkMjU2MzRlYzY5Y2MxNmNiYjE3ZmEzOWY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As all gods did.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjliZDZhNmZjYzQ1ZjJhNTlmNWRlYjFhYjlmOGMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After his third trip around the planet, his divine intuition told him something was coming.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmQ3MDA0ZWJjODQ5NTk4M2QzYzFlYjkwMTAzMDkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">A visitor?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkYjEzOGY4YTM5MDQ0MDZiMzUxYmRiMDhkM2U0Nzhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin pulled his mass together and headed to the nearest landmass. He forced his body to change until it resembled the form he possessed before he ascended.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmM3NjRkM2Y2YTQwNjhhMTA1MGZjNGZmNTgxNDgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He sat on the sandy beach, awaiting his visitor.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODZjOGZkYjYxYzQ4MDk5MDM1MGNlZDY2NGE3ZGZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Strangely, they were coming from an unusual place. Did he not know this deity?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzNhMGFkM2ZhZjQ3YzdiYmVjNGU0NmJhNDAyNmRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As they got closer, he realised an awful truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjU4MzA3NGY1MTRlMTFhNjU2MmU5ZjI3NDBhYTdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">they</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">; it was an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">it</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDY3MDgwODM4OTQwNmVhNzI5OGI5OWMwMDdkNDEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">it</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was a request.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGFkNDZlMDg3MjQyYTVhNTcyM2I2MzdlNjU1ODJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A request for his embodiment!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTc3NDM2Mzc1ZjQ0MGFhZDgxZWIzOTdmY2JiNTkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Who would have the audacity!?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjJkMzVjYmRmMzQ1YjU5ZTc2ZjFhY2Q2MjBiYjc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">No, who would have the means?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNmOTcyNGJmYjFmMDRlMWQ4OTJmNTQ3NTIzYWM5NzA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He had abandoned such things long ago. Raising a hand, he expelled some of his divinity, throwing a shield around the planet.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTNjYTdlMWQ3NjQyZDlhYWUzOWYxZGU0ZDc0YjVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The request slammed into it with an unfathomable amount of force. His celestial ward held. For a brief moment, Suijin thought that would be the end of it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjdiMmI3YTQxNzQ1ZjQ5MjBkNzZjMmFmY2RkMmIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the request continued. Slowly but surely, it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">burrowed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> through his protection.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDRiNjYyMDQyMTRmZTQ4YmVlNjNhNzQ4NThkY2Y4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The god gritted his teeth. Who, from that realm, had such power!? He was bound by the accord, unable to use his true strength to fight what he had previously agreed to. Still, for two centuries, it had been enough. He had withdrawn his presence from that world, refusing to commune with anyone else.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDU3N2Q2ZDgxNTQxNzBiMzk2ODQ2NTJiYWQ5Mjlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Staying there was too painful.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzFiN2M3NDM2NTRkMGY4OWNjM2VjZjhlNTQwMWNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He watched as the request broke through his ward, searing down through the planet's atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTQ3NjFjYWFiMDQ3NWM5ZDE5NmExNWRkOTA3N2Rk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment it collided with him, he opened the channel.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjdlZjdmZDM4YjQwOWNiMWZlOTBmOWI2MDlmYmI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong>Who dares?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">” he asked, pushing as much </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">anger </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">as he could into the channel.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGVlYmVkYTk3NTQyODVhZmNhNzUzMWQ0ODQ4ZGMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few seconds passed, and there was no answer. He hoped his reply would scare off or even kill whoever was on the other end, but he didn’t expect his hopes to bear fruit. The connection was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">strong</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. He would have to sacrifice years of strength to break it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTMzMTM2NjUzNjRjNzM4OGRlNTY1ZjBjY2VmYWI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong>Umm, hello!</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">” came a sudden reply. A voice. A woman. Young? Could it be that terrible demigod? “</span><strong>I’m Amelia! It’s nice to meet you!</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">” The voice continued. It wasn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was someone else. “</span><strong>Look, I’m really sorry about this, but I need-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzU0ODczOWZjNTQzOTlhMDExZDBkMzkzYWZiYTdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong>I refuse.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">” Suijin sent his angry reply. He cared little for what this woman wanted.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDY4YmNjMGI4NTQ4Y2JiMzBhZDU1MjFkMzYyOWY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong>Wait! Let me explain! There’s this massive fire, and your embodiment is what-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjU1YjY3NTI0NTQ5NmU4ZThiZDg1ODU2NGViN2Iz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong>I refuse</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDA3ZjljZTE0MjRjYmViMzYxMWQ4M2U0ZWUyYzE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong>Now…</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">” the voice paused. “</span><strong>Listen here, you bloody-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmQ5YjVjZDhmMzRmYmViNDIwNjM3ZTMxZGVmYTVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anger. Frustration. Annoyance. All these emotions came through the channel. The strength of the connection intensified, and he caught a glimpse of the person on the other end.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTZiYmZhZGNiMTRjYWRiNmVlYzZjMTk5NzY3MDU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond the superficial structure of her body, he could see her soul.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWMxNDk3NDU0ZjRkNjc4ZTFhZmE0YTNjMDFkM2Jk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin opened his eyes wide, stretching his divine perception to the limit. Was he mistaken? He peeled away the layers of reality between him and this requestee, using the connection to move his perception closer and get a better look at the woman’s soul.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTQ4NWVlOTBlOTRkYmViM2M2NGQ1Nzc5NWRjMjlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2M0MDQ4NjVkZDQzMzY4NGU4MGJkOWYxZTlmZjk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no mistake.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmFhYmExMTQ0ZDRmYjA4ODYzNTgzZjQ1Y2U4N2Ix" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Alone on that planet, there was no one to see Suijin smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjA5ZTc5YTJkMjQzODI5MDRmZDFkZmNkYTYwNmY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But smile he did.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTI0YzJlNmI3YTQ2MjQ5ZjFkNTM0NTYwN2IyYTEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong>I accept,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400">he said, sending his answer down the channel.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjZiYzljZWI1YjQ4YjE4NTJhYTVkOGMzMzZiOTgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly after, he sent his embodiment.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjBmNTA2OTNiYzRkNTdhMmZiNDc5ZWVmYTc0Mjkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He would watch this closely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZThmYjk3NTNmNzQ2ZDZhODMzNWM0NGY5YjcyZGRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">To think… this is how I would see you again, Esmeralda</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Suijin thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjhjMjEwNGQ5NDQwYWQ4Y2FjMjU3YjU1YmVkMTc3" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be an honour to aid you, even if only in part</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhNzgwMGE5OGE3NzRjOTE4NmY1ZDliNWMwNWRlM2Ux"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM0YmY1ZWQzMjhiZTRlNThiYjJkYzY5NzEyNjg0ODFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serenity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDQwMjY4MDg1YzQ0ZjViZmJmYTliYjI1ZDdkYzhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the sensation Amelia felt shortly after </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> had suddenly agreed to her request.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTMxMzYzZTFkYjRlY2M4MWJiODM0Y2UwZmY3NjY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, there was an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">odd</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> feeling of her body becoming something new and the unfathomable surge of power that now coursed through her very essence. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWM3M2QzZWQ1MDQwZjA5ZDlhNDViODk1NTM3ZTdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But, after that?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzMwNDMzODFjYjRlNWQ5ZjhiOTdiODhjODgxODRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serenity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzkyMzcyMjRlMjRkMzJhNTRkNTkxMzhmZjJmMWE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia felt like a calm winter’s lake, perfectly still. She instinctively knew she had control over </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin’s </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">power. It was strange… he felt </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">familiar</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It wasn’t the same as when she invoked </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, where the messy communion made her manic and she needed Serena to calm her down.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTFjMzE0MmIzNjRkOTJiNDQwNTcxMjdjZmEyZjc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No, this time, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was working with her. She wasn’t sure why; she’d been in the middle of giving the snarky deity a proper dressing down when the request was suddenly accepted. Nevertheless, he had accepted, and now she was once again in possession of more power than she knew what to do with.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjEwZjE5YmZjMDQ4YjViN2EyYzIyZmE5OThmYzI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia didn’t know what form she had and didn’t feel the urge to check. She did notice, however, upon opening her eyes and seeing Serena and Greatlord Oshiro hovering near her face with tense expressions, was how big she was. She was sure she could open her mouth and gobble them both whole!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTE2OGMwMDQ2YjQ4ZWViY2ZmYTE5MjU5ZjM2MDI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Heh. Maybe another time.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjNjN2VkOTM4NDRiNzc4ZDIxMmYwNmU0ODY1OThj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello,” she said. Her voice was melodic and lyrical. “Did you wait long?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTA0OTUyODBkYzQ1NjNhMGUwZGIxZTEwOGYxOTc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia…?” Serena asked, her eyes widening.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTk0Y2JiY2RlNzQ4YWM5MDA4NWVkMjdiZmVkYzM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I have control. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">accepted.” Amelia felt herself smile. She looked down.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzA0ZTMyNzMxNjQxYWQ4YzFjYjc5Y2NkY2E4NGJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh my, she was enormous this time. Much bigger than </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius’s </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">embodiment.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmQyMDFmYTQ4ZDQxNjlhYzJhYjRlZjExMTA3ZDE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The inferno licked at her sides, but Amelia wasn’t worried. That fire would need enough energy to boil an ocean before it would irritate her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWQ2MDQ4MTQ4ODQ4MjFhMTIyNGUyMDllZjRjMzgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">How silly of it to rear its ugly head against her and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTNiM2FiMTNlMjQ3NTg5MTI4M2NhMGE3ZTY2ZjI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll begin now,” Amelia sang.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjlhMjQ2NTdmMzQzYTc5YmMzMTViYmVlNWY3NjIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t need to move, or make any gestures. No, Amelia was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">serene</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She gently told her aether to manifest some water, and it did. A square kilometer of water, perhaps an inch thick, manifested near her feet, above the buildings. The water wanted to fall, to assault the insulting inferno underneath. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTY0MGYyYjUwZTQ4NTRiMmYzNDY1Y2YyYzExODJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">So Amelia let it fall.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2NhMzJjNjU2ODQyMGJhNjVmNzg0ZDIzOWZjMjU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">You’re not welcome here,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she thought, enjoying the sounds of the fire’s energy depleting.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWVjZWUxYjU2NjQ3N2ViY2U2NDRiYmE3YjAxNWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She summoned another plane of water, then another. Soon, the vast quantities of smoke were outdone by the rising steam. Another plane of water, then another. A few remnants of fire remained, so she summoned another, final plane.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDM0NzUwNWMxNjQyNjE5MGM4MmMzZjcxMjBmNDVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was winter, wasn’t it? She kept the water warm, and instructed it to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">stay </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">warm for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2UwMGJmMTJmODRjNDZhMjc0ZjMzMmY5Mzk2ZTk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia!” she heard Serena call. “I think… I think that’s enough!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2E3ZjEyZGYxYjRjMGNhNjhkMjJlYzBkYTA5NDNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, that’s right. She’d essentially produced the equivalent of half a foot of rain over two minutes. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjA0ZDU3MDQzYzQwNmU5NTRmOTY0NTY2ZGRhM2Jm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She wouldn’t get in trouble for a little bit of flooding, would she?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmQ4MjVhMjgxMjQ4ZjdiNmI3NDIwZjhjY2NhYzY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia stretched her senses, detecting the lives of every resident still hiding in the basements. She was worried that water would pool in those locations, potentially drowning the last survivors of the now-extinguished fire.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzI4Mzg3OGJiOTQ2Y2NhNWNiODU4YWJhNGYwMzdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">So she commanded the water not to enter the basements, and it obeyed her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjg4YTljODMyMDQ2NjE4NzY2ZmIwZTdjYWYxNjg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Water was her element, after all.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTdjNzk1MDRlMjQ2OTI5NDc0YmNiMTRhNWFjN2Fi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After such smoke and ash-filled chaos, the now water-logged lowlands were at peace. Amelia could relax and return to her original form. She’d done plenty now. She could hear the cries of relief of those she saved. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTU3ODRmNmM0ZTRiOGRiM2M4MGVmYjk5OTZiYzI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She giggled, the noise sounding ethereal. It made her feel so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">good</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to help so many! What was the problem with a little Second-Word embodiment if it could produce such a positive result?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWZjMmM1NmEzMjRmNTM5NTkxYjNjMGQ3NzcwMTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She let go of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> power, returning it to the strangely obedient god.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2IxODY4MWU3ZTQyZTg4NjE1NTJjYmYyZWE0ZWRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He spoke to her as she did.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDhmODc5OTc4ZDQ1ZWQ4YzYwOTc1NWI2YzZhMzc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a kind soul</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Suijin said in her mind. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She would be proud of you.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlMWJhMzMwZTg4MjQ5Y2NhYWFkNTA4MGQ4YjdhOGM0" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe… if it’s you… she can come back.</span></em></p>

<p class="cnMzY2ExMjMyOTk0YTQ3ZDBhMWQwMTNjOTNkYWQxNzFk"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/starla.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnM1YjIyNTQzMmQ1OTQyNmM5OGI5NDdlMmUyYTAyZjg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Starla knew arriving early to parliament was a good idea. The side-benches were not yet fully occupied so she was able to find herself a seat with a good view of the House. Although the five-hundred-year-old building - with its stained-glass windows depicting the Empress slaying the Enemy - first prompted her to open her mouth in awe, she was now used to it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGU3Mjc2MmVlMjQxYmU5OTkxMmZiMTgwY2E1ODU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The House doors were yet to open, but through them Starla could hear frenzied debate going on. She looked at the Lord Speaker, who was in discussion with the Clerk of the House and the Serjeant-at-Arms. The latter was the only person allowed in parliament capable of manifesting aura. The Serjeant-at-Arm’s name was Honora Duguie, a famous Speaker with an almost unrivalled military record and someone Starla greatly admired. The woman had retired to politics, where she famously refused Lordship, preferring to stay in the House of Commons over moving to the House of Lords. Now, she served as the House’s Serjeant-at-Arms, responsible for protecting the civilian delegations that were more of a danger to each other than any outside force.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Mjg0MzYyYzEwYjQ1MmM4MjRiYTAzODdjNmRlMDcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They wore tense expressions, no doubt mentally preparing for the chaos ahead.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzJlMzMwYzRhOTRkMWU4M2M3YjE2NDQyMmZhNjJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Going to be a wild one,” she whispered to her colleague. “Hear that outside? They’re already clashing horns! Oh…” She fingered through the documents she carried, pulling out a report. “Here’s the sewage flow rate figures. Someone sent them to my desk instead of yours.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTgzNzE1ODVlZjQzZWViMDlhOTljY2IyOWQxMmY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks, Miss Seraphine.” Her colleague took the paper with a smile. “Somehow, I think the sewage question won’t be on today’s agenda. What do you think he’ll start with?” He nodded towards the Lord Speaker to their left, whose seat overlooked the rows of benches waiting to be filled with the Empire’s delegations.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmYwYWUxNjE3YjQ2MzA5YzAyYTFhNmZiMzVmMTdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surely it’ll be the fire, right? That’s on everyone's mind and the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">honourable</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> rabble outside won’t cool down till it’s discussed.” Starla reached back, tying her blond hair into a ponytail. Then she clenched her hands around her small Cerulean horns and gave her colleague a tired-looking expression. “This is how I expect we’ll feel by the end!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGRlMzhlMjhmZDRmZTRiNzE4MmFiMDJmYmE0MDk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Titters erupted around her. Like her, Starla’s colleagues carried documents full of facts and figures, ready to supply the Centralis delegation should they need to double-check anything. With a minute until the doors opened, the side benches had hushed discussions about the upcoming session.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGVhMmYzYmY5YTRmNzE4YzVmMzcwYzA4YjUxNDk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How angry do you think Yannis will get this time?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2Y2MTRiY2Q2YzQ3ODI5YTFiOTdjZDRjMTU2NmM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Willem will have his horns wrapped around his fingers, ha!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGYzMDM3ZGFiYzQ5NDJiMmM1ZGNhMzIzMzNjZTU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I passed through the lobby; the West sent a proper delegation this time!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWRkNTk3ZjlhODQxYzNhMWFlZDczNzcxZTJlMTIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh? That’s unusual. Are they finally reacting to Thornheart?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmRmYmI3OTM5YzQwYjhiNGQ2ODVlMjI5YjEzZWI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the final seconds ticked by, the anticipation rose. Even the noise outside the door dimmed down. Starla could imagine them now, crowding around the door, trying to be first in line.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmJkMWY3NDI1YTQ1NTZiOWIwZmI1YzZjMWU2Y2Jl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Serjeant-at-Arms!” called the Lord Speaker. “The sooner you have those doors open, the sooner we can be done. If you could, please.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzEyZTk3MjY1YjQ5ZjVhYTE2YWIyMWRlOTJlMDUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Lord Speaker.” Honora nodded her head and walked to the other side of the room. Once at the doors, she lifted the large brass knocker and used it to knock thrice - producing powerful </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thuds</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that echoed through the House. “Make way for the doors!” Honora shouted before knocking three more times. She then moved the large bolt keeping the House’s doors barred and pushed them open, revealing the gathering of civilian delegations.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjU5M2VlYzY1MzQ5ODk5MjZkMjBlMTBjYTM1ZTM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Centralis delegation entered first, their expressions dark, contrasting their fair hair and blue eyes. Whatever arguments had been going on beyond the door, it was clear they’d been in the centre of it. Still, with their dark robes trimmed with gold thread, they maintained their composure as they took their seats. The Head of the Delegation, the Right Honourable Willem Pieter, sat in front, flanked by his two officers: Johann Leopold and Maria Catharina. Behind him, the remainder of the delegation, more than two dozen pairs of horns, crammed themselves into the limited bench space. More than a few were relegated to standing at the back.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjhiM2Q3ZWQ5NzRmM2ViOTJhZjhiMDJkMDc5ZDJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then came the Eastern delegation, led by the Right Honourable Tadashi Haruto and his two officers: Chen Liang with his thick-based Manwese horns and Jung Yoonah with her horns ending in the exotic twist found commonly in the Aindo people. They were all dressed in black and blue, their black hair and sharp eyes giving them a formidable appearance. Weapons were forbidden in the House, but Starla could easily imagine them as soldiers instead of the politicians they were. They took their seats opposite the Centralis delegation, their faces solemn.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTliMzIyYmU5ZjQyNjc4N2EwNzhlODJlNjg1ODFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Next through the door were the Northerners in black and purple. Their horns were more curly than most, matching their curly brown hair. Starla couldn’t help but admire their handsome faces, adorned with prominent noses, well-defined jawlines, and green eyes. Even though they were red-faced, with some grinding their teeth, it did little to harm their eye-catching appearance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWEzYWE5MGM0OTQzZTZhYzRiMzExN2JmNGExYjU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Led by the Right Honourable Yannis Theodoros, they sat down on the opposite side of the Centralis delegation, next to the Easterners. Yannis immediately entered into a hushed conversation with his officers: the angry-looking Mikkel Aslak and the sharp-eyed Freya Solveig. They occasionally glared at Willem Pieter and other members of the Centralis delegation but kept their cool.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWU0ZjIyYTE2YjRjMDk5MjA4NzRkYTBlYWMxYjYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">For now</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Starla thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTI0ZDUxNzYwNDQ5ZjdhYjNmM2IzNGQxMjI1OTAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the striking Southern delegation came striding through the doors. What skin could be seen through the black and red robes seemed almost painted, but Starla knew it was a natural feature of their ethnicity. They sported a variety of horns: the thick ram’s horn of the Wami people, the straight and smooth of the Yamenian folk, and the thick singular horns of the far southern pyramid-builders, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Arakian</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTYyNDFkMTM4MTRjYWFiMmEzMDdlMDBkYjdlYmY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their Head, a muscular, bald man named Lukas Stanislaw, sat down. Two female officers quickly followed him. Starla had seen them many times before: Aisha Laila from Yamen, and the elegant Nefertari Bastet from Jimar, home of the Empire-wide appreciated Jimari coffee. Nefertari especially caught Starla’s eye.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDgyMmRkZDIzNzQ3OWI5MjQ3NmZkOWM0NjQ3YjA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">If I stayed in the sun, would I ever get bronze skin like hers?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2E2YTZiMTI1YTQ0ODE5OGM2NDc1MGYxYzc4NmM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The southern delegation sat down opposite the northerners, next to the Centralis delegation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWZmMTFlN2NiNDRkNTk4YTE1NTkxZTA1NmUyMTk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lastly, the Western delegation arrived. Their numbers were smaller than the rest, and most of them were threehorns. The Head of the Delegation, Santiago Manuel, carried himself with a neutral expression. He and his officer, a demon named Antonio Alejandro from Ipar Binarri, made the sign of the Petrine cross towards the prominent stained-glass window of the Empress before sitting down next to the Northern Delegation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODY0MTE4ODgzNTRlYzE5OGNlNTBjMmRiYTI3MGY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Trailing him was a second officer with their robe hood up. As they passed the threshold into the House, the figure reached up and pulled their hood down. Although in the same black and green robes as the rest of the Western delegation, the man stood out. Not only was he a head taller than everyone else in the room, perhaps coming second only to the Lord Guardians protecting the Empress herself, but he had striking golden eyes sitting under a pair of horns that swept back so dramatically they were practically horizontal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDE1MTM5ZmIxMzQ4YjI4ZjJjNWYzZGI0ZmQ1Y2Fl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Never seen one before,” Starla muttered. “In person, I mean.” Drawings and photographs didn’t do them justice. Something about him gave off a sense of divinity. She’d never seen such a striking eye colour before! “Look at those eyes! It’s like they’re glowing! No wonder people say the Empress favours them!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjBjMTRmZmNkNjQ2MWZiZGFlZDk5MWE1MzUxMWQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was a Yoaltan, from as far west as the Aindo were to the east.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzM1MTUxNmQwYTQxYWVhNGQ4Mzg5MjgwYzAzZjQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She tried not to stare. Where exactly was he from? Ichtaca? Or the ever-mysterious Yolcoatl? Perhaps he was from the westernmost inhabited city of the Empire - </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Cozamanya</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? Perhaps one day, her career would take her to those places shrouded in obscurity and security. She’d heard everything from stories of demon sacrifice to cannibalism. As an adult, she knew such things were likely exaggerated, but even so, the Yoaltans were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so different</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDJjNDY2NDFiNzRmY2ViMmFjNjI2NzU1MDQ3MTQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s Tenoch Xolotl,” her colleague whispered. “He last appeared when the Wartime Powers Act was invoked, and before that… eight years ago when the war broke out! They must have something important to say if he’s here!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmFiYWI1ZTllOTQzNTlhYzIwZDA5OWQ4Y2JjZTgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Clearly, much of the House was having similar thoughts. The distraction of Tenoch Xolotl’s appearance was even sufficient to stop the Northerners and their Centralis rivals from burning holes into each other. Murmured gossip filled the hall as the Yoaltan’s presence made himself known.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDdjZDJjNzYwNDRlMmM4NGUyM2RkYTNmZGQwMTIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Honora closed the doors, slamming the massive bolt across. She then waited to play the final part of the parliamentary ceremony. She didn’t have to wait long as three loud thumps sounded from beyond the door as someone pounded their fists against the wood.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGUyMDc4YTI2ZDRmMjdhZWNmYjliMmFmYWRhOWQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Serjeant-at-Arms! What is the meaning of this!?” the individual shouted, his voice muffled through the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDhjMzFiZGU4OTRiOWFiNTYwOGY4MDUzZGE5ZjZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Three more thumps.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTIwNjRmZWZmMjQ4OThiOWIyMWVmOWFmMDE3ODI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Open the House doors immediately!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTUxMWM2YzJkNTRjNzI4OGZlOGFkZTAxYmZiYjQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Honora cleared her throat. “You are not welcome, most honourable sirs!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjlkYTI1NmZhZDQ0ZTA5MDNjYjUxNTE3NDJlMzhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Three more thumps.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTI1ZDk3ZjY5ZTRkYjA4NjllZmQzMGFhNDRjMzkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are the Empress’s representatives! We demand you let us in!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGM5M2JjY2FhYzQ3Y2Y4ZTcyYmFlOTViNTQ2NTc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Honora shouted her demand back. “Do you vow to guarantee us adequate representation, sirs!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzBiOTc0N2Y0MDQ5ODJhMDM1MTg0NDBhYTg5MjNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A pause. Then, three more thumps.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDYzZjAyOWI4ZTRhYzRhNDBmODZiNjI2ZDkyYTk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We vow! In the name of the Empress, let us in!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjIxNjM0Y2YxNDQ3Mjk4NWFkMDBjZGY5OGJhMmYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The vows are heard!” Honora stated loudly to the House. “Lord Speaker?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmJjMjNmNjkyMjRhOTY5YjliNzEzMWQ1NDFiZGNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let the Imperial delegation in!” the Lord Speaker announced from his high seat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTBhYjQ5OGI2MTQ3MGM5OGNhM2FkZDc4ZDM0OTU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Honora pulled the iron bolt across, opening the door once more.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjk3MzkzYjJlOTRlNzM5ZjU1OTBmNzM3NGNlYzAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial delegation appeared. Like Starla, many of them were of Cerulean heritage; their hair was light of colour, their horns small, and their eyes blue. They strode in with robes of white and gold before getting on one knee and making the sign of the Petrine cross before the stained-glass window. They took their position in the benches to the left of the Lord Speaker, the opposite of where Starla and her colleagues sat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODJjZmVjNmZlNTQwOTQ5OWVlOTE1MWQ4NTEwZmFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Starla found the ceremony strange the first few times. It was a retelling of the dramatic happening that occurred almost four hundred years ago, where Imperial power overreached, and the Empire’s delegations famously refused to let them into the House. The ceremony was reenacted every week, a constant reminder of the balance of power between the civilian delegations and their Cascadian Lord Superiors.</span></p><span class="cmEzYjgxYmVjYzI0OTRkMzk5MDZhYWI0MDFkYTBiM2Fh"><br/>Support the creativity of authors by visiting Royal Road for this novel and more.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNiMGQ5NTU1Mzg3MDQzMjdiYzhjYjYzZThiNjE1NmM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Honora closed the door for a final time, taking her position beside it. It was now her duty to prevent anyone from trying to enter unauthorised and intervene in any fights. Starla couldn’t help but find herself impressed by the gravitas this one woman held without even moving.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWNjNGJjZmE0NTQ4ZDE4OWM4YzAwYjNkYjFmMTM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Lord Speaker banged his gavel. “Silence!” he shouted over the murmuring politicians. Once the noise had dimmed, he announced, “Here I, Lord Speaker of the House of Commons, open the fifty-first parliamentary session in the year of her divinity and grace, eight-forty-six!” He slammed his gavel down twice more, punctuating his statement.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzE5Yzk3ZWM4OTRjOGViYTgwM2EyNWYwODM5MTQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to him, the Clerk of the House typed away on a typewriter, documenting the proceedings.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmYxMmYxNTIyYTRkNGZiN2I1NjUxMTUzZDJlMTg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before we begin,” the Lord Speaker intoned, his voice becoming soft. “I believe I speak for all of us to say we are shocked and horrified at the tragedy that has befallen the Asamaywa lowlands.” Across the room, the delegations nodded solemnly in agreement, with a few calling out, ‘Hear, hear!’. The Lord Speaker waited for the commotion to die down before continuing, “To the honourable delegation from the East, would they perhaps like to give the House an overview of the events that transpired? I am sure many have questions.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTE0NTA3Nzc2NDQ4YTNhZDA0NWEyMjQ1Yjk3NGRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Head of the Eastern Delegation nodded and rose from his seat.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGIxNjg5NzkxNzQwN2NiYzZiNWQ0NzFjMTk4ZjA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The House recognises the Right Honourable Tadashi Haruto!” announced the Lord Speaker, bringing his gavel down once. “The floor is yours, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzhkYzdhMTQwYTQxNWNiNWRiZmNlNTg4YjJjYTdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Lord Speaker.” Tadashi cleared his throat, looking around the room at his fellow politicians. “A flame,” he began, “Starting from something as little as an unattended oven of a lowland bakery became, in a matter of minutes, the raging conflagration that we understand to have claimed the lives of nearly three hundred demons…” Tadashi paused as if waiting for the number to simmer in the minds of everyone present. “The number continues to rise as we discover more bodies. We thank you for your kindness.” Tadashi bowed deeply to the House.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzA5NWE0OGUwZjQxNmE4YjUzODVmNTdmNmY2OWY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Not very forthcoming</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Starla thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">How much are they hiding?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhMTQ3OGQ4NDJhZDQ3OGI4YmFlNDk0YTg0ZDEzYmM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Numerous hands went up, mainly from the Northern delegation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2MzMWE4YTM4ODQ0ZGVhMzc0NGQ4MWRkOWYwZjBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Right Honourable Yannis Theodoros!” The Lord Speaker announced, his voice tense.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2YyNDI3MTBkZTRiNjE5NmZlNDUzYmIwOGQyY2I4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thank you, Lord Speaker,” Yannis intoned, his face still red from his earlier arguments outside. “The North, of course, extends its deepest sympathy to the troubles in the East, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">however</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…” he said, his brow furrowing. “I can’t help but note that the Right Honourable Sir lacks details regarding the most important part! I ask my honourable friend, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">how was the fire extinguished</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” Yannis waited while many of his delegation nodded their agreement. A few others, notably in the southern delegation, were also nodding.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzA1NzAzZTcyNTRhZDk4NTM1M2JkMzkyMTRmYjky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Speaker,” Tadashi responded. “I hope the Right Honourable Sir did not mean to suggest the East would withhold information from the House.” The demon sorted through some papers in his hand, taking a few seconds to read something. “Nor is the following something we would ever wish to hide! Lord Speaker, I am happy to inform the Right Honourable Sir that the fire was extinguished by a combined effort of mages, warriors, Lords, and civilians all working together to minimise casualties. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…” Tadashi’s eyes narrowed. “The final act was achieved by a successful embodiment of the long-lost and now reclaimed water god, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTllMmY5N2U1YzQxZDBhNjdkMjA0MGFiODE1OTUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A tittle of murmurs rocked the House. So it was true! Starla had heard the rumours but couldn’t believe it until now. Someone in the East had managed to commune with the lost god. The ancient power last channelled in the South centuries ago had reappeared in a different Terra Firma.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGIxMWMwYjUyYjQ3ZDJiNDY2NTEzNzc5ZWJmODli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Southern delegation wouldn’t be happy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2EzMGEzNDEwZDQxYzY4ZTY1YTFkY2MwMGU3YjI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The embodiment enabled sufficient amounts of water to be manifested to quell the fire,” Tadashi said. “We have an official photograph taken of the embodiment. My officers will pass it around now.” Jung Yoonah and Chen Liang stood up on cue, passing large printed photographs to the remaining delegations. Copies were passed to the Lord Speaker and Starla was delighted to see even she got her copy. It even was in colour!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzA2MzNkOTk0MzRkOTRhYmM0MTMyMDY0NDU3NWUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her delight changed to confusion as she looked at the photograph.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWY0MzNjZjZkODRjNzFhMjgzNzA3MmFmMTYxNjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Against a backdrop of black smoke - more smoke than she ever thought a fire could produce - was an ethereal creature. It took the form of an elegant woman floating just above the ground. Her body was slender, wrapped in sheets of blue silk that trailed off her as if suspended in water. The silk formed a set of closely fitting robes decorated with glowing runic symbols that made it seem like spellwork had been woven into the very fabric.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjU1YTUyODY1YzQxYTI4ZjQyZDllMmFmZjQ5MzE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Starla moved her gaze up. The woman's face had an alien beauty to it. Her eyes were closed and her dark blue hair seemed to float. Three pairs of black horns sprouted from her head, and two sets of enormous white wings emerged from behind her back. The wings were partially wrapped around her body as if she were about to hug herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWMxN2Q1OGY4NTQ4MmRhMDc0ODZiZWJiYjY5Y2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at her feet!” someone near her whispered. “Isn’t that a house!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDIyNDkwZTJiZTRmMTU5NzY3MDJhY2M2ZTZjNzIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Starla looked at the photograph, her eyes widening to see that this wasn’t a normal-sized woman. She could see a half-destroyed house at her feet, barely making it past her ankles. If… if that was accurate… then </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">how tall was this embodiment!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Forty meters!? No… it could even be more!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWY5YTEyNWUyZjQ3NWI5MTA5NTQ0YzBkYzMzNzdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Speaker…” Yannis slowly began after examining his copy of the photograph. “I, of course, would never imply the Right Honourable Sir would intentionally hide things from the House and I thank him for this photograph. Lord Speaker, a further question to the East: Who amongst their ranks managed this wondrous feat!? I believe our friends in the South are eager to know this!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTY5OWNmMmMxYjRjMDM5MTk1OTQxMDllNzBiNzBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At his words, a few yells originated from the southern delegation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjI5ZTA5ODI5NjRkOTFiYTBkODdkMWI2MTAzZDA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjJlOTBmYTU5NjRmMjNiM2Q3MjZjMTAyNjA5Yzc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Name them!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDg5N2MyYmYzYTRhYzdhMmVkZGFkZDZmYWExNDdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s our god!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGFjMmMwZDgxNzRhMGVhNzI0NmVmZDVmMmUzOTNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Silence!” the Lord Speaker banged his gavel. “The Right Honourable Sir has been </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">asked </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">a question and I’m sure he’ll </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">answer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> if you give him a chance!” The Lord Speaker glared at the agitated Southern delegation before addressing Tadashi in a softer voice. “The floor remains yours, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGYwMDZiODAyNDRhMjBhNGRlMGYxMjFjNTlhYmIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Lord Speaker,” Tadashi cleared his throat. “I regret to inform the Right Honourable Sir that I, too, share his curiosity at the individual behind such a magnificent communion.” A wave of tutting made its way through the House, but Tadashi ignored it and continued, “Our Overlord had chosen to invoke the right of Speaker Secrecy in this matter and as a result, I will not be able to provide a name.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2U0Zjk0MDZiNzQwNzE4OTQwNmZiMWI0OWUyOWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That may well be, Lord Speaker!” Yannis immediately began firing back as if expecting that answer. “Only in my hand, right </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…” He flourished a few pieces of paper bound together. “I have a report from an Intelligence official working in the East that has identified a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very curious</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> individual behind </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> embodiment!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzUwODE5ZjhhYzQ5NGU4NmM3NDdhMDg1NjUwMTA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Starla, along with everyone else, was momentarily transfixed by the paper in Yannis’s hands. Looking at Tadashi and his officers, Jung and Chen, their expressions noticeably darkened. Did Yannis truly know? Starla looked at the magical, beautiful woman in the photograph. Who was it? Who could invoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and produce such a beautiful embodiment?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjdkMDU3NTExZTRmZDBhN2IwZDA0ZjNiN2EyNWVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Speaker, the name identified is one we’ve all become </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">extremely</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> familiar with!” Yannis announced, holding the paper out and spinning on the spot. “You all know who I am referring to! The very same name that has been discussed in every parliamentary session for the last six weeks! I, of course, am talking about…” He took a dramatic pause. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzMxYWViYzJjNTRkNjJiODRiYmE1YmU1NzdlYTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Thornheart!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzMzMWFjNDU1MDQyOGU4MTc1OTgzZmMxOWEyMTdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, Starla and her colleagues joined the outburst at Yannis’s statement. Thornheart was a Second-Word Speaker!? Not only that, but she invoked </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Starla was shaking her head. No way! There was no way a human could do that! Wasn’t she supposed to be young!? Yannis must be mistaken! Starla looked at the photograph again.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWY5ZjAwNDIzMzQxNzY4NjgzYWRjYTAzMjAyMjRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There… was a resemblance, wasn’t there? Their faces were similar. Was it really her?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWVjYWYxOGZmNDRlOGM4NjczMGQ4Y2FjZmNjNjI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her thoughts were voiced by the rest of the demons, whose protests were all shouted out into a symphony of noise.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjU3OWE1NDVkZDRiYmRiZTIyZmZiODlhNmQ5OGU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A human Speaking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!? Impossible!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDM4ZWUyYTA2MTRlZDBhZGY4YzI3NGMyZjhlOWU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Empress must intervene!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWIyNmI2MjJkOTQ3ZGE5N2UxZWZhODgwMzllNmFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are the East playing at!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTY1NjY1N2E5YzRjYjdhN2I0NjY3YmI5ODVlMzUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nonsense! Hokum!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODVjNDhhM2IyMTRlNzNiMzBjYmEyN2ZlMThiYjZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is not hokum!” Yannis bellowed before the Lord Speaker could bang his gavel. “I have it on trusted authority! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Spoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the lowlands of Asamaywa! Is this not a great embarrassment for the Empire!?” As Yannis spoke, his voice grew louder and louder, fighting to be heard over the growing commotion. “Lord Speaker! How can we sit here without shame when a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> invokes our most powerful Words!? I must ask the Imperial Representative to answer! What is the Empress’s position!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGM3ODNmMzY4ZTRmM2U5YWQ5YWU2ZDRlYTEzODA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Silence! Damn you! Silence!” The gavel was slammed downwards thrice. “I will have silence!” The Lord Speaker shouted until his voice was the only one that could be heard. “Thank you,” he finally intoned. “This House will have order! Now…” he turned to his left. “I believe the Head of the Imperial Delegation, the Right Honourable Edward Alistair, has a comment! The floor is yours, sir!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWI5NGJjNjE4YjRmZTliNDU3ZTBhYTExNzNlYTNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The white-robed Imperial representative stood up. Edward Alistair took a moment to observe the room, and once he seemed certain everyone’s attention was on him, he opened his mouth and said, “The Empress intends to respect the Eastern Overlord’s right to Speaker Privacy. That is all.” With that, he sat down.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzFmNTYzOGJmMzRmOGM5NjI3ZmMxMzVjYzFkZTM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Speaker!” Tadashi shouted before the commotion could start up again. “While the name of the individual is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> known…” Tadashi greatly emphasised his words. “The name </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> known to all of us. Although I call into question the veracity of the Right Honourable Sir’s report…” Yannis sniggered, folding his arms in protest. Tadashi ignored him. “I would like to continue our report regarding Thornheart’s actions!” The demon took a sip of water before continuing. “Lord Speaker! As we all know, Thornheart is a human Speaker! Not of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Rula</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Word of the weaker human branch of healing… No! Lord Speaker, Thornheart is a Speaker of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! The much more powerful branch of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">divinity</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!” Tadashi spread his arms wide. “Is this not a great thing for our Empire!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzBiNDczYTNkMTQ5ZDE4MjAyYzIwMjIyZTc2YjM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At his words, many in the Eastern and Centralis delegation nodded, murmuring their agreement. Tadashi, seemingly finding his stride, continued, “I once again have to question the Right Honourable Sir’s incessant suspicion and argumentation regarding </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!” Tadashi dramatically pointed to the stained-glass window with its rendition of the Empress shining down upon the House. “Our Overlord himself has sanctioned her! As I have informed the Right Honourable Sir </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">multiple </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">times in the past, I now once again remind him that she was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">successfully</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> screened by Intelligence!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWY4MzE1ZDgzNzQxYTVhMjkxZGE5ZTUwMDczZDk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right!” someone from the Centralis delegation called out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjExYmVmOTMwZjQ1MDRhZWMyZWM3MTRmZGRiZDQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s on the Empire’s side!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGM5MjdhZTZhODRjY2ZiNjYyYjhmNDJkYmRiZTc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Servant of the Empress!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjhhYTRkYmExMTQxYmViZjU1NTEzMWQ2MzAwMjk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A priceless asset!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTM4MDI3MTE0ZTQ1ZDFhMjE2YWU0ZWY5MmM2YWY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Speaker!” Tadashi shouted. “The Honourable Sirs and Madams across from me have their horns straight! For </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, a wandering healer born in Karligard, to find her way to the Empire while avoiding the clutches of the Vatican is a sign from the Seven Hells! A blessing of the Moons! During the inferno that claimed the lives of so many, Thornheart’s divine healing saved </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thousands </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">from the same fate! She worked directly under the supervision of Greatlord Oshiro and Highlord Yasuda! Because of her, the Asamaywa Station was saved! Now!” Tadashi fixed his eyes on Yannis. “Do I need to remind the North how difficult it would be for us to supply the battlefield if we lost such a key part of our rail network!? I see the Right Honourable Sir is shaking his head, Lord Speaker! May I ask, why!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzNhNGJjMTdiZTRiZWE4N2IxM2QzMGYzMmYyZWYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yannis stepped forward, raising his hands to the sky. “Lord Speaker, what has overcome us! Sometimes, I wonder if the Honourable Sirs and Madams think they should be worshipping Amelia Thornheart instead of our great Empress!” The Northern delegation sent out a series of jeers in support of the proclamation. The Southern delegation added their support while the East and Centralis delegations shook their heads.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTBhMWE5OGY3ZTRmNmE5NzkxZmRmMGU4YzdmNTlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Starla glanced towards the Western delegation. They were sitting still, barely reacting to the chaos.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODk4ZjUwY2U0ZjRlMDJiOGE0ZDFjYzhhNDI0NWE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Speaker!” Tadashi called out. “I see that the Right Honourable Willem Pieter is eager to address this hogwash! I give my floor to him!” Tadashi sat down as Willem Pieter stood up.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2MxMzhmYmFkYjQ0Mzc5MWEwYzVjZGZkMTU3NDVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The House recognises the Right Honourable Willem Pieter!” the Lord Speaker shouted, banging his gavel.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGM3NzNiMzlkNjQzZTliMDIxN2M2NWU5YmI2ZGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My sincere thanks, Lord Speaker” Willem began, his face holding a sly smile. “I fear for the Right Honourable Sir from the North. He’s become as red as the red moon! I worry he may soon explode!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDI0Y2ZjMjlmNzRmYWJiOTQwYzdjYTIyZGM3MGYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Laughter erupted from the Centralis delegation, prompting Yannis’s face to contort angrily.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2E1YjJhZTVkOTRhNGFhMjdlYzg5MGJjZmM5NTFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I say only this, Lord Speaker,” Willem continued. “The presence of Amelia Thornheart continues to be, if you forgive the pun, a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thorn</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the side of the rebellion! Are we not well informed that this human Speaker of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, who has allied herself with Cascadia, has seriously impacted the morale and unity of the human nations? Shouldn’t the North be thankful for the chaos this one singular human has caused amongst our enemies?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDFkZDNkMWQzODQ2YTJiY2FmMDczOTMwZjMxZjFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good point!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmZmMjczN2QxMzQwN2U5ZDFjYzNmM2RlODFkYTA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hear, hear!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTY1NTk2NTY0NjRhMzE5N2NhYjBmNDM2NzA5M2Y5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ya!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2I2YmFhZWE2NzRhYjI4NWNkZmNhNTY2MTU0MjU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Speaker!” Yannis bellowed. “The Right Honourable Sir must have his horns twisted! We hear different whispers on the battlefield! Whispers that the presence of Thornheart may prompt Christdom to formally join the conflict!” He pointed at the Centralis delegation. “Lord Speaker, they seem </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> relaxed. They think that just because Meppen has fallen, the war is over! Perhaps if Centralis would provide more </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">divisions,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> then we might share with them their demeanor! The North bleeds!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGZlZTQ3MTM4NTRlYzM5Yzk0ZTZmNTI0ZWVkODIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The North bleeds!” echoed the rest of the northern delegation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDJhODM1NWI3NTRhNGE5OTU2MzFhODcxNjlmYWM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Speaker!” Willem protested. “I must find I am </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shocked</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to see such comments launched towards Centralis and its delegation!” He raised his two hands, palm down, carrying a puzzled expression. “Is it not true that the majority of munitions are manufactured by Centralis cities?” The Centralis delegation cheered. “Is it not true that we’ve supplied more than a hundred vessels to the North!? More than a hundred thousand men!?” More cheering. “Without Centralis, the North would have nothing to shoot! The North bleeds, yes.” Willem looked exasperated. “But so does Centralis!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDk4NDdjZDU3NzQzNjQ4YWViN2VjYjI0MzI4YmFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps, Lord Speaker,” Yannis growled. “If the Right Honourable Sir had ever served, he would understand things better. I note to the House that the Right Honourable Sir’s excuse for not volunteering was a medical reprieve, yet I’ve never seen him looking healthier over these last eight years! Why is that, do we think?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTQ0ZmVlZWE4ZDRjMDhiOTQ0MTQxMjQwOTc3ZWM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… you accuse me of cowardice!?” Willem spluttered, his previously controlled expression falling quickly to anger. “Is that your claim, Honourable Sir!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTkxNTJlNGU4YjRkMjlhOTdlZTZiYmZiY2M4ZTk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is not, Lord Speaker!” Yannis scoffed. “I am merely concerned with what our peers might think while considering your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">questionable</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> medical history!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGZkMDEzNWQ3NjQ1OTBhMDYxZDY1ZTZlM2ViOGIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Starla sighed. Here they go. Yannis knew how to twist Willem’s horns as much as Willem knew how to twist Yannis’s.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTcxM2NiNmE0NTQzZDc5ZDUzMjMyNGMxNTFhMjc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I will not stand for this!” Willem yelled. “Lord Speaker, I must demand an apology this instant, or the Serjeant-at-Arms must surely remove the Honourable Sir for improper behaviour unfitting of a parliamentary representative!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTYyNTRjOTdkODRmYTQ4OGY0YmQ4ZjVlZjYxZDI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is no apology to be given!” barked Yannis.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWI0NzdkOGFkYjQ3YzQ5YTUzODc5NmRjNTU4ZmEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I demand you take back your words, sir!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOThjOWU0MjJkNDRmNjM4OWZjOTkyMWJmNDk0MDQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Speaker, I will not!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODczYzIwNTQ4MTQ1ZTNhNWM3MGI5NWNmYmMyYmE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I cannot let such an insult go unsatisfied, Lord Speaker!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWVkM2JjOWI4MTQzZjg4NWVkNzA3NjUwYjJkMDY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then the Honourable Sir can request satisfaction, Lord Speaker!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGY3MjAxMDhjYTRhOGZhMzNiMTE4ZGE0NzY2Y2Rm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will not be toyed with like this!” Willem spat, gritting his teeth. “I demand satisfaction!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTg2YWJkZTc4MzRhMTI5OTExMmEyZjk3NTE3MGFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A duel, sir!?” Yannis sneered. “With your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">medical</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> condition!?”</span></p>

Then you’ll finally know what it’s like to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bleed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTY2YmVhMDIxOTRlNWQ4ZWRkNTQwNTQ5MDZjNzc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will not listen to this any further! Dawn tomorrow, Honourable Sir!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDA1NTE5NTBiNTQ2NjI4OTIyNGFkOGE1ODAzNjM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dawn, tomorrow it is! I will bring my pistol!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGRmZTNmZmY3OTRlNzc5Y2MzMGU2NzU3YjI2MmEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As will I!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmEyYWVmZTdmYTRiNjI4OWMzZjJiMTVlYmRmMzIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well then!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjMyZTZiYzc2YjQxNjRhYzBiNGUzNDdmZjFlYWJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hrmph!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjM3MWE3OTY1MjQ4M2FhYTBlNzBmNTYxOTE0ZGVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTk4MWM4MTQ0YjQ3MzQ5NmVkODUxODU5OWE1ODhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The men, reddened with anger, huffed and puffed. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmFkYmM1M2NiODRhN2E5Mzk3NDI2ZDFhOTNlNzZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Starla couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzU4ZTFhOGVmYjQ0NThiMTcxNWU4NDM3NTdiNDBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My good men,” the Lord Speaker intoned. “Now that you’ve kindly agreed to make my job fifty per cent easier by the end of tomorrow…” The room erupted with laughter, with delegation members jeering while waving their papers in the air. “Let us proceed to the next matter while your blood cools. I believe the Southern delegation wished to-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTM2ZTBmYjE2YTQ5YjA4NDFkNWQ2M2Y0NjMwNzQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Lord Speaker cut off suddenly, his eyes fixed across the room. Starla followed his gaze, to see that Tenoch Xolotl had raised his hand. For a moment, the Lord Speaker only stared at the Westerner’s golden eyes before finally banging his gavel.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2Y2NTllMTgyMzRhNTJiNzEzYTI0MzFkMDFhMmU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The House recognises the Honourable Tenoch Xolotl!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGIzMmNiYjhhMTRiZTZiMzNhM2NkYzJmYzI1ODBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tenoch stood up, his presence seemingly filling the room. Once everyone’s attention was transfixed upon him, he bowed towards the Eastern delegation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2UyZDliYWEzZjRlYTBiNzY2MDhkNmUwZWI0ZDE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Honourable Sirs and Madams of the East,” he began, his strange accent tickling Starla’s ears. “Although we are different, separated by many thousands of leagues, we, too, know the pain of fire.” For a moment, Tenoch looked like he would elaborate on that matter, but he simply moved on. “You are in our hearts. Our Overlord desires to gift three thousand bottles of loqua to the East. A reward for those who worked so hard in fighting the terrible tragedy. Would you accept our Overlord’s kindness, honourable friends of the East?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWE5NzM1YmE0NDRmNDBhOGYxMmUyOWY4MjZhZDE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tadashi stood up, bowing deeply. “We will accept, Honourable Sir.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmJmZjYxMmMwZTRkNGNhOTc4Y2Q0ODExNTY2ZTFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were most fortunate,” Tenoch intoned. “To have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> so close. We of the West are happy to see another Terra Firma receive such a boon. Her actions are also the cause of my presence here today…” he turned, taking a sealed envelope from a delegation member. “Clerk of the House!” he called. “A missive from our Overlord!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmRkMGE3ZTE1YjQwMjA5MWFlZjJkNTc5Yjk3Y2Ix" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The clerk jumped, walking a bit too quickly to receive the letter from Tenoch. Starla could see the man visibly swallow. The Yoaltan must seem massive up close!</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzkyZDE0OGI3NzQyYjY4MTA1MDhmNDQxMzRmMjVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the Clerk was reseated, Tenoch continued, “A letter… consisting of an invitation and a recommendation.” The demon bowed again towards the Eastern delegation. “Our great and wise Overlord extends a formal invitation to Lord-Prospect Thornheart to travel to the Western Terra Firma and enjoy our…” The Yoaltan smiled, revealing several of his teeth were made of green crystal. “...delights.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzJmZmNlZDgyNDQ3OTBhYzFkZDM0MmIxNmY3ZjVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Murmuring and whispers spread throughout the House, silenced only by Tenoch continuing to speak. “Included is also a recommendation,” he intoned smoothly, glancing at his peers one by one. It seemed no one could meet his golden eyes. “From our Overlord to the Eastern Overlord, to sanction Amelia Thornheart with full Cascadian Lordship with all haste. For her noble and brave actions saving so many demon lives.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDAyNWNkYzZhODQ4ZGM5YzczMDIzMmRjNTFmYTdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, there was silence.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGQyM2U1ZmQ4MzQyMDI5ZTg3N2U4MWQzZTNhNmQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a chuckle sounded from the door. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTZmZjk5MTE2ZjRjYTRiNzc3ZjIxMDRjMDJlNzRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Honora Duguie, the Serjeant-at-Arms, was laughing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzNlZjJiNGNlZDQyNTM4OGI2NGY1OWRlMmQ4ZGVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And, as if her laughter gave everyone else permission, the House imploded into chaos.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODFhOTkzMjc3ODRjNWViYmJmODE5ZWVkNDhjZDBl" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The resulting commotion made Starla realise that her earlier joke about clutching her horns in frustration would become a reality.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxMTdkYWU0M2Y0ZTRjYTQ5MjEzMjc5YzY2NTZlMmFh"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjgyOGY4MTA0ZTRlYjI4NWUxYTMxZGNkOTVkNzEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The time following the fire was a blur.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjg0OWNmNzhlNDQ3NWE5YmJmM2U1MzQyNjc1NjQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the immediate aftermath, Greatlord Oshiro brought in a group of high-ranking Old Guard officers and intelligence officials and had everyone vow to keep the events secret. It quickly became apparent that the Eastern Lords intended to keep Amelia’s identity as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speaker secret.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTM4NjU4Zjg1OTQ4MTg4ZTc2MDIzMDNhZGZhMDFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">From what she understood, the vast majority of people in the East and the wider Empire only knew her as a Speaker of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. They weren’t hiding the fact she Spoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the academy; it just hadn’t become well-known yet. While that knowledge would spread, the East wanted to control the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> situation as much as possible. Not necessarily only for political reasons either; Amelia was informed that hiding Second-Word Speakers was a common practice for strategic reasons under a concept known as Speaker Secrecy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjgwNjZlZjcwOTQyMjBiNTRmNmEyYTU0OTRlNWVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She agreed to sign the documents demanding her compliance - at least, after having Serena thoroughly read through them first. Her and Serena’s version also included provisions against carelessly spreading knowledge about the existence and workings of the Shimmer, so they were killing two birds with one stone. Or, as Serena put it, breaking two horns with one strike.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTZmNTE2OWVkOTRkNmRhODg5OGM4MWJlMTZlMGJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, these demons and their obsession with horn-based idioms!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzYyZTc0Y2ZmNzQ3M2ZhZTQ1YjU4MjEzNzI3MThi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia wasn’t convinced this would keep her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> embodiment a secret. There were too many people who saw </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. While the inferno blocked off their little area from the rest of the city, Amelia had still been seen floating in the air and Speaking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It wasn’t just the warriors and the earthlord but also the hundreds they had saved. Even though the Old Guards informed the lowlanders of the severe consequences for breaking the vow Amelia didn’t think it would take long until alcohol started to loosen someone's lips.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzA2MTliNzMzMTQ1YTk5ZGRhNmM5MzQ5OTc0NTJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I never imagined you had… you were…” Mel mumbled. The demon made all kinds of motions, from shaking her head to nodding to grabbing her horns in a very Serena-like fashion. Eventually, she gathered her composure, turning to Amelia and slamming her fist against her open palm. “All this means is that I must train even harder to overtake you! Yes…” Mel nodded with a serious expression. “Just you wait!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTdiNWQ4ZjI3YTQ2YWM4ZDk0YmI0NWU5YzlmM2Q4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, Mel had become even more determined after seeing how amazing and cute Amelia really was! She would fit in well amongst the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> officer cohort, wouldn’t she?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTgwYWI1OTQxMDRjNTJiY2Q1NmQzN2ZhNjA5NzBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With vows of secrecy made, Amelia and Serena made their way towards Asamaywa Station. She hadn’t realised it, but the square in the centre of the inferno was only a small part of the greater firefighting efforts that had been taking place. Dozens of Speakers, backed by hundreds of warriors and mages, had worked tirelessly to build firebreaks and protect both the station and the plateau lifts. Even now, important-sounding figures shouted directions and coordinated efforts to manage the situation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTJhZTZhOTk0YzQyNWJiNzg4ZTQ4ZTU0NzAwYzdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost immediately, work began to clear the charred ruins of the slums. It was a welcome surprise to Amelia, who was used to large infrastructure projects taking years of planning in her old world before the first shovel of dirt was dug! All it took were a few orders from Greatlord Oshiro and the city of Asamaywa moved as one.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjFlZjlkZTY1YzQ4ODc4MDFlYWFkY2ZjNGYzOTM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Throughout the night, mages and warriors constructed makeshift shelters for the thousands who had been displaced. The mages employed earth magic to shape and manipulate the rock and soil beneath the skeletal remains of the slums, causing them to collapse to the ground, where warriors could lift immense quantities of debris and relocate them. The warriors also wielded large hammers, using their aura-enhanced strength to break through the buildings' walls.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjUyMzU3YzY0ODQxYzQ4YmI1NWRhZmRkOTEzYjgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hundreds of normal people joined the efforts, helping where they could. Groups from the Asamaywa Carpentry Guild and the Asamaywa Masonry Guild appeared, lending their expertise where needed. They often advised the mages and warriors on how to put pressure on a building to collapse it safely. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWY1ODUwMzNiNDQxNzQ4NTg2OTE0NWNiNzNhZGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not long after, officials in blue uniforms appeared. With a quick question, Amelia found out they were part of the Three Sisters Collectors Guild. Apparently, just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">collecting</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> moonstones was important enough to have an entire guild structure to manage it. They appeared as soon as the moonrain stopped and began their tasks. Each member would take a section of a street, and certain civilians from that street would be paid to assist the person in collecting all the moonstones on the ground and help find the ones trapped in trees, roofs and other nooks and crannies.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Mjc1NDBlMzlkNTQ5NzRiNzlhYWYyOTdmNjg0M2Y2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t take long for the streets to stop sparkling. They even had the legal authority to stop and search the workers in the slums. More than a few were fined for trying to pocket a few moonstones amongst the ruins. None were arrested, and most were given the option to work that fine off if they kept volunteering their time.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTE5MTNhMGZjZDRhYmZhY2VmMzM2MGY2Njc0ZTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia helped here and there, mostly healing people as they got tired. She wanted to be more involved, to help lift rubble and flatten ground, but it didn’t seem she was needed. Another time, she might have argued to help even more, but… </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWYwN2IyOTc0MjQ0MzZiOTdjYzIxMjU3NzU2ZTk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She felt tired. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzODI5NGRhM2Q1OTQ3YzViY2VjNjk1MjYxNTg5MmY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not physically tired. Or even mentally tired. It was something deeper. She felt like she’d once again stretched herself by invoking such a powerful Second-Word. Despite healing herself, she still wanted to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">rest</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It didn’t take long until she needed to step away from everything and soon she and Serena were sitting in the room of a nearby inn.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjIwNGIxYTlkOTQ5ODc4OWU3YWE4YjEyYjMwNzRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How are you feeling?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzkzMzI5MjQwZTQ1NDNhOGVlM2U0NDZmMjFlOGIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tired… and sad,” Amelia replied. That was right, she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">felt</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> sad. A part of her found it funny; what right did </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">she</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> have to feel sad when so many people had lost loved ones and everything they owned? Even so, as the night continued and morning came, seeing so many bodies being removed from the rubble made Amelia feel an overwhelming sadness at the entire event.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmVhNGUwMWY5YzQ5NzA4MGRkNmQwZDc1ZmRhYWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m worried the cause might have been the celebrations…” Amelia mumbled, twiddling her thumbs. Ah, she sounded pathetic, but she couldn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> share her thoughts with Serena. “You know… because of my healing.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjk4N2E2ZjU4MDQ3MGRhNTU0YjgzNjU5OWI1Yjhh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nonsense,” Serena stated firmly. “It was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">because</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of your healing that so many escaped! How many frail children or dust-addicted beggars did your healing fill with the strength to escape? Your actions not only saved hundreds </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">before </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">the fire but also hundreds </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">during </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">it.” Serena moved closer, putting an arm on Amelia’s back and rubbing it. “It’s easy to blame yourself. It’s your mind seeking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">reason</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in a place where there is none. Similar things happen on the battlefield.” Serena frowned for a moment. “Similar things have happened to me.” She continued rubbing her back. “It was a terrible fire that would have happened regardless. Don’t go thinking such unnecessary thoughts, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTYyM2Y3ZjE5ZTQ5ZjhhOWU0NzNhYjJiNjZlMmVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, her girlfriend really was the best.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjYwZWRlYjFhNzQ0NDlhZTM4NTdkYjM2ZGJiZGQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you,” Amelia replied. She looked out the window as the morning light continued to brighten the world outside. It was a shame. Serena once told her the morning after a moonrain was beautiful, where the Wilderness sparkled from all the crystals caught in the canopy. Unfortunately, they would have to wait until next time. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGNmMGVlMjcyYjQyNWU4YzJhMjUyY2FiY2I5OWJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can we… just lie here for a bit?” Amelia asked. “I want to close my eyes and try and think about nothing for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGYyZmVlMDNhNzQyYmVhMzZkOWEwYmJlY2M5MGYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjE1ZGZkMWFiZDQ4YTBhNDE4MTFlYjJiNWI2M2Ux" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena ensured the door was locked before grabbing some blankets and throwing them over Amelia. She then slipped in with her, wrapping an arm around and pulling her tight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTA1ODZmMjQ1MDQ5NGRhYmRhNDM2YzQ1YTEyOTM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia, despite everything, found herself smiling. She felt so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">secure</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Serena’s arms. Their closeness melted away all her troubles, and she soon felt her mind clear and her breathing slow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDE2ZjJjYzk2MjQ3NjdiNDRmYWQ2ODhhMzQ3Zjhj" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, even though she had recently healed herself, she fell asleep.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGE4NTQzNmYzYjRlNDBhODMyMmI2NjBlNTVkYjVj"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNzVkODA0YTNkMDQ0ZWE5ZTQ2ZDU2ZTNjZDAwYTdj"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTliZTlhYzk4MTQ4NGNhMzE2Y2U5OGRjNzE2ZjQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few days later, Amelia reunited with Kiku.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGU5ZGI2NDBkNzRiNDhhNjJmZjU1YWUxNDg1MWYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The young woman and the children had all been found and moved out of the slums before the fire had started. They’d been settling into a new house in the city when the moonrain began. Amelia’s instincts had been right; the Lord Guardian hadn’t broken his word. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjI0M2Y1N2UzMTQ3MGFhYWVkOTZjYjA4ODk4ZjRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The house was two stories and sandwiched between a florist and a milliner. It had no garden and was probably smaller in floor space than the orphanage, but the orphanage had only one functioning room anyway.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzM2NGZjMGZkMTRjOWU4MTk2OTI2OTQ5MDVhYmFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When the door opened and she saw the now healthy demon, Amelia couldn’t help but hug Kiku again. The children jumped for joy, and Amelia was equally happy to discover they had new clothes. They were still awfully skinny, but with better access to food, they would fill out in short order - she was sure of that!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2I5MThmZGQ4OTQ2MjBhMzNkZWIxZmY4NzhkZDcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about us,” Kiku said with a smile, her eyes shimmering slightly. “These clothes are worth more than what we lost in the fire, and they were given to us! That massive man said we’d even be given a weekly allowance as an apology for having to pay the guards’ protection fees! I mean…” she gestured around. “Look at this big house! What are we going to do with all these rooms!? We don’t even need to pay rent!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTQyMWM5OTU5OTQ0ZjBhNjdhNjA2NmIwZWIyOWI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite having enough bedrooms, many of the younger children had set up their beds in one room, with only the teenage children wanting the privacy of their own spaces. While being shown around they bumped into Noburu, who was organising the furniture in his and Kiku’s room. He jumped when he saw Amelia but seemed quite friendly otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTA2YmY4ZTI2ODRhODNhZWJiYzEwYzJhMGY5Y2Q3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve… signed a contract,” Noburu explained sheepishly. “I can stay here on the weekends but they’re putting me through an accelerated course at a cadet school. It's going to be tough, but I can do it because…” His voice became heavy with emotion, and he bowed and said, “You did what I couldn’t! You healed my sister!” A tear fell, splashing against the wood.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjM1YThhM2FjNDQ0ZDRiZmFmOTEzNjU2MDViZjNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t cry, Noburu!” one of the children shouted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWFmMGM4YmNiZjQ2Yjk4ZGM0MDM1OWE2N2RjYWY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! Everything’s alright now!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWQ5NDM2MjE5YTRmMjFiN2UzN2I1ZmY3N2EwNGIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re not cold anymore! Or hungry!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzMwOWE1YmExYTQ4ZGY5NTgzYzk3ZDY3NzVhZjYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love the city!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmNmNTE1ODlmMjQ3ZmRhYjhjYzkwNTJkNjVhYTQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lady Amelia,” Kiku began awkwardly. “Or is it Lord-Prospect? No, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Saint-</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTNhMzRhZDE1NDQyMGNiMTMxZTEyODhlZmIzNzdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia’s fine!” Amelia chirped quickly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGM3YjgwZGQ4NTQ3YTliMjNhMjc0NmYxZDFlZjA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay!” Kiku nodded with a serious expression as if she’d been bestowed a sacred privilege. “I just wanted to ask…” the demon glanced at her brother. “Please look after him!” she burst out. “He said he has to serve for a minimum of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">two</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> years! They told him he’d be serving under the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hellfire Captain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! They said you sail with her, so I was hoping you could protect him and ensure he wouldn’t be…” Kiku lowered her voice. “...harmed by her.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWUwZTI5YzFmZjQ2YTRiOTY0ZDU3MDBjNWYyMmI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Harmed by her?” Amelia asked, frowning.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTM3YmZlNGRjZTRiYjViZjYwNDlmZjllNjdkYjg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know…” Kiku looked around awkwardly. “They say the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hellfire Captain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> hangs anyone who steps out of line! She whips anyone bloody and dangles them from the ship as a warning to the rest of the fleet! They say the ship’s haunted with the ghosts of those who displeased her!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjg2YjAyOTQ4YzQ1NTQ4OTNlYTNlMjQwNjllYjQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena! This is what you get when you keep glaring at everyone!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmFlYTJjNTRmOTQ3NjQ4YzI4MjA0ZGVmMzFjMDdj" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kiku, do you know who the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hellfire Captain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjFkMjRmOTk4MTQ4OTRhNmQzZWIxYmY2NzMyNmY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWUwOTgxMzk5YTRjOTg4Y2FjYzhjNWEwNTVhZjRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia shook her head, giggling. Honestly, was this how much rumours twisted as they made their way mouth to mouth, all the way down to the slums? “You remember Lord Halen?” she asked. “The one who made all those guards shit-” Amelia coughed, glancing at the children. “I mean, the one who made all those guards so scared and obedient? The one who saved you? Who was so kind to you and the children?”</span></p><span class="cjg5NjE0N2U1NGExYTQ1NDJiNWY4ZDUzZDcxNTdiZmQx"><br/>This narrative has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road.

<p class="cnNmZjM1ZGY4Y2VjZTRhMDQ4NjM3YjUzNGU4ODI0MjA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiODVjYThhMDk2NTQ5YTc4NWY1MGNkM2U3ZGQ1ZjBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She was so pretty!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjRjM2U4YzlhZTQ2Nzg4MTFhM2E2NzY2ZjYyZWNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I liked her horns!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDIyZmYwYzNiOTRiODg4ZmQ5NTY4ZTgzMjIzMjA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She saved us with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">aura!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2Y5ODM3ZTYyZTQ2MjA4NzVlMGI0ZjgyZGQ3ODlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah?” Kiku started.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWNhY2NkMzU0ZDRiNmViZDUxZmI3MjEyY2FlNDZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hellfire Captain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!” Amelia explained. “And I assure you, she’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">fair and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">accepting! She hasn’t been flaying or hanging anyone while I’ve been travelling with her!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTQ1MTkzNzFiMDQzZGI4ZmVhZTEzZDY3ZDUyZjZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, they did hang all those mutineers. But Serena was unconscious then, so it didn’t count as her action, right?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmM1ODUxZTRhYzQwNzJhNjFjM2NjYzJmMWNiODM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh… oh!” Kiku exclaimed with a shocked expression before bowing to Amelia. “I’ve insulted your friend! I’m so sorry, Lady Amelia! Please, I didn’t know! I would never think such things of our saviour! Lord Halen was so magnificent and noble! Now you mention it…” Kiku paused. “...She was in that uniform, wasn’t she? Oh, what a fool I was!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmI5ZGUwNTNjMzQzZDdiMjY5YTQzNjE5NDEyNGRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don't worry!” Amelia pulled Kiku into another hug. “Lord Halen is a good captain!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDU2OGIwNDM5OTQ5MDhiMzE4MDMwNjU2MmU0NjQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“L-lady Amelia…” Kiku spluttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDNjNjM3ZmNmODRmOWM5NzI3MDA1MGZiZWQ0Y2Q3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just Amelia, remember!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjExZTUxYzRkNjQ1NGM5ZDVjYjlhODQ2MzhlYjA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia… you… like hugging, don’t you?” Kiku asked softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGJlM2Q2YzI1OTQ2YzRiOGMxMTg1ZTY3ZTZkMGZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A critical attack!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWYwMGExYTgzNDQwNmY5OTUzOTQzNWQxNTJmMTgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“J-just…” Amelia stammered. “We’re friends! And friends hug all the time, don’t they!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTJmZTJmZjU2YTQ4YjlhZTU2MzdlYjAyYWNhY2Ji" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do… do they?” Kiku tilted her head innocently. “I wouldn’t know; I haven’t lived in the city…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjNmZjM5ZmM2ZTRmZjQ4OWQ0OTc0YzhjNDFkMWI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They do! They definitely do!” Amelia defended her actions, lest someone spread rumours about her being a serial hugger! “Don’t worry about it! Anyway…” her mind fought to change the subject. “How are you feeling? You still feel healthy?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTY4NjNjMGMwNTQ5NzE5OWI4ZmY1YzEyMjM3ZWI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!” Kiku beamed. “I have to report to the guards if I want to go out, but other than that, I can run around the house all day! I’m so happy to have my </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">movement</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> back! I never thought it would happen, but it did! All thanks to you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTJkZThkNzE2YzQ3NTc4MmZlMTdkYjNkODc4YmU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re welcome!” Amelia replied. “If you ever become seriously ill again, I’ll come and heal you again! I promise!” she held out her pinky. “This is a pinky promise! It’s city etiquette between ladies. An unbreakable vow! Come on, give me your little finger!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWM2YzVjOTU3ZTQ4N2RiZWU2NzEyMTg1NzA2OGE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTAzNzg2MjZjMTQ5ZGM5MTAyZWU5MWRkNmJhMTIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They joined pinkies and shook on it while the children laughed and cheered, repeating the phrase ‘pinky promise’ like a rallying cry.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGY1MGIxZjAxZjQ4OTU4YjIyY2NlM2FlYTFkMmE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s with the noise?” a voice intoned. Amelia turned to see a familiar woman in the doorway. The woman raised an eyebrow. “The human?” she questioned before her eyes widened a little. “The one who healed you, Kiku?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWNjNGJjZjY2MTRhMDU5OTg5M2FhZjBkZDZmY2Yy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Seonmi’s first time seeing Amelia, but Amelia had watched Seonmi through the one-way glass for a long time, seeing her in her most vulnerable state. The demon didn’t know how to behave around Amelia. Amelia wasn't sure whether that was because she was a human or a lord-prospect. After a minute of awkward conversation, Seonmi retreated to her room.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmRjM2FkMzFiODQwZGRiOTYwNjk0Y2M3YzJmYTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s also taking the cadet course with me,” Noburu explained.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmY2MDJiY2U2MjQ0YjViMTY1ZjA1MzcyNmZlNzQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded. “I can’t wait to sail with you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWM2MjViNjkxMTQyYTJhYTNmYzM4NjJmMmYzNjc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They chatted till it was time for Amelia to leave.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWUwZDBhMzU5YjQxOWI4YWI5MDA1NzYyZTE2MzE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She headed down to the lowlands, trying to ignore the civilians who would stop and bow in her direction. It was a little strange to receive such attention. For what? For doing what anyone would do if they had the power? On one occasion, an adorable little girl with a toothy smile ran up to her and gave her a red flower. Amelia took it and used it as a hair accessory, which made the little girl squeal in delight and run back to her mother, bouncing with the endless amounts of energy only children have.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTVkZGZkZGI3YjRkYTY4YjkwZmZhNmJkZDRjNWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She heard the phrases ‘Golden Healer’ and ‘Saint Amelia’ a dozen times, whispered in hushed tones, often followed by a quick prayer. She thought being called a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">saint</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was a little silly, but it was somewhat understandable. Her acts of healing were a never-before-heard phenomenon in the Empire. Still… regardless of what they called her, whether it was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Saint</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">… she was still just Amelia! </span></p>
<p class="cnM1Mjk3N2VhZjhjNzQ5YzU5MTlkMmY4OTk1MzYzOTk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No more, no less.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2UzNDM2MjY0YjRlMTI5MDA4Mjg5NTQzMGMzN2U5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thunk</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the lift arrived at the lowlands, belching steam as if announcing her arrival. Amelia used her aetherflow to track down Serena. Her girlfriend was in one of the temporary tents set up to organise the rebuilding efforts. She was sitting in a chair with perfect posture, reading.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmQwMDRmZDVhYjQwMGE5MmZjOTBhZjZiODM4MWIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello,” Amelia said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmQyY2ZkY2FhZDRjMGY4OWM3OTY4ZWZhNDg5NTYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm,” Serena answered, her attention focused on the book.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTg3OTRkNjllNTQ3NGQ4NTdjYzk1YjNkZmMxODFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia had discovered a new side to Serena recently: that of the studious demon. While Serena volunteered her time in the lowlands in case her yellow aura was needed to clear a troublesome piece of rubble, she spent much of it with her nose buried in books on fleet tactics and logistics.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTNkOGZiNjg2YzQ1YWNhOTc3Y2Y2Zjc4YjE3YTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her commodore examination was due to be held in eight weeks, just before they were due to leave Asamaywa to lands unknown. Serena had been using every waking minute to study and Amelia had caught her skipping lunch on more than one occasion to spend more time in the library.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjA2ZjAxNGY0MzQ1ZTA5Nzk3NzdhMjM2NDcyYzdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it weird to find her girlfriend so attractive when she was just reading a book?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzM1NDJlMDI4NzRhNTliYjJhMzlkNDdiZDBiODVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re staring,” Serena muttered, the edge of her mouth curling up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTIyYzkwMjE2ZTRmNzQ5NjczNDU5ZDc5ZTk0Zjc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry,” Amelia said with a grin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWUxYWNlODVlNTQ0MWE5NmUzMWJhZGI3MDgwNmQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How were the children?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmI0ZGQzYjMyZDQ5NWI5NzY5MWE2NTQ5OGNiOWQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re doing good!” Amelia nodded. “The kids said you were pretty!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2QxM2ExYjI2YzQzZTk5MTgyMmVlOWVmYmI0YjUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did they now?” Serena hummed, acting as if she didn’t care, but Amelia didn’t miss the subtle signs. Honestly, how could anyone give her softy girlfriend a scary nickname like the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hellfire Captain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? Give her a compliment or two, and she was putty in your hands!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmMyZTdjNDM1ZjQwZTI4ODVhOGJhYjZmYWJlMzBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I spoke to Highlord Yasuda,” Serena mumbled. “The investigators have finished their work. They say the fire started at a bakery. Embers from an oven improperly put out. The baker died in the fire, so there’s no punishment to give out.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTYyNjI0NjM5OTQ1NTNiYThlOTNmY2NlNGE0YTli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh,” Amelia answered. “All that from a few embers?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2U1MTQ0MWJjZjQ3YzdiNDA4NWM3OWVlOGIyZWMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The largest things can be started from the smallest flame.” Serena locked eyes with Amelia before her mouth curled into a knowing smile. “I would know.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjE0YTk3ZTY3MjQzMzhiMGYxNjhmMmMxN2UzY2Iy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now it was Amelia’s turn to blush.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmZlYWY4ZTRmZDRlNDI4NGIyNmNjMjQ2ZTk1NDU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then!” Amelia announced cheerfully. “I’m going to go and help the earth mages with the foundation work! I think they’re building new flood channels!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTkyNWZhZTM3ODRiOTNhNGE5NDg3ZGRiNjkzMmM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t take all the credit; let them do their part!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2M1MDhmMDhkNDRmYzc5MTdmOGFjOTk4NmViMjBk" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Of course!” Amelia tutted with mock annoyance before spinning around and exiting the tent.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmE1NmU2NWRiYTQwZDBhNGZhNmMxYzMxMzBhZWJk"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYzAxYzQwNTdkMjRkMWFiM2MxY2I2ZDljYmJjNDU2"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjU2NDBjZGMyNzQ5NzBhNzkxZTZmY2E1OTljNjYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the days ticked by, Amelia fell into a satisfying routine.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmI3NTNjZDc4ZTRiNzM4NGZmOTYwY2YzYWEwZWNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She would wake and either go and meet Serena for some early morning training, or they would attend Katalin's bi-weekly sessions. The Northern demon was steadily increasing the intensity of the sessions, and Amelia was sure she was developing some genuine muscle from them!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWYxMTdhNDg5MzQ3MTViYmM2NWY5MzllNTZhZDZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Duels are simple, yes?” Katalin said one session after a drill. “But rarely are things so fair. Those who served on the frontlines will know what I am referencing, mmm?” At her words, most of the instructors nodded in understanding.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmNlNjUxOWIxMjQzM2U5MDVlNGIzZTQ0NWQxYjgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The best way to kill an enemy is to outnumber them, and the best way to be killed is to be outnumbered. The humans know this and so do we. We will now learn how to control the battlefield in such unfair conditions. Now, all of you…” Katalin’s eyes gleamed as she unsheathed her sword. “Attack me.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjc4MjFhNWZhMDRlNTRhYWI2ODEwODRhMDgzNzA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took a moment for the class to register the request before the first handful surged forward, followed by the rest. They did their best to swarm Katalin. No matter how good she was, no one would be able to defend themselves if they were surrounded, right?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2Y2OTUyYTlkMDQzZjI4MWEyYzM3ZWZmYTdjNDdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They didn’t find out because no matter how much they tried, Katalin moved around the room in such a way she was only ever within sword-reach of one or two people. It was almost as if she were controlling their movements, somehow understanding exactly how the attacking class would respond as a group and using this knowledge to her advantage to cause people to bump into each other and trip.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2RiZmU2Yzk0YjRkNTM5ZGE5NDVmNWM3MzMxOWY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The instructors eventually figured out how she was doing it and quickly began to counter, splitting into small, independent groups. However, this didn’t help much. Katalin changed tactics, going on the offensive and demonstrating how individual groups could be broken apart by pushing, tripping, and throwing demons at one another.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWYxNzBlMmExMTQyNzlhNTI4ZDgwZTU0ODMyYmRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That day, the reputation of Katalin of Driss as a swordmaster was set in concrete in the minds of the humbled Eastern instructors. Amelia tried her best to absorb the lessons but knew it would take years of practice to fully understand what Katalin was teaching. She could understand how she eclipsed everyone else, even those famous for their contributions to the war. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTk1NjRmNDE1MDQzYzRhMzUzZTVlZGE1Y2Q1ZTM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Who would win between her, the grandmaster, and Greatlord Oshiro? The grandmaster had a sense of brutal efficiency, developed from decades of honing his skills. Greatlord Oshiro had a dominating </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">presence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">; when he entered a room, everyone naturally deferred to his superiority.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjZhMWUwNDdkMzRhYzg4NWMxMmFkNDk5YTIwODVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">So, who would win? Maybe she would ask Serena’s opinion later, but if Amelia’s theory were correct, Katalin would only lose if she wanted to.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTZmMDliNGJmYjQ1NzBhZGFmN2RhNDZkNzY5YTVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While Amelia was pushed to her limits in Katalin’s session, she and Serena continued their joint training sessions with their disciples. Serena would train the Northerner, Flakken Holm, and the two excitable lowland-born siblings, Ido and Arin Song. Amelia kept assisting Hinako, but after one session, she was approached by the student mage named Daichi. He was the most promising second-year student, with solid third-circle magic, and was the one who had been so arrogant towards her when she duelled his entire class in a row - defeating them one by one.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTAxN2YzYzUyYjRhMDI5OTMyZTAyNTBiNTE3YmY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assistant Instructor Thornheart,” Daichi politely bowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDNjZDI1NzQ0YzRlNDE4M2EzOWYwYjdkY2Y4NGY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Daichi Ishitani,” Amelia intoned, having long since memorised everyone’s name. “How can I help?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjdiY2ZiZDJkNTQyNjliNGYxMjI4MmQyZTQ1OGYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have heard you’ve been assisting the lowland construction efforts,” he began tentatively. “With your earth magic. I’ve been told it is unique and more efficient than most. I was hoping you would allow me to learn from you.” He punctuated his request with a bow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjQ5NTVkMzEyMTRhM2RhZmU1OWU5MTg1Y2RiMWI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And what kind of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">learning</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> were you hoping for?” Amelia asked, folding her arms.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDhhNzlhMjAyMDRhMTVhNWI4NGMzOTkzNzMyNWJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I believe allowing me to witness your magic up close would give me new insights. If you could point out inefficiencies in my magic, that would be desirable. I would also like to duel against your… first-circle wards again.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWJhNzNkMzE5ODRiMDFiZDYyOWZmNGUxMjI4ZTlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the previously arrogant demon had turned a new leaf. After thrashing him in the duel he’d always held a glint of hostility in his eyes. Now, Amelia's intuition informed her that hostility had significantly lessened. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGZhZTllOGU0NTRjMTNiYzEzOGM1Y2YzMzAxZmY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Had he finally accepted how amazing and cute she was!? </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTk5YTg3OTQ4ZDRjMWRhNTdmMGU4YzRlNmMxZDhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It made sense. He would know about her invoking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and would have calculated her aether capacity from the readings of her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sphere of Convalescence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Even if the demon was predisposed to racial elitism and possessed a tendency for arrogance, he couldn’t deny the reality before him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzk5NzViODNmNzQ3Nzc5YjRiOWE4NGU1ZWU0YjNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One question…” Amelia began. “Why haven’t you volunteered your talents in earth magic in the lowlands? You would be a great addition to the construction teams.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTJiNGZmZWYxZDQ3NTJhY2ZkY2U5NDk0NWM3NTIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That…” Daichi frowned. “Construction work is… eh…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTAxZjU5NTI0MjQyOTk4ZWNkOTczZDk2YjAzYjE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Construction work is?” Amelia said, pressing him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDI2MzI0MzRhZDQ3MWM5MDgxM2FhYTQ4MjkyZDMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My family consider it to be…” Daichi swallowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzM5ZGQwYWM2NTQ3YWY4MTlmOGM4NjM2NDA3ZjIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia didn’t let him escape.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWQ5ZDcwNGJhMDRlYTg5NGVlYTFmNTlhNDU0YTQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Considers it to be what?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWI3NzZhM2ZhMzQwNmM5ODAzYzRjMzI3OGZmMzU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena had stopped directing her group and was watching her with amusement. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDA0OWM5NzU4ODRmZDY4NGU1MWQxZDEzYzJhZjgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope you’re proud!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I learned this from you!</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMwYmJlM2YxZmI2ZDQ3ZmVhMDc5YmQ3NDVhNjkwZDFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The art of making someone squirm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzdjNTU5YzJkMDQ0MDc4MmY2ZWIwMWI3NWZhMDUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Consider it to be…” Daichi’s voice became small. “...lesser work.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDIwZjA4ZWE0YTRkOGNiNDYzZDU0Yjg5MjcwMzI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh?” Amelia placed a finger on her chin. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lesser</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> work? For… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lesser </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">people?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWRjNzgxOTQwOTQzZTA5OGVhYjEwZmZmMzYxMDdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmFkMjYzNGYzZDRmOWZhYzI3ZTBmZDFlYTJiNWVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does that mean you consider me to be a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lesser</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> person?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTg4ODA3YzcwNjQ1YWU4ZWYyMzI5NDY3YmJkNWY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not at all, Assistant Instructor Thornheart!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDI5M2JiODk0ZTQ4YjhiZTRlZDZkZjk0MzFhYzBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">noble</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Empire</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Amelia said, enjoying emphasising each word. She wasn’t actually annoyed, so it was okay to re-educate him a bit, wasn’t it? “Do you know what that means? It means I am to work for the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Empress</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, to aid her in building a prosperous world for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">all </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">demons!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDQxMmQxNjZlZTQ1ZjdhOWU2ZTA4ZDU1ZTQxMGZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">And humans</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she added in her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTczMGQyMWMyODRmOWJiOTRlZWU1ZTNlNDEzNTk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So how can it be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lesser</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> work to help provide homes for thousands of demons who struggle to feed and warm themselves through winter? Can you explain that, Daichi Ishitani?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTkwNTk1YjJiMDRmNGRiZDI5YmRmYzhmNDA0MmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My way of thinking has changed, Assistant Instructor! I now see the error of my ways!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDA2NWU4Yzk0NDQ4MDhiNDZjNjljNWU5ODM0NmQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That easy!? Amelia was surprised. This Serena-style re-education thing </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">worked</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWY4N2ViYWE4YzQwYzA4MmMwODY2ZTVhODE5NTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent, then you can come to the next training session!” Amelia declared.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGM2ZDUxNmIyYTQ1NjZiODE1ZjRmZjc2YTc3MWQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Assistant Instructor!” Daichi bowed again, his eyes full of genuine appreciation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDNkZWQ3NDZmMDRkZjJhOWY5NmY1OWIzZmJmNjY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But there’s a condition.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjg3NGUyNGVmOTQzNTI5ZDAxMjhmMzg0N2M2NjNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTNiY2QxN2FjYzQ5N2Y5YmJmNGZlNDA3ZjhiZGNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll only help you train if I see you in the lowlands, assisting with the construction work.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGE5NjZjMDcxYTQwODA4OTM0NzE0MWExNGU0OGVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia saw Serena bite her tongue in the background. While her girlfriend kept control, Ido and Arin Song laughed loudly. As lowlanders themselves, it must be cathartic to see Amelia tease Daichi so much.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjQzNmVmOGE1MjRlMTc5NjgyNDIwMTM1ODdmZmQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And with innocent encounters like that.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzRlNmNlM2VkZDRkNDFiNjAzNWZkZGJiNjc4YzEy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">A month passed.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMyYTFjMWY5MzdlMjRjMjNiNTJhMGQwZWVlY2I2YWZk"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjk0MDk1NWFmYTRkNGViZjRmMDcyNzk2NTY1NmZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t take long for the city to return to its usual ebb and flow. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzIzYjE3ZmQ3NjRlMTg4MDA3NDkxYTE5YWZmYTMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few weeks, the broadsheets stopped reporting on the event, and photographs of Amelia’s embodiment of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> were no longer sprawled across the front pages. Instead, with the capital of the Republic, Meppen, fallen, the war retook its usual spot in the headlines. Every night, celebrations could be heard lasting until the early hours of the morning. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzE2ZTE3NjQ1MTRjM2VhZmZjZmYwNWVkZGYxNGFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena heard it talked about everywhere, from the students to the instructors to the shopworkers and their customers; the war was ending.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2EwOTUxZmQ5ZjRlOTRiMGVhNDJlYjZkMTg4NjAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After a month, the fire was a distant memory to the citizens of Asamaywa.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDg4MWZkYWRiYjRlZDlhMDk3NjZiOGViZmZlNTg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The construction effort was moving along well. The work of the earth mages was finished, and the bulk of the remaining tasks were contracted to various companies under the umbrella of the Asamaywa guilds. Steam-driven cranes littered the lowlands, each one replacing the work of an aura user, and hundreds of civilian workers buzzed around the site, fulfilling their roles diligently.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWFhMTg3MjY4NjQ0MGE5MzAzNTQ4OTljMmJiOGMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia had stopped coming down, but only at the behest of Serena, the academy, and Greatlord Oshiro himself. Over the last month, the face and name of Lady Thornheart of the Lowlands had become so well known that Amelia began needing a protection squad when travelling. Not because she was in danger but because the citizenry would constantly approach her, delaying her schedule again and again. Most citizens were polite, simply wanting to pay their respects, but many tried to persuade Amelia to heal them or their loved ones with a story of sorrow and pain.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzQ3ZWExYmMxMjQwZDA4MDFiYTkzYTYzYTBhZDM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been hard, but Serena had convinced Amelia </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to heal everyone who approached her with an ailment. Serena emphasised that if she did, she would never be able to walk freely; she would be mobbed wherever she went. Sure, Amelia could disguise herself with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaxai</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> spellwork, but then her freedom would always come at the cost of never being able to truly be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">herself</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmU3MDkxMGY0MDQ2ZGViMmE0MGFmZDZkYWUzNTQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While Amelia agreed, she explained very clearly that she wouldn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">refuse</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to heal anyone on that principle; she just couldn’t bear to see the suffering she’d seen in the lowland slums. If, in her words, the Greatlords of the East didn’t want her causing political problems, then they should fulfil their duties in ensuring the bottom rung of society could at least </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">survive</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTFjZDA5YjUwNTQ4NTViMTU0NWVlZTg3NDhiY2Fi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s tone had been angry saying that. Even so, Serena couldn’t find it in her heart to correct her. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmQzZjM5NmYzYjRmNjZhMWU4ZjY4MWVjZTU2Y2Ey" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The slums had been far worse than she could ever have imagined. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzA2YjQzYWM1NzRjNGI4MzVjMzc0NDEyMzljZjAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Kanamori had been quietly removed from his position as Lord of Asamaywa Station and its surroundings. He hadn’t had his lordship revoked but was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">encouraged </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">to relocate to his new territory, a minor mining village somewhere in the mountains.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTI5MDE0ZWM3ZjQ5YTdhZDgyZTMyNDgxYThiMzdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Essentially, he was exiled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTdlZWEwZjc3OTQ5OGFiNTMzZDVhZTgzNDkxMmJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And, if the rumours were true, his wealth had been seized to contribute to the reconstruction under the guise of a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">donation</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was a tactful amount of political manoeuvring that left a sour taste in Serena's mouth. If an officer under her had demonstrated even a fraction of Lord Kanamori’s corruption, she would have them hanged.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzQwNzVmOTg3YTRhZWY4YjI5NTEzY2JjNzJlZTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it was understood that if Amelia was restricted too heavily, she would likely just do another chaotic healing event anyway, an agreement was made so that she would repeat another mass healing event before they left Asamaywa. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGY1MDdjNzE5NTQzMmE5NDA1ODBiOTA4ZTIxYzAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">To minimise intra-Empire political fallout, Cascadian Lords from all corners were invited to the event. Greatlord Oshiro explained that the Overlord was being careful and had weighted the invitations proportionally across the Empire. Serena understood it as a delicate balancing act; the East wanted to maximise Amelia for themselves but couldn’t be seen as trying to hoard her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDAxYzJkOWQ3NDRiZWQ5N2FiMGQxNzE0YTllMGEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">According to an aethergram her Father received from Nina, more than a hundred Centralis-registered ships had requested travel visas for the Three Sisters, and hundreds more were waiting for paperwork. With all the public docks in the Three Sisters booked until the event, people resorted to getting travel routes approved for the nearby Nai and even Nachon, where they would get a train or shuttle to Asamaywa.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzJmZjA1MDU0NTQ2ZGNiM2Y5NDc4ZmE1NzdiM2Jm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The prices of accommodation and private docking space had increased by more than a magnitude. This wasn’t just due to people desperate to receive Amelia’s healing; many wanted to witness the event for bragging rights.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODcyN2Y1NmVmNTQxZTc5YmFlYWRkODA2YTYzNzQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia didn’t like the sound of people being charged up to their horns for just a chance to see her. Still, her complaints stopped when Greatlord Oshiro pointed out that the increased revenue - from what Serena was calling </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia tourism -</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was paying for the lowland to be rebuilt.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDAyZDFkOTc2ODRiNzhiMGVlNGNlOTQyNGQ0Mjhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The topic has caused more than a few heated arguments in the House of Commons,” Greatlord Oshiro explained one day at his estate. He had been summoning both Serena and Amelia frequently over the weeks. They stood in an ornate reception room with paintings of landscapes and flowers decorating the walls. It was a room made for the occupants to feel relaxed. “The delegations have nearly come to blows on more than one occasion,” Greatlord Oshiro continued.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzM1NGNiZjY5MjQ3MmE5NDkxMDI5ZGFiYzU2Zjdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How does the rest of the Empire view Amelia?” Serena asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzUxNmY5ZmNkYjQyMGY4YzRmODg0NjRlNjE0NGJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Centralis is… welcoming. The North isn’t. Sentiments built up over the war will take time to cool. They don’t like a human taking such a prominent position in the Empire.” Greatlord Oshiro glanced at Amelia standing nearby, who just shrugged in response. “The South believe Amelia was behind the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> embodiment and aren’t happy the East has a claim to such a large part of their heritage through a human.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmE3ZWNmOTQ5MDRkMWRiZDdhZTUzMWMxOGQ2NDg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They… know?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmIzN2Y5NzM1ZDRiYTFhYzUxNWRjNDg1OTZmODMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An intelligence document was leaked to the North. It was presented in parliament.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmUxZGExMjg5ZTRmZjhiNzY2Yzc4NzA0OGFiMTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She frowned. “They just let that happen?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTk1MzMxY2VlYTQxODhhN2EzZTM5Y2JkMDk0MWM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve never attended parliament, have you, Lord Halen?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzFiNTlkZTJkNzQ5NTk5ODYzYjAyNWIxY2ZkNjFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.” As a Cascadian Lord, Serena had a right to attend the House of Lords and make her voice heard. Typically, it wouldn’t be done without the permission of their Lord Superior, but occasionally, a Lord might bypass the normal etiquette as a form of protest if they think their Lord Superior wasn’t listening to them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTI4MzE1NTE5ZTQ2MjBhMjA2YjE0ZDE1MmJlOTYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Both Houses have the same rules in that they cannot prevent a member from sharing information. The Northern delegation got part of the early report that named Lord-Prospect Thornheart as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin’s </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzJiNWFkMDVlYjQ3YzhhOGIyNjIyMzZlNWM4NjNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it possible Intelligence leaked it intentionally?” Amelia asked, blinking innocently.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTk1ZjExNWM3NTQ4Y2JhMGFhYTE0ZmE1Y2U4MjVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps,” Greatlord Oshiro answered. “But the papers won’t report on it. They know they need permission to reveal a Speaker’s name. Someone may want this information to filter back to the human continent. I can see it cooling the temperament of the human nations. For a while, at least.” He was silent for a moment, then continued, “Still, our official position is to deny the allegation, so I expect you both to do the same.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDkzMTIwMTk3NDQ1YWVhMTllZTlhYTU2MmQwMmJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay!” Amelia chirped.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDNjNDMyMjQ0ZTRiMTdhYTQ2Njc5NTZlOTIyOWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Greatlord,” Serena intoned with a bow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDdiZjVjZjEwMzRjMzVhMTkxYWQyNWVmYmJhZDI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is something else,” Greatlord Oshiro said, producing two letters. “There will be an award ceremony for those who risked their lives or otherwise contributed greatly to putting out the fire. I’m sure it shouldn’t be surprising for either of you to find out you’ll be awarded. Here.” He passed the letters over, and after seeing his affirmative nod, Serena opened hers and read it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2U4YTFiODczMDQ0M2FhZjhjNDg1OGIyN2JhNzQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A… Gold-” Serena swallowed and tried again. “A Golden Horn?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDhlMzBjNDhiMDQ2NGNhYjg3M2YyZjY1YjM3MGM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Greatlord Oshiro stated. “One hundred and thirty Bronze Horns, Forty Silver Horns and eight Golden. Two of which are going to you two.” He frowned. “It’ll be a long ceremony. You’ll be going last.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzRkN2U0MjYwNTRmNmJhNmY2ODEyNTFjOGMzNGM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s a Golden Horn?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjliMThkYzdkMTQwZWFhODA1ZGVlZjZkM2E3OTY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s the highest civilian award in the East,” Greatlord Oshiro explained. “It entitles you to a modest yearly sum for ten years and to own land in Asamaywa Proper. As a Lord-Prospect, you already have that right, of course. If such a reward feels insufficient…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjFhYTM0NzkwMzQ0YzBiZTBjMGRjYTM2M2VhZmJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia began shaking her head.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“...then know this Golden Horn will only be for your miraculous healing that saved the lives of so many. We can’t reveal your role in Speaking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> but we can reward you for it. So,” the greatlord cleared his throat. “Lord-Prospect Thornheart, for saving Asamaywa Station by extinguishing that terrible inferno… you’ll be awarded a modest estate in the city.” Greatlord Oshiro politely coughed. “It comes fully furnished, so you’ll be able to move in the moment the paperwork is signed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2MwNWNhMGVhMjQ3MWNiZjc0MmMyYTAyZWU5MmEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you’re giving me a house!?” Amelia’s eyes grew as wide as a peeka spotting a mouse. “Thank you!” She bowed deeply. “Thank you!” She turned to Serena. “Did you hear that? A house! All for me!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTlhN2ZiOTNkYzQ1OTdiNTUxMDRlMGIwMTRjMTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena couldn’t help but smile at Amelia’s enthusiasm, but something Greatlord Oshiro said made her suspicious. After all, fully furnished estates don’t spring up out of nowhere. This award was either planned in advance or it was…</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzRiZTQwMDVlYzQxOWNiNTgzZWQ0N2E5ZGJmNDIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord Oshiro, this estate,” Serena began tentatively. “It wouldn’t happen to be…?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWMyZDViZDhhMzQ5NWY4NjI1YjBkNTI1ZGM3YTcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Kanamori’s previous holdings, yes.” The greatlord nodded. “Lord-Prospect Thornheart contributed more to the lowlands in one night than Lord Kanamori ever did in years. Awarding her his seized estate is as much a symbolic gesture as a worthy award. You won’t inherit his staff, so I would encourage you to find some replacements to manage and guard the property while you’re away from the city. I’m sure Lord Halen here can give you some good recommendations.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDVhNDU3YzdlNjQyZTY4Y2M2MmJkYWRhMWY2MWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia couldn’t stop grinning. “Thank you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTgyNWU3MmQ4MTQ5ZGViZTNkMzU5MWNjODdiZGQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It might have been a trick of the light, but for a moment, Serena swore the greatlord’s mouth curled slightly. It seemed that even he wasn’t immune to Amelia’s infectious cheerfulness.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWY4NTYzNjUzNDQxYWQ5NmFkNGJjY2RhMTg2NzYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wear something formal for the ceremony, and…” Greatlord Oshiro produced a necklace Serena immediately recognised, for she wore something similar around her own neck. “Wear this as well. There will be clergy representatives there, and if they see you wearing the symbol of the demon church as opposed to the human one, it’ll make our lives much easier and silence a large part of those opposing your appointment as Lord-Prospect.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDIzYjQzMTAwMzRjMWRhYmRkNjJhYjQ1ZjViMmUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay…” Amelia frowned a little but took the necklace. “Anything else I need to know?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODdkZWEzZDM3NDRhMTE5NDFjNGM5OTg3YzQ1ZTZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord Oshiro discussed the ceremonial procedure with Amelia for a few more minutes before requesting that she leave so he could discuss a few matters in private with Serena. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGM2YjYyNzZkYzRkYTZhNjgzYjZhMzNmYmM4OWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once Amelia had bowed and cheerfully stated, “I’ll be waiting outside!” Serena and Greatlord Oshiro were alone.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjdkNzFjOWU3YTQ1OTFhYTYyZTdhYzhiMzcyMjM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tea?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTMwZGQ4NmU1YzQ2Y2U4NzMwNzBkNzU5ZWEyYzhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena accepted. It would be rude not to. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjlhMmZiZmE4NzQzZWFiOTQ2MzNiNDM4ZTVmNWEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, an unusual fragrance filled the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWY1ZWVhZWEwZDRkODlhYTk2ZTI2Y2NkYjhiYTZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Manwese earth-tea,” Greatlord Oshiro explained, passing her a cup. “Please, sit.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWI4MjVkODcyMjQ5NTBiNTYyY2ZlOWQ2YzRjZTVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They both sat down on two couches, facing each other with a low table in between.</span></p><span class="cjI1NTA1OGVkOWIyOTRlMzM4OTg4ZDM4NmI1YTdhYjM3"><br/>Unauthorized reproduction: this story has been taken without approval. Report sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNhMGRlZWQ3OTkxYTQ3ZTVhYTRkODI2ZDcxN2UzNGNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena brought the cup to her mouth, smelling the tea. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzgzNmM3NTVlNzQzOGQ5NGUzZTQ3MDg1M2QxMzBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She tried not to wrinkle her nose.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmJmZTk1ZTMyODQ3NTU5MDY2MTM2MjljZTZkNTRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">earthy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWU2Yjg4MTQxZjQ2MWNhZTcxYmM4NTJiODU4ZTQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unpleasant, isn’t it?” the greatlord said with a smile, taking a slow sip. “It was recommended to me by the Lord Guardian. He assured me it would grow on me.” He took another sip before placing his cup down. “Perhaps you’ll have better luck. Nevertheless, we sometimes have to swallow unpleasant truths, don’t we?” He paused momentarily before asking, “How is your preparation?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTc2ZGM5YWRhNjRhNzZiZWRmYjgzZjc5ZWQyNjkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Preparation?” Serena questioned, taking a sip. The tea didn’t taste any better than it smelled. She placed the cup down.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjBiNzFhODJlZjRkOTk5MzRlNjU4NzdhMTU3NWRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For your promotion exam.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmZlZTUyMjQ5YjQzMjhhODI5NjkxNWUzYzVhNmU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh!” Serena raised a hand and coughed politely. “I’m dedicating a lot of my time to it, Greatlord. Between that, my obligations at the academy and training exercises with the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, I barely have enough time to sleep.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjIyOGM2MjU2ZjRiYzM4MmFjMGU4ZThiMGY4MGVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lucky for you then, to have Lord-Prospect Thornheart to heal away that tiredness.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjI5NjQzYzM5YjRhZjNiNDg4NTIxZTk3OGFjZmEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The moons have blessed me,” Serena intoned, lowering her chin humbly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTFjYzU2MWY2MTQ5NjBhYTJhZTI0NjM0MGVmZTBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A slightly too-long silence developed between them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWE1NjkxYmI1NjRiNTBiYWQxYTI2ZmQ3ZTk5YTlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Here it comes</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What he really wanted to talk about</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTkxMjMwMjEyOTQ5ZjliZjkzZjQ2ZWZiMWVkN2E3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s a realm-traveller, isn’t she?” Greatlord Oshiro asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDllOThmNGRjZDRiMjRiNWE5YjdhN2FkOGI0NjYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” Serena mumbled before clearing her throat. “I cannot say.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTIxOGUzODdmZDRkMGJiYWZiNzk0ZjlkZTM3NWQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Neither could Vikram when I asked him. His refusal was enough of an answer anyway, as was yours.” The greatlord picked up his cup of tea, taking a slow, unpleasant sip. “I always wondered why I was encouraged not to look into her background too deeply.” He chuckled to himself. “I was surprised when I realised. Such a far-fetched, insane conclusion that became more obvious the longer I entertained it. The human nations will likely figure it out, especially once the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> embodiment inevitably leaks.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmQyNDFiMjdmNzRmMmJiNWY2NGY4NWNkMTViYzBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What could she say? What </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">should</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she say?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Nzc3MTZjZjAyMTQ5YTZiZWVkNTI4MWM3NTU3ZGI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is strange, though,” Greatlord Oshiro continued. “It was always my understanding that there are divine accords that are supposed to prevent such-” He frowned as if trying to find the right word. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Anomalies</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> from happening. Regardless, we are lucky she fell into our hands and not our enemies’. With her vast power, backed by such an innocent and vulnerable personality, I dread to think how the war might have gone if she was turned against us.” His expression tensed before asking, “Do you know if she’s capable of the Third-Word? Has she given any indication either way?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmQ0MjA3OWIwNDQwZWFhZjIzYjIyMmFjYWI2NmI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Third-Word. The peak of divine communion. The power that allowed the Empress of Demonkind to defeat the Enemy and establish an Empire spanning the majority of the Cascadian continent. The power that created the Shattered Islands. The power of a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">demigod</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Serena knew little about what it actually entailed; even the details of how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Second-Word</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> embodiments worked was knowledge not easily accessible to the average person. Information regarding the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Third-Word</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was a closely guarded secret.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmZkYmY1OTE5OTQwOGU5OTI5YTVkZTMxNjliZmRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know…” Serena answered. “I don’t know where her limits lie. We’ve briefly spoken on the matter and she doesn’t seem to have any interest in even trying it.” Greatlord Oshiro seemed relieved to hear that, so she added, “She’s new to the Second-Word and she fears losing control or accidentally doing harm.” It was more or less the truth. Amelia told Serena that she could invoke the Third-Word in the game she played but wasn’t sure if it could be done in reality. “If I may…” Serena asked. “What do you know about the Third-Word, Greatlord Oshiro?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWE5NjE0NDI0NDQ0MDBhYjg1OGQwZTYwZGQ2OWFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a bold question for a Lord,” Greatlord Oshiro replied, his eyes narrowing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjM2MDIwMTE4YTQ4MzZiZjAyNjAxZmEyNWZlZDky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Forgive me, Greatlord.” Serena swallowed. “I was merely… curious.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmE0ZGYwNjEwZTQxNmRiMWU1OWJlOGVhYzI5ZjAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you want to know the answers, then serve our Overlord well and work your way up the hierarchy.” Greatlord Oshiro sniffed, tapping the side of the sofa. “If only to satisfy your curiosity, I’ll tell you this.” He leaned forward, his voice low. “The Third-Word works differently from the others. That’s all I’ll tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTk3ZGMyMThjYzQ5NWY5YmY2YWQ0NTJmZDQzMzAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… Thank you, Greatlord.” Serena bowed her head, knowing she shouldn’t push any more. Greatlord Oshiro likely had a reason for sharing even that with her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjRkMjEyODE5ZTRmOGVhMTI4M2UwMTU3NmZjMmIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did want to speak with you about her healing powers, especially her initial healing of the slums. I didn’t believe it until I saw it myself, but she even cleaned the area. Every spot of dirt, grime and dust was vanquished. That alone is almost as impressive as the healing. Can she separate the two? Can she heal without cleaning her target of all imperfections?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTY4Y2I2ZDY3MjQwZmNhNDM0MzEyNTVlOWQ4YWZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Greatlord.” Serena nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMThmYzFkZDhiMjRlZjI4NTgwNTI5MDY0YTM3ZjU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why did she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">clean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the slums as well?” Greatlords expression suddenly took on a strange emotion Serena couldn’t identify. Was it her imagination, or was there an element of… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sadness </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">in his eyes?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmMwZWNmODQxNjQwOWU5MGEwNDAwY2VhNzViYWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She wasn’t in full control,” Serena answered honestly. “She was… emotional at the sight of the orphanage's children being in such a state. I don’t believe she did it intentionally.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmJmMjRkMjFhYjQ5MDM4MjM1ODIyMTU3NDJmZDk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” Greatlord Oshiro rubbed his chin. “Her cleaning might have been more thorough than she intended. It wasn’t just dirt and grime from skin and stone but also grease and oil from metal and crystal. You must have her practice control. You can’t have her accidentally clean the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> engines of their coolant. Do you understand, Lord Halen?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjg2NzAwNmZmMzQwNGI5MDUxOTJlMmEzNDQ4MTMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">So, Amelia cleaned the machinery in the lowlands as well! Serena didn’t know Amelia’s magic could do that, but Greatlord Oshiro was right; it could be catastrophic for a ship! The lift engine would be fine, but the propulsion engine, with its many moving parts, would quickly overheat and possibly even explode if Amelia accidentally removed the lubricant keeping it-</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmMyM2Y5ZGRmZTRkOTJiMjZiN2M3MGZhYzlkZWY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena froze, and her mouth momentarily dropped open before she remembered to close it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjRjOTg5MzMwZjQyZTM4YmMyZTVmMWM2YTFiNmUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A question needed to be asked. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTM4YjJlYTdjMDRmM2ZiZTM5NzhmMDBjYjc2MTRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A question she didn’t really want the answer to, but she had to know.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTNmNzc1YzE2NDQzZTRhMjNiZDkwNDNkOTkxZTY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord…” she began tentatively. “The lowland fire. Was it truly… due to a baker's oven?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDRhMTAzZGE0MTRiNTRiZmE1ZDlmYmM0M2JkN2Nl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…” He tapped the couch’s armrest. Once… twice… thrice. “The report we produced stated the origin of the fire was a baker’s oven, so…” His expression darkened. “The origin was a baker’s oven. I suggest not questioning the official report any more, Lord Halen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmEwMjY2OWNlOTQxNWNhZjMyNTNhMGUyMmUzNzMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, Greatlord,” Serena said.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2ZmYjI2ZjY3YTRjMDFhODI2YWUwZjg1MTI3YjYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m merely doing </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">my </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">duty and raising a point of concern regarding her powers that may have an accidental detrimental effect on your ability to carry out </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">your </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">duties.” Greatlord Oshiro explained. “Make sure you take adequate measures to prevent any future complications, Lord Halen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmZlMDVkZjU5YzRhNmZhYjQ2Nzk2MWRkMTJlMmFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Greatlord.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmZjMDI3ZDMyODRiNTM5NzkwNDNiMDE3OWY5ODQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She must never know</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I must never tell her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjY2MmIwNzg3NjRmYTc5YTUzMjBjM2ZlYzFlMTE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord Oshiro took another sip of the earth-tea and Serena copied him. Still unpleasant. “How is life in the academy?” He asked, his expression softening as if the previous topic had never been discussed. “Have you found any promising talent? Surely that Melanie Mori girl meets your standard?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjI1NWYwNDRkZDRmYWI4Zjk2MjJkOWM5NWQwNDkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Greatlord, along with some others.” Serena swallowed. “I do have some concerns. Given the seriousness of my future duties, I can’t help but question the rationale behind forming a new group of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">softhorns</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Even if they are talented in their abilities, they lack the wisdom of age and experience of real combat. I find myself wondering if it wouldn’t be better to bring in some veterans instead?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzg1MDU3NDljOTRiNjNiZDM3YmE5NjQ1MjQ5ZWMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been a question troubling her for a while. The original justification provided by Chesterfield was that they wanted an elite team that could work with Amelia with no existing bias against humans. Only… Serena had seen demons like Highlord Driss and Flakken Holm, both from the North, be capable of putting their biases aside.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODM2Y2QzOTEwNDQxOGZhY2NkYjQ0YmQ0ZmZiY2Jl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good deduction,” Greatlord Oshiro intoned. “The lack of existing biases is more of a happy coincidence. Why, then, do you think it was so important for us to get her in an academy and help scout a team of demons more or less </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her age</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” He raised an eyebrow, signalling he wanted her to arrive at the answer herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjY5ZjVkZDdkODQ4YTU4NzkwNGYwODI4YWI0OGEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because…” Serena began, her mind racing to connect the dots. Why had they put Amelia in an environment around budding trainee officers and not integrated her into an experienced elite squad? Why did they want her to take an active part in forming a new team? </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmUzMjY3NTc4ZDRkY2E5OGFlYjFjN2JkNGQ0ZGIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Why had he emphasised the words ‘</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her age’</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTFiYTMzMzExNTQ0MzY5MDc2OGZlOWU5NDU1NTI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Friends…” she answered. “No, not just friends. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Connections</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” She felt her eyes widen at the realisation. “Connections,” she repeated. “You want to bind her to the Empire.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWEwMjJmMDQ0ODQzYTM5OWQ1ZjFhNjk1MzE4Yjll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right,” Greatlord Oshiro’s eyes glinted dangerously. “She’s a human in a world of demons. It’s natural for her not to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fit in</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The last thing we want is for her to leave our clutches. She must be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bound</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to the Empire. Not by chains of force, but with things more powerful. Just as a great ironwood tree burrows its roots into the earth, we want Amelia to do the same. We want her roots of friendship to run deep, her sense of loyalty and duty to her squadmates to trap her, and her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">relationships</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to make her never consider leaving. In that sense… you’ve done well, Lord Halen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzk3YTRiZGY4ZjRlZjhiMGRjMGZiNjk3ODQ1ZjY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, that was right. Greatlord Oshiro would have read all the intelligence reports detailing just how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">close</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena and Amelia were. However, it seemed that any moral concerns he might have over the matter were irrelevant when it came to the much more important goal of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">binding</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWI2ZGFhMWFmNDQzMzc4ZTNhYzQzMjA3YjMzYmZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not sure how to respond…” Serena mumbled. She didn’t like thinking of Amelia as a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bound</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Still, her mind, trained by years of rational and practical education, further developed by her battlefield experience, couldn’t deny the cold logic before her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTgxYmEwNTlhYzQzZDE5NTQxZjcwYjdmZjU2NzBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if, like the tea, it left a sour taste in her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWNiM2UzNmQ1MTRhNmE4NTE3MDJjMGExZjFiMmI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ruthless, isn’t it?” Greatlord Oshiro replied. “Don’t view it from the point of view of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena Halen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, but from the point of view of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Halen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, servant of our Overlord and the Divine One. It’s not like anyone wishes the girl any harm. Quite the opposite, we are all immensely invested in keeping her happy. In a matter of a few months, she’s become one of the Empire’s most important strategic assets, and our actions must reflect that. The Western Overlord has recommended Vikram to fully sanction her lordship.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzIwYTg4OGIyMTRkZDM5ZmY3NTY0M2FlYmNlZTFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWUyMGRkZmY4YTQyZDFiMDQ4ZmFkYTBiZmM0NTk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!?” Serena burst out before quickly correcting her tone of voice. “Sorry, Greatlord.” She readjusted her position on the couch, resisting the urge to stand up and pace. “If I may ask, why?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGE5MjZhNGY5NDQ1YjU4NDFjZDhmMWQwYWNhMjgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It came out in parliament a few weeks back. An official request.” The greatlord shrugged. “The justification is her actions during the fire. It’s not without precedent, but it's certainly unusual for the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">West</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to put their horns out like this. She also has an official invitation to visit the Western Terra Firma, so you’ll have no trouble getting a travel visa should your duties take you in that direction.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODNjNTI0OGI0ZDQ3MmZhYThmZWVlNzVlMzJkOTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…” Serena trailed off, absorbing the information. A part of her wanted to ask what the Greatlord knew about the ever-mysterious Western Overlord but figured she’d pushed her luck far enough. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmRlZjA0MjhhMjQyMjNiZjIxNTJlYzgyZDA0NjM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was one question left.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDg4MWNiOGQ1YTRjNzhiZWZkMTM5NWNiMDhjOGE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The necklace you gave her for the ceremony, what’s the meaning behind that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjYyOWNlNGYzOTQ3YTBhN2RlZjMwYTRmMTY4ZDQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that?” Greatlord Oshiro stood up, walking to the window where he stood with his back to her. “That’s for the visiting cardinal. They're going to canonise her as a saint, and if she can be seen as honouring the demon church, it’ll erase the last bit of resistance.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDFmNWJkNzkxYjRlOTNhOTk0Y2Q3OTNiMzRkM2Ux" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s hands started reaching for her horns but, by a mighty effort, she was able to stop from embarrassing herself. Instead, she stood up, and after forcing herself to take a few breaths, asked, “You’re not jesting? They truly mean to make her… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Saint Amelia?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTlhMzI0NTk4OTQ5ZmFhZDk3ODVkODQ0YmM3MzQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The lowlanders already call her by that name, so it won’t change much,” came the answer from the window. “Friends. Relationship. Homestead. Titles. Duty. Loyalty…” The greatlord coughed. “And now religion. Each one an attempt to integrate Amelia Thornheart into the institutions of our Empire.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTI2MjI5ZTkzMjQ5MzRiZGNiYTc3NzUzMTdlMTE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not sure she would agree to it,” Serena pointed out. “It’s not the kind of thing she would want. The extra responsibilities might be too much for her.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWFkMjdjMzRmYTRlYzY5OTcxMDlhMTAwYzUzZGFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There won’t be any extra responsibilities. She only needs to take the title officially. With that, she’ll become a famous symbol of the Empire, and that’s what’s important; that she’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">of the Empire</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Greatlord Oshiro turned to face Serena. “It’s a lot, but you’ll be leaving soon to a new Terra Firma. It’ll be a well-deserved change of pace for both you and our city.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDVjNGI3ZTU5MTRhZmU5MzE1YjdhMTEwYjY1NDY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I.. see. What about her lordship?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Mjc3YjhiNzYwZDQ1YzJhYmJhMWQ2ZDY0ZGIxYWEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have to wait at least a year, regardless of the opinion of another Overlord. There are plenty of Lord-Prospects in the East who have been waiting for five years or more. It’s too risky to inflame them, especially with how delicate the situation in the Far East is already.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmY4MDRmMTc2MjQ2ZWJiMzlkMjkzODNjYjMxMmM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see,” Serena said softly. In all honesty, her brain was overheating from so many repeated revelations. She should be delighted for Amelia, happy that she was going to move up so quickly in the ranks of the Empire. But she wasn’t. Not because of jealousy or envy but because she was worried too much too fast would put undue stress on her girlfriend.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGMyZGY3YTJlZDQxN2NhN2UwYzg2ZWUzMTUyOWQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There she was again, instinctively putting Amelia ahead of the Empire.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTBmYmU5NWMwNTRhNGJhMTFmZDdjNjIyMGJjN2Zh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Why didn’t it feel wrong?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDU0Njk4NDRiYzQzZDU4M2YzMWI1NTA4MDlkMzhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She felt like she needed a holiday. Somewhere far away, somewhere where she and Amelia could just…</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTk5NzIyMTg1MTQyM2Y4Zjk0OTYwOTVmM2IxZTlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjFjYTM0NjdjMTQxMmU5N2Q5ZGFjZTkyYjIyZDg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You mentioned a new Terra Firma,” Serena pointed out. “Do you know where our next destination is?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTFmOTMxMTAxMTRmOTlhZGEzMTZmNjhkZDIxNGI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, but it’s not for me to say,” came the reply. “Although… I’ll give you a hint…” The Greatlord’s voice took on an amused tone.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDYyYzc2OTBmMzQxNzU4NTZmYzY4NDZjYTZiOGRl" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Prepare for somewhere </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">warm</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Seventy-Four: Award Ceremony</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNlN2RlMTFmMWQxZTQ4ZjE5MTZhN2MxZjEwMTQ5MGY4"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNhMjE1MzVkNmRhNjQwNmI5M2RiYTA1NGNlNTA3OTYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few days later, the award ceremony was held at the Asamaywa Ceremonial Grounds. It was a place familiar to Serena. She had first attended it as a teenager when her brother Gin became an officer. Many years later, it was where her graduation had been held and, most recently, where she had watched her father become a highlord. The piece of land was large and rectangular, slotting itself forcefully amongst the hustle and bustle of the populous city. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDMwNzQxOTNlZTRhMmM4MDU1MWZkYjc1NzhiNGVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an open space with paved flooring and a raised platform at the far end. Two stone statues flanked the entrance: Sango, the legendary warrior of Sangoism, and his spiritual wife and Trusted, the Empress of Demonkind. They both wore traditional Samino armour and carried spears. While Sango's statue had a determined expression, the Empress’s was gentle. In her other hand she held an orb, representing her control over the Blue Moon itself.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWI5OWE5MmFkNzQxOTFhNDU4ZjczNzQ2Njk1YTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena always felt like she was being watched when walking through the entrance. The sheer presence that even a statue of the Empress emitted forced everyone to straighten their posture, even if they weren’t sure exactly why they were doing it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODE1Njg0YTg1MjQzMDQ4YzMyZGYxNzI1YzQwNzU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She and Amelia took their position in one of two waiting areas nestled in the open air to the left and right of the entrance. The one they were in was for significant members of society, Lord-Prospects and above. Highlord Yasuda was the highest-ranking individual present but not the only Speaker; Lunaria Inoue, Gregory Takeda and Ryosuke Yamamoto were some of the many academy Speakers who had answered the call. She also recognised the Earthlord, who had tirelessly protected the square with his earthen walls. After a short conversation, it turned out that he was a fully sanctioned lord, who governed a large territory of farmland in the lowlands.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDEwMGEzMzQ1ODRhYWJhNGI4MzA4MDM3MmY0MDdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing all these people here again reminded her that her experience in the square was just a tiny part of a much larger firefighting effort. Outside of where she had worked, thousands of others had been working together around the fire’s rim.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzA1MjZhNjYwZTQ2NWE5ZDRlNzhhMTgyZGQ2NTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side was another waiting area where a much larger group was gathering. It contained all the civilians whose bravery during the fire had earned them recognition. Among them were Melanie Mori, Hinako Aikawa, Daichi Ishitani, and nearly a hundred other warriors and mages from the Asamaywa Academy and other institutions. There were also a few dozen that had no talent with aether. They were the brave citizens of the lowlands who had heroically helped organise the firefighting efforts.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmRiNmU0OTgwZDRlZDZiZDFiNTliMjBmMjBkMmM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it was because of nerves, but many kept looking at the noble waiting area and gossiping amongst themselves. While the ones with some experience with aether were more taciturn - their education imposing proper etiquette into them - the others didn’t seem aware of how easily Serena and her peers heard their whispered conversations.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWY4OTI3YTIxODQwN2E4MTE0OGYzZjNiMjYzN2I1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s Highlord Yasuda, isn’t it? I saw him fly in and out of the fire, rescuing dozens!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDhjM2I0MmZmNjQxZjQ4YjJlZWIxNDQyYjZiNWE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve never seen a Highlord in person before! Ah! He’s so handsome!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWM1YTg0ODViMzQ0Y2Q4ZjExYTgxY2I5NDE2NGJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I’m not mistaken, isn’t that Serena Halen? The captain of the Black Ship?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWFkODJhNzIxNjRiNmY5N2I5Nzc5Y2UxOGI4MGRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think you’re right, and she’s standing next to the Golden Healer!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmQzNDE0OWMyNjRiOWNhMTMwNjFkODhiZTk0ODUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia stepped closer and whispered, “They’re talking about you!” She grinned before adding, “You’re so famous!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWFkMzBjOThmMDRkM2RhMmY0MjA0ZTQ1NDMxNjg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So are you,” Serena muttered her reply. If it wasn’t for Highlord Yasuda and the other nobles around, she would have added ‘Idiot’. Even so, she and her peers had to more or less stand there and pretend they couldn’t overhear the incessant whispering going on.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTMyODkzYzhkMTRlOGZhODNjYjQ1NDkxNDBmNzNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t always easy having enhanced perception.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGNiNjk3NWZiNjRlY2JhZDVhNzRlZWU3ZTQxNDE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She occupied her mind by adjusting her clothing. Everyone wore some variation of a traditional Samino kimono. The women wore light colours wrapped with a patterned sash while the men wore dark greys and blacks, with the addition of loose jackets, emphasising their forms. Serena’s kimono was decorated with silver thread that wove itself into shapes of war: swords, spears and other bladed weapons. Meanwhile, while Amelia had chosen a flowery design like most women, she’d refused to let Serena talk her out of buying the red sash with depictions of peekas playing embossed upon it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGM0YjYyMGRlYTQ1OTNhMWI2Y2MwZGNmM2Y0NjNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was it with this human and her obsession with peekas!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGZlODM0YTE1YzQwYWRiMWU5YzM4ZDk1ZTQ5Y2M2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At least Amelia looked good in red - it matched her crimson eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2Y0M2QzMDFjZDRhY2FiMDBiZjZkODVmMTNmM2Yw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Time passed and Serena talked with the other nobles, mainly discussing the fire and congratulating them on their diligent and dutiful work in slowing the fire’s spread. The topic of Lord Kanamori’s effective exile was avoided. Instead, people took the shameless opportunity to build connections with Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDJhMjQ3NWY3ZjRhZmNiNzNlYzIzNzFlZjRiMGU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord-Prospect, House Fuwara would love to extend a welcome…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTJjZjQyMjEzMTQ1NmY5OTg2YTYyODI5MzJiOTc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The moons must have blessed us that night for you to be there…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjc1YjJlOTc4MzQ3YWFiOWZlNjdkYjQ0NzkyODYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you seen the new play in the theatre? It’s highly reviewed. Perhaps you would…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmJmZjRkNjAzOTQ0NjBiMGU1NWMyMDQwNDVjMDk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s here,” Highlord Yasuda growled, prompting everyone to stop their unbearably polite harassment.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjliYTY3NjU3ZTQwYzVhZWFhZjQ3MzA3YjdkZGVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord Oshiro strode through the entrance and, as if he cast a spell on the entire ceremonial grounds, silence descended once his presence made itself known. He approached the noble waiting area first, flanked by his guards. His face seemed devoid of the tension Serena had seen the last time they spoke. Instead, he seemed light and cheerful.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTZjYmIyNmU1ZTRkMzhhMTg2M2Q0ODdjM2YyMmFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome,” he intoned, stopping in front of the group, who all bowed in unison.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTVhNzk3NjI0ZjQzNGVhNjQ3ODM4Y2IwNjU4YzM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is I who should be bowing to you, Lords of the East,” he said with a smile. “You have done a great service to our city. While these little metallic horns I’ll be pinning to your chest seem small in comparison to your large deeds, I assure you I will never forget your actions that day.” He bowed respectfully. “As is tradition, we’ll be handing out bronze first, then silver and then gold. Most of your group will go last and leave last. It’s a lot of waiting, but I’ll be up there even longer!” He smiled. “If I knew how much standing around there would be, I would have never accepted my ascension to Greatlord!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDY2OWJkNzVlNzQ5YjJiZjEwYWQ1MWM4NGVlMGQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">His jest earned him some polite laughter. “Now, excuse me,” he continued, tilting his head in the direction of the other waiting area. “I now need to make our other guests very uncomfortable.” To some more laughter, Greatlord Oshiro left and approached the other group. At the sight of the approaching Greatlord, most people grew white, and some even began trembling.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTAwNDg1MjcyYTQyYzhiMjVlYzZhMTA0NDI5MWFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Such was the presence of a Greatlord to an ordinary citizen. Unless you were a Lord or Highlord who regularly interacted with one of them, the sheer </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">gravitas </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">power</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> they exuded with every motion and word put even battle-hardened warriors on edge.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzIxNTc1OGY0OTQ5OWI5ODczZDYwN2MzODZjNmIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While Greatlord Oshiro did his best to calm the others' nerves, the seating around the edges began to fill up as the family members poured in. The ceremonial grounds had two rows of seating at the sides and a special seating area at the far end, overlooking the raised stage. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGI1YmZjMjQyNjRhNTA4Y2NkOGNmODJhYWQ1NWNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t take long for Serena to see her father, mother, and Lani settle into seats at the far end, positioned at the front row with the families of the other Highlords of Asamaywa.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjYwN2IwMzMyMzRmYjFiZDc3ODE5MGMxMzVkOWE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Grandmother wasn’t there. Hopefully, no illness had befallen the old demon.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTA1YjJlYTE2MjRmNWU5NTQ5OTI4MGU3MGFlNTZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lani waved enthusiastically before her mother grabbed her hand and forced it to her side.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDZhNjBmNzdhYTQwNzY5NzBiYWY3NjQ1ODhlOTBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, Amelia waved back, which delighted Lani and set off a hushed but heated argument between her and her mother.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTFjNjg2ZTNlODQ2YzBhZDEwNDhkMTE2ZmYzMjNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her highlord father seemed to be trying to pretend he was somewhere else.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDcyN2Q0MWI1ZTQxZDU5NmQxOTIxNDlkOWU5MDkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shame Nina isn’t in the area</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena mused. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s been a while. I wonder how she’d react to Amelia?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM5YmIxZjMwOTQ0ZjQ1MDc5NGQwOTM4Y2QyYTg4YWI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Making a mental note to send her smartest sister a letter in the near future, Serena waited while Greatlord Oshiro took his place at the podium and for the seats to fill. A few assistants coordinated things on the stage, making last-minute adjustments and then leaving to position themselves near both waiting areas.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjhkYTNmZjNlMjRkMzZiMWRiY2M4ODNhNzVhZTJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a long silence developed. It was as if an unspoken cue informed everyone to stop talking. The anticipation built until the bell towers across the city suddenly rang their hourly chime. Greatlord Oshiro must have been waiting for them, as he immediately began his speech once they finished.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjQ1ZDE1YWQ0ODQxODM5MTFiNjRjNTdiZjRjMDU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome,” he boomed. “Lords of the East! Citizens of the Empire! Welcome! I stand before you today as not only the Lord of the City, but a Lord in mourning! I grieve, no less and no more than you do, at the tragedy that befell our great city!” Greatlord Oshiro continued to give an overview of the inferno, the official report of its origins, and how the city fought so tirelessly to contain it. He didn’t mention the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> embodiment directly, only referencing that due to the threat to Asamaywa Station, a decision had been made to reveal one of the Empire’s strategic assets.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjA2N2E3OWY5ODRjMWZhZjE4M2QxYTNmNGUyYWNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he held a minute of silence for the victims of the fire.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzgwZDY3YjU2MjRjZmRiNGExNDZiNDM0NjFmNTIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the sombre period of reflection ended, Greatlord Oshiro spoke, saying, “Attendants, if you please.” The attendants near the waiting group on the other side began flicking through their papers, directing a group of four civilians to make their way down the ceremonial grounds. Serena could hear the attendant walking with them, giving them instructions on ceremonial etiquette: when to bow and where to stand.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmMzNTliNTNkMTRkNGJiZjU2MzNlZWNiYTNkZjBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Doing four at once,” someone nearby said approvingly. “It’ll go quick then.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWVmNjBkNjEyNjQwNTBiNTA4ZjcxMTQxOWVkOWQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The others murmured their agreement.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWU4MzM1NDEzNjQ4NzZhZmE0ZTExYTQ5MjY2Mjdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The four made their way to the stage and, one by one, they were rewarded with their Bronze Horns. Greatlord Oshiro would introduce each one by name, their position in society, and what actions they undertook to earn them the reward. The actions were varied, but all were impressive in their own right.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTMxYjcxNjA4YjRjYTJhODIyYjE0YWM0ZGFlYjVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For volunteering to open warehouses for those that had lost everything.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGRlNWMyMWNjOTQ1OWVhZGQwMzIxNDA1MDJkZGZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For risking his life by knocking on hundreds of doors in the opening hour as the fire licked his heels.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTI2Mzc0YTZkMjQ2MTNhMTM3YmU3YzVkYzNkZGE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For organising a waterline and delaying the fire until the earth mages could begin their work.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTJmZmE3OWE0YzQ1Njc4NDVjMGZiOWQyMDM5YTNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The first group had their Bronze Horns pinned to their chests and were scuttled off to the side to begin the lengthy waiting process. Group after group went up, pulling students, civilians, and other individuals who had contributed selflessly to the firefighting efforts. Hinako Aikawa was in one of the last groups, earning herself a Bronze Horn for her magical aid. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTRlNzU3ZDNhNTQ3YjFhZjNhYTdhYzAyNmM0OTRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The student named Daichi Ishitani also earned himself a Bronze Horn for volunteering his skills in construction work over the last month. Serena briefly wondered if anyone else knew the prideful demon had only done so because Amelia wouldn’t welcome him into her private training sessions otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmUxZGExZDhjMjRiNzJhN2U2Y2MwYzAyNmM5NzBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, after nearly two hours had passed, the last of the Bronze Horns was awarded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmIwODZjMTI4YzQ0ZDFhMGZmZjhhYWI4N2I1NDRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A short break was announced before the Silver Horns would be given out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzMwNDQyNDg1MDQwYjE5MDBmMzk0MGExNzhiMzhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena glanced at her family. Her father was sitting proudly, every bit the diligent highlord he was. Her mother looked on with an annoyed expression and it didn’t take Serena long to see why. Lani slouched in her chair and seemingly refused to sit back up. Serena wasn’t entirely certain, but she swore Lani was repeatedly muttering the word ‘bored’. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDFkZmI4OWJmMDRmMTY5ZjYwMGFkY2I0NjYyYTQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena chuckled to herself. Her stubborn, annoying sister grated her nerves almost every time they met, but she still loved Lani dearly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmI5NjY3YzcwMjQxNzM4NDc3Y2JiYmI3ZTJmMjJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Reminds me of someone else…</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she thought idly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmM5YjBhYTIxNzQzYzQ5M2FmOTMxZTVjYWI4Njdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After some time, Greatlord Oshiro resumed the ceremony. His voice remained strong and as reliable as a lift engine, booming across the open space. He read out the contributions and achievements of the Silver Horn recipients. Emalina Honda earned hers for organising the hundred-person medical operation that kept so many from dying before Amelia’s magic could heal them. Gregory Takeda, the head of the Department of Engineering, earned his Silver Horn for efficiently and quickly guiding the hundreds of people involved in the construction of the earthen walls, and effectively redirecting a nearby stream to flood part of the lowlands, slowing the fire down greatly. Ryosuke earned his for overseeing the warriors at the fire's edge, taking enormous strain from Highlord Yasuda.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWRmN2Q5NzMzMTQzMjA5NTFhYmNhODQxZGVlMGJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mel also earned herself a Silver Horn. With Amelia’s wards, she had been able to throw herself into the flames again and again, working with Serena to bring back the injured and trapped citizens. The poor girl looked like she was going to pass out on stage, but she kept it together.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjI2NjA2OTlmYTQyZGY5ZmRiNTQ2MzExNjI2ODE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She’ll make a fine officer,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena thought, looking at the Silver Horn pinned to Mel’s chest. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDVkM2I0OGUxNjRlODZhNzg1YTBkNTc3OThhNWMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I made the right choice in picking her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDc0NmQwMGQ0ZjQzODViMmJjZjNiZjk4ZWY4YWMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, finally, after almost another hour, it was time for the recipients of the Golden Horns. By now, the amount of people left was few. Serena, Amelia and Lunaria were the only ones from the academy. There was also the Earthlord and the handful of warriors that had run into the inferno repeatedly with Serena, surviving only thanks to Amelia’s wards and healing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDI1OTY2MTI4ZTQ0YTliNTE3NmQzYWM0YzY1MDZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They went up one by one instead of groups of four. The warriors went first, pride and gratitude plastered upon their faces. For the Golden Horn recipients, Greatlord Oshiro took even longer to introduce each one, emphasising their previous achievements in depth before their contributions relating to the fire. When he pinned the Golden Horn on their chest, the audience erupted into rapturous applause.</span></p><span class="cjU1OTdjZGIzZjNhMjQyOTM5ZmIwNTQ5MTZkOTAwYzcy"><br/>This story has been unlawfully obtained without the author's consent.

<p class="cnM5NGRmYzA2MDBkMTQ1OGNiMjU1MGFhMTQ5MmMyNzIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Earthlord went up next, followed by Lunaria. They both earned their horns for essentially doing the work of a hundred normal mages. Lunaria was especially complimented by the Greatlord, who stated that the station would have almost certainly been engulfed in flame if Lunaria hadn’t used her massive aether capabilities to shift the rocky foundations.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjhlYTFlNzc5MzRjYzlhMzZiNTM4NzI0YmNiYzkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then it was Highlord Yasuda's turn, and in almost no time at all, only two were left.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODE5ZDRjZjkzYTRmZTliODIzM2YwZTM0YTNkNTQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena and Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTFkMzM3MDQ0NjQ5YzVhODdjYWIxMjZmMWY4NWI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord Halen,” an attendant spoke. “If you could follow me, please.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjc0MDM0YzYyYTRmN2U5ZWU5NGE5ZTIwYTU4OGZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you in a bit,” Serena muttered to Amelia. Her girlfriend didn’t respond; she seemed preoccupied with chanting mantras that sounded oddly like the phrases ‘no one is watching’ and ‘no need to be nervous’.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjA4NDA5ZTUxMjQ4YTU5NjZiMWQyOTdkNzFjNmQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d be fine, wouldn’t she?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzA4YTljZTk4MjQzMDlhZThiNzFkZGVhODViMjdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena walked the length of the ceremonial grounds with the attendant. She could feel all eyes on her, but that was fine. As captain of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and instructor of the Asamaywa Academy, Serena was more than used to being the centre of attention. She strode up the platform steps and stood before her Lord Superior.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjNmOWFiZWQzYzQ1YTFiOTk4N2YyYTc3NTZiNjQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord Oshiro began describing who she was and listing her achievements, focusing on her valuable contributions to the war, both on and off the battlefield. When it came to the fire, he emphasised that Serena, under her invocation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">had braved the hottest of flames and rescued the most people individually out of all other warriors. Photographers took the opportunity to take as many photographs as possible, prompting a few dozen hisses of steam to sound when Greatlord Oshiro pinned the Golden Horn on her chest.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWQ5MzUzN2ZmMTRkYWE4Y2IxNWY2YTQ1MmE4YzA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I imagine this won’t be the last time I’m pinning an award on you,” Greatlord Oshiro muttered. “Let’s hope next time is under better circumstances, don’t you think so, Lord Halen?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWQyMjJiOTY1NDQ4MzM4MjI3OWMxZTEwMDBhYzhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Greatlord,” Serena replied, bowing deeply when he took a step back. “It’s an honour to serve you, our Overlord, and the Empress above.” With the formalities over, Serena took her position next to the other recipients. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzljOTg3Y2NjZjRmMTliNzY3MmIyMjFkNDIzMzUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord Oshiro wasted no time, already beginning his speech as Amelia approached the platform. Looking at her, she looked every bit like an elegant lady, confidently striding towards her deserved accolades.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDhmMDA2ZDBjMTRjOTY5MzRiY2IxY2NmMGI5OWM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But Serena knew her girlfriend’s stomach was twisting inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmQxM2YxMTFjNTQ1M2Q4ZDQyMWM2MGQ4MzZjNmZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing would go wrong, right?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDc2ODZlMjlhOTQzNmU4ZDExZDZmMmUzYjMzYmY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is with great honour to award the next recipient,” he began. “Those of us who haven’t been reading the headlines in the last few months would have still heard her spoken of by other names. The ‘Golden Healer’, ‘Lady Thornheart of the Lowlands’, and even…” Greatlord Oshiro paused momentarily. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Saint Amelia</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. In such a short time, she’s left her mark of love and kindness upon the world of demons. As our war ends, this noble woman symbolises unity between our two races. She emphasises our desire for prosperity and peace! I, of course, refer to Lord-Prospect </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!” He finished his opening introduction by dramatically gesturing to the side of the stage where Amelia was walking up the steps with an uneasy smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmQyNDk5MDA0MDQ4Y2M5OTZhZTAyMjVhYTE5YzE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And, just as everyone began clapping, Amelia tripped on the last step.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTI2N2QyOGI5NDQ0ZTI4YTdlMGIxMDFhYzNmYjNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She took one stumbling step, then two, then seemed like she was going to stabilise before collapsing face-first into the wooden ground with a distinctive </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thud</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that echoed around the ceremonial grounds far more than it had any right to.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzFiNTcxNTJmMTQ4ZjQ4YTI3OWVjNmU1MWRmYzkw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena had never seen an audience start and stop clapping so quickly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTdjM2I2ZTQxZTQzOGU4ZDA5YTU4ZDg2NjRhZDYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few whimpers of sympathy were muttered from those around her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzNmODJjMjAyMTQ0MTI5YzVhOWE5MTcxNTEwZTUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh dear…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzg5OTVhNjc5ODQ2MzZhMGM3NDhkNWM4MDQ4NTJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWE2MWM0MWZmZTRjMTA4Y2E1OTI2ODQ2NDJjMjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oof…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2RjNjNhYzQyNDRiODY5NjRjYWJiMDhlNmVkMzZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn it,” Amelia muttered, accepting the hand of a nearby attendant. She clambered to her feet, fixing her sash and uniform that had become untidy, all while looking at the floor and mumbling, “Just a dream, just a dream…” She finished fixing her clothing, put her characteristic grin on her face and strode forward with determined steps like it never happened.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzdjYTJiMmU0NDQ1YmJiNzQxN2EyNjE2M2EyNGMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an almost flawless continuation if it weren’t for her face, burning as red as the Red Moon itself! Serena reckoned that if she pushed her aura into orange and focused a little, she would be able to hear Amelia’s pounding heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTk5NTgyMWY5ZjRhNWNhZDU1ZmI4YTJjZGMxMzY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Poor Amelia. Serena made a mental note to hug her on the carriage ride back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTQ4NTdkODVmMzQxODA5NjdmMGUzNTdkZmMyZWQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahem!” Greatlord Oshiro began. Before continuing with Amelia, he took a moment to tell a story of when he embarrassed himself as a young lord. To ordinary citizens watching, it must have come across as a tactful attempt to reset the mood and ease Amelia’s awkwardness. Those who understood that a Greatlord’s actions were often far more calculated didn’t miss the secondary implication under the story.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWZmZmFkMmQ5YzQ0YzI5MjgzZDU1YTJiMmUxYjI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m willing to embarrass myself to protect Amelia Thornheart.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlMDUxZWExZGE4NDRlMDJiNjRlZmQzZTk2NDc3NmE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia’s benevolent actions saved the lives of hundreds of demons, perhaps even thousands,” Greatlord Oshiro announced to the seated attendees. “Her expertly casted wards protected many of her fellow Golden Horn recipients as they delved again and again into the white hot fires. Her healing of those pulled from the inferno gave them a second chance at life. Despite knowing it would exhaust her, Amelia's grand spellwork even covered those working at the fire's edge, saving even more lives!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2QxYmQ0OTY3NTQwNDlhMzU1OWI3YzVlMjJkNzJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena didn’t miss the not-so-subtle implication that Amelia’s spells </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">exhausted</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her. She’d spoken about this messaging before with Amelia. It was all to construct a narrative where Amelia and her Lord Superior would have a handy excuse to politely push back on requests for her healing, allowing some breathing room in the future.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzNjYzE5ZDlkNTRlZGZiNDMzNTU1NjY1YThlMTA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The photographers went wild when Greatlord Oshiro approached her with the Golden Horn. Over steam hissing, Serena heard Greatlord Oshiro quietly say, “You’re not the first to trip on those steps, believe me.” Then, he leaned forward slightly and whispered, “Don’t worry; you’ll have a chance to redeem yourself at the ceremonial dinner. You’ll be carving.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2MxYjYwOTdhMjRmNjM5MzkxZWU2Y2I1YWFhYTRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He bent back with a grin as Amelia’s eyes widened and her mouth opened. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWE2ZDY1Zjk3MjQ4MDRiZWQ1MzQ1NzBkOTI0MDUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only jesting,” he said before turning around and announcing the next part of the schedule to everyone.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDI3NjRlZGQ1MTQxMjY5ODc0NmIyNmM5OTE1NGM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Poor Amelia! Serena made another mental note to give her an extra long massage to make up for today. She would massage these awkward memories out of her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzkxNjYwZWIzZjQ1NGM5NjgyOGU1OTJhYTg1ZDhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven hells</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m such a good girlfriend, aren’t I</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmViODkxNGFiYjRiNzg5NmFkNDZlMjg1MjlkYzU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the pinning ceremony complete, they were let go individually to line up in front of the stage. It took half an hour but was still much quicker as it was more of a final roll call than anything else. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDQ4N2Y0ZjgwYzRkYWNiNjBjNjYyYWJmMjk5NWNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once positioned, Greatlord Oshiro loudly declared, “Lords of the East!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDgzZGMyY2RiZjQzOGU5OWY0ZjZkNjczMGQ1YTQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">All the attending Lord-Prospects, Lords, and Highlords sitting in the special seating area stood up. Serena glanced up to see her father standing tall, his face filled with pride.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2U1YzczN2YzNDQxMzY4ZjhhMTY0Mjk5YTk0Y2Uw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In honour of those that serve with excellence, we bow!” Greatlord Oshiro shouted before bowing to the medal recipients deeply. Then, all the lords in the special seating followed suit and bowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzc1Y2Y5OGMzMDQxMTU5ZDQ4ZTliM2IyMDdiMjA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena heard more than a few civilians swallow. To them, having a regular </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, let alone a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> bow to them out of respect was almost too much to handle.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWViMTdmOThiYTQ0MjY5MTE2ZDI0MTY1YmU1NDJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the act of gratitude finished, the main part of the ceremony was over. Families were allowed to come down from the stands to mingle with their sons and daughters. At the same time, dozens of attendants suddenly appeared and began setting up chairs and tables for the upcoming celebration dinner. They would be eating out in the open.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzg2YWJkMTc5ZjRkZDViODNlN2VlMzZlZmU4OGYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you hear what he said to me!?” Amelia hastily whispered. “I felt like I was going to cry… hey!” Her girlfriend puffed her cheeks out. “Why do you look like you’re trying not to laugh!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTdlZTFiMTE4NTQxMDZhMTU3NzJmZTFlMmIxMGYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not!” Serena protested while biting the inside of her cheek. “You did great,” she continued. “No one will remember what happened anyway,” she added reassuringly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDFmYWY0YTY0MTRlYjA5YzA1ZWE5MDViMzhmOWVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Daughter!” a familiar voice called.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTgwODg4M2E4ZDQwNTVhYTU0ZDIwYWU3ZDY5NDNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena turned to see her father making his way through the crowd with her mother and Lani behind them. Serena barely opened her mouth before she was captured by her father's arms.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2ZlMDVjNDBjNTQ3YjBhMWI2YjBmOTY2ZjFiZDQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A recommendation to commodore and now a Golden Horn!” her father intoned, squeezing her tight. “You and Nina just keep raising the status of this family! I’m proud of you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzAwOTk0NjlkZTQ0NTk4MjFlZDFlZTQxZDNiNWVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena smiled but awkwardly detached herself from her father’s grasp. “Thank you, Father. Mother! It’s great to see you! And Lani… are you behaving?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzU2YmFjOWMyZDRmNmZiY2JlMzcyYTAzYjJiMWVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” her mother said.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDY0ZGVhOWM1ZjQ2YjJhZTZkN2U3YmUyZTM2OTUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!” Lani chirped, hugging Serena. “Big Sister! My horns are getting bigger, aren’t they!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTJjOTc4OTkzMzQ3OGNhMjNkNTNkYjk5ZmRmMGFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lani!” Mother snapped.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTM4YzBlMmEwMzQ0ZmNiMWZiZGE1YzkyZjEwYjYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine.” Serena couldn’t stop herself from smiling. She rubbed her sister’s back before stepping back. “Hmm… I think they’re much bigger. What do you think, Amelia?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjdhN2UwOTU2ZjRlMTM4ZmRlMWQwMmNhYTY1YTFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah!” Amelia gave Lani a happy thumbs up. “You’ll overtake Serena in no time!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmNkMzZmNzk4OTRiNjQ5MDkwMDE3NjJhNTc4ZjVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe!” Lani giggled before suddenly pointing at Amelia. “Amelia! You have to come to my academy!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmYyNmNiMjFhZjQ3OWJhNGFlMDQxZmM2MmVmZTI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what?” Amelia blustered. “Why!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjEzNjcwYTMyYzQ5ZTA4Yzc3ODQwNjRmMGI2NzQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because no one there believes I’m friends with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">the</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia Thornheart! They keep calling me a liar!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjMzNDgyN2Y0NzRiNzNhZDRiZmI5NmNlZjZkZjE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my!” Amelia opened her mouth in mock indignation. “We can’t have that! Only… are you keeping up with your studies?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjA5MjE1MmE1MzRjOTNiMjZkOWU3MWRmNWNmZDRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, it was Lani’s turn to be flustered. “W-why does that matter?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2MwOGJhNGNjMTQ3MDJhNzJmNGU5NzIzY2I1MjY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You promised me you’d put your best effort in every workbook they gave you, didn’t you?” Amelia pressed forward, leaning in slightly. “You can’t ask me a favour if you don’t fulfil your promise to me, isn’t that right? Hmm?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzU5YmM5NWU0ZTQyMmRhZTg5MzJjZTg0ZmEyNzJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Yes,” Lani muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzQ2ZGU0N2FlNjRiZmU5ZmIyOWJkNjAwYmE5YTYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you keeping up with them?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTAwMGQzZjUyMDQwM2FiNDliMDVkOTVhMGZiMGEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Maybe,” Lani answered in a small voice, chewing her lip.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDAwOTBkODQxYzRjYWM4OTBhY2Q0ZDFhODA3MWQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She most certainly is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” her mother interrupted with a motherly glare. “She was good for maybe… How long was it, Lani? Five days? Hmm?” She crossed her arms as Lani shrunk under the disapproving gaze.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2YyZDEyNDQ3NDQ4MDA5ZjBmZGUyYmQ5ZDEwZTY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… oh!” Lani’s eyes suddenly widened. “I see someone from my academy over there! It was an honour seeing you again, Amelia! See you later!” Before anyone could stop her, she quickly bowed and bounced away to a group of teenagers who had gathered in their own space, away from the intimidating adults and nobles.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2Y2OTM2MzFmMjQ2NGJhYmIyNGUwZGYyNjJkYjdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s still the same,” Serena said, giving her parents a sympathetic stare. “How’s Nina doing? Have you had any communication?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzUwN2EzYWFmMjRiZDM5MjI0ZGIzN2Y4YTZkNzg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only to inform her of your award,” her father answered. “She gave her congratulations and wanted to attend herself, but she couldn’t get the time off. She’s been put in charge of some important project that she can’t talk much about. I think she’s travelling a lot. The last aethergram from her was routed from Killion!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTZhM2ZhN2Q4ZTRmOWRiZThlMjVlYmRiZTJlYWVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Killion? What would Nina be doing in the Southern Terra Firma?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzBjYTdiOTk1MzRjNTM5NGZkYTQ5ZjU3MTI4YWM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about grandmother? Didn’t she want to come?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2Q2OGE5ZjJjYjQ4MDJhYTMwMDhhZDMzZDhkNTUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We wanted her to, but she said-” Her father sighed. “-That if she had to leave the house every time you earned a medal, she’d be travelling until she keeled over.” He frowned momentarily. “I think that was her way of saying she’s proud of you…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2E5YmU3MmE3MjRiMGNhNDFmNjY3YzhiY2NiMjI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That sounded just like her. Still, Serena would like to see her grandmother again before leaving. The old devil was getting on, and Serena wouldn’t have many more opportunities to spend time with her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGVhNjIyNTc2ZDQ4OTM5Yzg0NjMxMzZkNjFkNGE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you staying for long?” she asked her father. “We’re set to sail shortly after graduation, but I’d like a family meal if you can fit it in. I’m busy myself, so no promises.” As their leaving date drew closer, Serena’s workload increased by the day. Her gunnery officers under Thorne were finishing up their training at the Asamaywa Gunnery School, and the installation of the new Ambler Firing Tables was being finalised and tested. Not only that, but she still needed to work with Amelia to settle on the final names for their softhorn elite squad.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzQ3Nzc2N2QyOTRlNGZiOGM5MjhmN2FkMTFhMmRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll find time,” her father nodded reassuringly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmM0Yzg2MmNjZjQwYmI5Yzc3NzM0MmIzNTIzMTUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia, you’re welcome to come,” her mother added sweetly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTIyODExNTZmNTQ0OWFhYjM2YTk5MDlhNzFkZTA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh! Thank you!” Amelia’s bright expression brightened further. “It’ll be an honour, only…” she leaned in slightly. “Please don’t make me carve.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2EwN2U2ZGE1ODQ5YmJiODYyOWViMjVjZmZlMDZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her mother raised a hand to her mouth, laughing politely. “Follow me, dear. Let’s take a walk around the grounds while you tell me about that lovely kimono of yours. Did Serena help you pick it out? There’s a lovely shop near…” Her mother expertly led Amelia away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDVmMDNiZjFiZDQyYTI5MjM5MWU2NjhiZjU5Mjll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena wasn’t concerned. After Amelia healed the slums, her mother changed her tune, and there was no sign of her prior subtle dislike. With Amelia becoming the talk of the Empire, even her mother couldn’t deny the advantages it would bring to align her to her house. Serena watched them momentarily before turning to her father and whispering, “Does she… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">know</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjdmZTNjYTg3ZTRiZWVhNjAwZDI3YjQ3YzRhY2Q4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“About? Oh…” Her father had a complex expression on his face. He looked around to make sure no one was nearby before whispering. “I think so, but you know what she’s like. She might never bring it up unless something…” He tensed his jaw, a look of worry forming on his face. “Unless something </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">obvious</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> happens.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGM5NzdhZDZkYzQyMjliMDAxY2JjMGM3ZjYyZmY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see,” Serena replied. “As long as Lani doesn’t find out…” she trailed off, happy to see her father nodding in agreement. Lani had stumbled upon her and Amelia practically undressing each other in Shimashina, and only by Amelia’s quick thinking had she been able to fool the innocent teenager. Should Lani find out for real… well, Serena didn’t know exactly what her little sister would do.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODA3NWI3YzhiZjQ5YmZiMWVhNjRhMGMzMmZiYmIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it probably wouldn’t be good.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDEyYzAxYzQ0YTQyZjVhNGY1ZDQ3M2UxNGZiODY1" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the cry of the city's bells the afternoon became evening and the dinner began. It was a neat affair with the nobles and their families maintaining polite conversation while the citizens from the lowlands tried not to draw too much attention to themselves but still whispered excitedly over the expertly cooked dishes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmJmYmMzMTI0ZDQxNGE4NWFkYWRjODA4MzhkOTcw" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYWE3ZDYyZmUwNjQxOTVhMDhmOWNlNzc0ZGUxMGMy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Down the table, Serena noticed one young man sitting next to Mel, looking like he’d rather be anywhere else. It was Mel’s brother, and he spent most of the meal picking at his food. He cast more than a few glances towards Amelia, but once he met Serena’s eyes he never looked their way again. Judging by how Mel’s parents were doting on their daughter and her Silver Horn, it seemed they had a new favourite child to fawn over.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGIyYjViZmMwMTRjODJhNjU0ZWExOGY5ZWYyOTFh" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NDBkMjI2MGI0ZjQ3MDdhOTVmYjdlYzRhNDBjYTJl" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was his fault for attacking Amelia so cowardly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTI4ZDI4ZjFmYjRkN2JiNWZiMDMyNjIwYTM0MDE5" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZjE3NGZiODNjODQ4Y2ViYmYyZmZlZWU0MmY4MWY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With food eaten, people mingled. Many nobles tried to establish ties with Amelia, but only a few were brave enough to attempt it while she was standing next to Serena’s highlord father. Amelia handled it well enough, giving polite non-answers. If the person pushed too far, Serena would just give them a glare and they’d back away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGE1OGJlZTUwYzRiNjNhMGIxY2I1ZTU5ZjBkMjgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly, as the sun began to dip low, people and their families excused themselves and returned to their homes. Just as Serena thought it might be time to go, Greatlord Oshiro appeared.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGNkZmNkMzEzZDQxOTJhNjhiOTRjZmEzNWY1OWMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lady Halen,” he intoned politely to Serena’s mother. “Highlord,” he greeted her father.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTI2OTE1ZDNhNzRlZGQ4NjZiMjEyNTkzNWE4NTc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlord,” they replied in unison.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjM4ODE0MmI0ZjQ3MWViMTgwYTc1MjZhYTdjY2Zm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m afraid I must take Lord-Prospect Thornheart with me. There’s one or two people who have been waiting a long time to meet her. One of whom is a grumpy old member of the clergy who’s been the source of a headache for me. Ah…” Seeing Amelia’s expression, Greatlord Oshiro glanced between her and Serena. “Would you prefer it if Lord Halen accompanied you? I know she’s been a supportive pair of horns in helping you navigate high society.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDI2Mjc4MzgwNTRiMmViOTAwNzQ5Y2Q2OGQwOWRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm! Yes, please!” Amelia nodded, the worry that started to form on her face quickly melting away.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTQ0NDdkZGEwMjQyMGU5ZDhkZjdkYWYzOGQyNGFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Both of you it is, then,” the greatlord said with a nod. “Lady, Highlord, thank you for your brief company.” He nodded towards Serena’s parents before turning and striding across the ceremonial grounds.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGU1YjE0MGJhNjQ4NjhhMWFhZTEyZWFmYmNmNzFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t wait for us,” Serena said hastily. “I’ll send you an aethergram afterwards!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmM5YjYwMDhjNTRhMTc5ZTJlMjNlNjcyZWI2NjEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright,” her father replied. “Good luck!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2Q1NDMxMTNiODRhMTM5ZjY0YzdmNjBkMjI5ZjM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Serena and Amelia were led through a door and down a corridor, stopping outside a sliding door. She had no illusions about who was on the other side of the door. Greatlord Oshiro had discussed the man in their prior meeting, and Serena had extensively talked about the matter with Amelia since.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjMxMjdlY2M1ODQzYzA4NWIyNjg2NmVmMTFlYzFh" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time for Amelia to meet the cardinal.</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Seventy-Five: An Unexpected Meeting</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM2M2UwN2I2N2MyMzQyMDFhMTI0NzIwNWJmY2Q1MjZl"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMyZDhhMDIyYjRmNzQ0MTc5ZGMxODI4M2JhYzM0ODM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When they stepped into the room, the cardinal greeted the trio almost immediately. Like herself, he was ethnically samino. His horns, in contrast to her own, were painted white with each horn bearing golden accessories; three hornbands and a horncap. His church robes mirrored the colour scheme; consisting of thick white cloth embroidered with golden thread. In his hands he carried a copy of the Demon Bible and an upside-down cross hung from around his neck.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2JjOGVkOGZiYzQzNDg4N2NjNTEzN2EyMWFhMjAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was old, perhaps older than Serena’s grandmother. His face was weathered, carrying the etchings of long decades of religious servitude. To a normal citizen the cardinal might come across as a kind elderly man, but Serena’s instincts told her a different story.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDRiMjNjNmM3ZDQ4MGZiNzY1M2ZjMzE3ZDY0Yjg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This cardinal was a Speaker.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWI2MzgyNzE1YzQzMjc4MmNmNGZkODEyNWI3MGI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” the old man murmured, making his way over to Amelia. “Your hair really does seem to shine, doesn’t it?” He smiled, catching Serena’s eyes. “I think I see why they call this one the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Golden Healer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, yes? Hmm…” He peered at Amelia closely, who stood there with an awkward smile. “Such a noble eye colour. Not normal for a human, is it? Was it a parting gift from </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> How strange… I thought the reports might be mistaken, as he’s known for giving golden eyes. No wonder Christdom’s so upset.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGM0MzRmY2U4NjQ1NjJiOWM5MzdlMmMyMzBhYTVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lord-Prospect Thornheart,” Greatlord Oshiro politely intoned. “Lord Halen, this is Cardinal Hiroshi, the church’s representative in the East. He also oversees the Archdiocese Major, consisting of Asamaywa, Asamino, and Asamoto, as its archbishop. Cardinal Hiroshi, may I introduce you to Lord-Prospect Thornheart and Lord Halen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODkyM2YxMTc1ZDRiYWI4NWVmYzY3NmQ1MGU3OWNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena bowed politely and Amelia quickly followed. The cardinal made the sign of the cross, his face breaking into a weathered smile. “How lucky we are, to have one of Tamerlane’s lost sheep find its way into our humble flock. May we sit? Greatlord Oshiro has kept me waiting all this time through that long ceremony.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmExMDU3MDNmMzRhNjM5YTkzYTBhMGU0ZmE1MzA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena didn’t miss how he intentionally used the name of the human pope.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODNmODZjZDczMzRmOGVhM2E1NjczNDM2ODFhNWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course,” Greatlord Oshiro responded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTdmNzgwZDMzYjQ1YzE5ZDY5OGY4ZDg5NzRmZGU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They sat on the floor in the traditional position of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">seiza</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. They were arranged in a circle, with Amelia across from the cardinal. As Amelia shuffled into position, she chirped, “It’s a pleasure to meet you! I like your horns! Why are they white?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDQ0ZDYyNGU4NTQxY2NiZDY5OGI4Mzk5ZTIxNjJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t know?” Cardinal Hiroshi responded, disappointment evident in his voice. “Even though you wear the cross?” He gestured towards the small necklace Greatlord Oshiro had given to Serena, who had passed it on to Amelia. After a long discussion, Amelia had decided to wear it to the ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjdhNWNkYmU4ZTQwY2NhOTllNzY1ZGY5NDgxNGE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, uh,” Amelia shifted awkwardly. “Wear it out of respect. I suppose I’m still finding my own path, but-” Her voice rose. “There are so many religions I don’t know which one I should follow or whether I should even follow one at all! There’s the Quinto religion in Kenhoro with their worship of the Kami, and then there’s Sangoism down here, whose teachings seem really solid! And I’ve heard about…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDdiYTRjYzgyOTQyZDA4NmMxNmY4N2RhODVlMDVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia rambled for a bit, mostly listing some of the Empire’s many religions she’d learned about from Serena and Tomes. The cardinal listened to everything without interrupting. When Amelia finished, he replied, “You still haven’t found your flock. Well…” The cardinal cleared his throat. “To answer your first question, the clergy paint their horns white to symbolise the purity and goodness of Christ and his spiritual successor, our divine Empress. Although…” He leaned in, dropping his voice. “It originally began as an easy way to identify each other in a crowd!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWVhYWYzNzE2NDQ0MTc5MTAwOTNlNGU3YjRlZGU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm! I see!” Amelia nodded. “What about the hornbands?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTgwNDA5YTc1YjQ5NjliNTkyZWMwNTllNTFkMWI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cardinal Hiroshi reached up, tapping the golden hornbands with a wrinkled hand. “One for a priest, two for a bishop, three for an archbishop and…” He tapped the top of his horn. “This cap is for cardinals. I never take them off, the Empress even affixed them herself! Let’s see… it was perhaps thirty years ago? But if I may ask you a question, Lady Thornheart.” His mouth stretched into a smile that on the surface seemed gentle, but behind it Serena could see the smile of a predatory fish. “How are you finding our Empire? Coming from a small country like Karligard, it must seem enormous.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODE0NTExMTQyMDRhMDA4YmUwN2VjMGZkZGVmMTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena wondered how much the cardinal knew. The overlords were aware that Amelia was a realm-traveller. They would even know she was living in a new body - the Axiom crystal recording she’d passed on included Amelia admitting as much. Did Cardinal Hiroshi know Amelia’s origins? Whether he did or not, it was evident from his question that he intended to hide it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2JkZWJmYjM2NTQ0MjRiNjhlM2E0MTAwODA4NTIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia hummed. “It’s amazing, and I’ve only seen such a small part! I can’t wait to go travelling!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjlmYjk5ZGM3YzQ0OTNhMGQ4ZTBlM2MwNGM1MmZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The cardinal chuckled. “And while you travel, do you intend to replicate your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sphere of Convalescence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” His eyes narrowed as he let the question linger. A cold silence developed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDViMzJiYWU1YjQ0NDM5NjU1NTg3ZGFkNjExNjMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-if I have to!” Amelia blurted out. “No one could look at the condition of those slums and not do what I did! At least, no decent person!” At her words Serena detected the first hint of annoyance in the cardinal’s eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzYzZDY1YTEzNDQ0NWJiZWM0M2Y5ZWQ0ZjAyMDIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were right,” Cardinal Hiroshi intoned, turning his head towards Greatlord Oshiro. “Her spirit is pure, and innocent…” Greatlord Oshiro nodded subtly. “...But, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">naive</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” continued the cardinal. He turned his gaze back to Amelia. “I, of course, welcome the miraculous spellwork your wondrous talent has produced, and I am delighted to see how diligently you worked to assist construction efforts after that unfortunate tragedy. However…” He tapped the Demon Bible rhythmically. “Actions do not exist in isolation. Word of your miracle has reached the human nations, and covert activity against our interests has increased.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGQwMzg1NmZhZTQ5YmJhNzkwNzNkMjBkZGY2NTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?” Amelia frowned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmVhZGI3YzBkNTQ0YjQ5OTQ0Yzc2Y2JiZDdhYzJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fear,” Greatlord Oshiro growled. “They know we’re united. More than a hundred million demons all working for Cascadia’s prosperity. A hundred million demons that are taller, stronger, and more resistant to illness than an average human. But we’re not invincible. A demon on the battlefield dies just as easily as a human. Our medicine improves yearly but still falls flat against the human ability to invoke their healing spellwork. But now!” Greatlord Oshiro rapped his knuckle against his leg. “With you! With your healing! They no longer have that advantage anymore! What if you were sent to the battlefield? What if your existence encourages other conscripted healers to desert? They fear this. They fear it deeply.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGU4MWQwZjg3ZDRmZmI5ZGQyNDBjY2NkMTRmODc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also,” Cardinal Hiroshi added. “The human nations have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">always</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> possessed this advantage over demonkind. They see healing as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">human magic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. They think they are entitled to it. It is, in their view, a divine reward for their heathen faith. One to be used against their enemies, which, in this case, is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">us</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” He let out a slow sigh. “If you weren’t a Speaker it would be something they could ignore, but when they found out you invoked </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to heal so many demons… they see it as an affront to their faith. They’ve already accused us of kidnapping you, forcing you to use your powers.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjhjYzBhYWI1NzRkNTI4MDY4Y2U0MmM4NDA2NmJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that’s nonsense!” Amelia spluttered, crossing her arms. “Nonsense!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWU5MDBmNzRlMzQ0YjlhYjdhOGZhYmM0ODM3NjMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.” The cardinal nodded. “They know it, deep down. However, the framework in which they analyse the world makes it impossible for them to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">accept</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it. It drives them mad, and madness and fear will, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">we</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> fear, drive them to action.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWU3OWY0OTcxNTRmZTliNWNlZDkzN2QyOGRjNjMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The war is ending,” Greatlord Oshiro explained. “The majority of both sides are relieved, even if the outcome isn’t ideal to some. However…” His expression darkened. “There are those that wish to see the war re-ignite into something greater. It is those elements on the human side we don’t want your acts of healing to provoke. Not yet, anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjM3NjRmZjhkMzQ2YjRhOGZiNDU5YjkyNDdkMzE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Not yet, anyway? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena thought. How inevitable was a future war that Greatlord Oshiro would speak in such terms?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmIxZjVhZTU4YTRkYWM4ZjAzMjlhN2Q1ZDUwYTgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I get it, I do!” Amelia’s fists clenched. “But, you can’t expect me to just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">let</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> starving children </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">die</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! I’ve read the vows of Cascadian Lordship! I know what they say; we have a duty to be strong and aid those who cannot be strong themselves! What’s the point in me having this power if I can’t even use it! Those poor children…” Amelia’s eyes glistened, the beginning of tears forming, her knuckles white.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWNiMTdlNGUyNTRhZTFhODZiZjg3N2Y2NzNhMjZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We must balance that duty with our duty to the Empress, and the prosperity of demonkind as a whole,” the cardinal explained.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTMxMjZhMGU0MTRkZWU4YzRiODJmNzBkNjRlNGFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then…” Amelia wiped her eyes. “If </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">duty</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is getting in the way of me helping those in need, then maybe it’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">duty</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> that needs to go!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWU2OTUwMWQ1NzQ4YTFhNTRkZDczNmQwMGJiYjI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...What are you saying, Lord-Prospect?” Greatlord Oshiro asked, his forehead furrowing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjM5NDJkOTNmZDQxMjRhNmIyYTYxMWRmN2Q3NTI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cascadian Lordship is a voluntary process, is it not?” Amelia shrugged. “If I withdraw myself as a prospect, then that’s one less barrier in my way, right!?” She glared at Greatlord Oshiro whose eyes widened at the sudden proclamation. Surprisingly, he looked away, turning his attention towards Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjFhZTBmOTcxZTQ4Y2Q4ZTdiMWRlNjYyMzg4NWRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This is news to me!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena communicated with her eyes, coupled with a quick shrug.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDNhYzcyNzA1NzRlMjQ4NTM0Y2I3Y2ZmZTY1OGY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is no need for such action,” Greatlord Oshiro slowly began. His finger was tapping his leg. Was that… a nervous tick?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTY5NTBmOTY5NDRhODk4ZGIzODlmZmE3NzhkNzFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes…” Cardinal Hiroshi nodded. “We did not mean to put such a burden upon your shoulders, young one.” The two men exchanged a glance. Was it only a trick of the light, or had Greatlord Oshiro’s expression whitened slightly?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWMwMWQ3MzgwOTRkMjQ5YTI5MWViMGI4OTBiMDNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A rash decision like that would only embolden the human efforts to harm the Empire,” Greatlord Oshiro quickly added. “If you abandon your nobility, they’ll see it as a victory, believing they can turn you against the Empire…” Greatlord Oshiro paused momentarily. “...And Lord Halen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGJiODI1ZjMzMjRjNTZiNDQ3NDI3YjJhODI2NWJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would…” Amelia swallowed. “Never…” She trailed off, her thoughts secret.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2Q1MjA5ZjIyYjQ2OGRiNTIzZGViMzA0Mjk1Njdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don’t misunderstand us,” Cardinal Hiroshi hastily began. “We don’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">want</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to limit your healing in any way. In fact, we want to work </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">with you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. We know it’s unfair to feel chained by the reactions of others, but we haven’t explained these problems to you without bringing a solution! Over the past six weeks, the High Council of the Demon Church has been seeking a unanimous vote to canonise you as a saint!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTMyMjMxZjE3ZTQyZmJhZWMyNmU0YzZhOTg3YTM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know,” Amelia sighed, having recovered her confidence.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjYwNDU5ZTFhOTQ1YzJiMzhlM2M2ODc0NTMyNmM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzU2YWNkZWJmYTQ3ZjFiNGRhODE5ZjQxYTU1ZTM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She knows,” Greatlord Oshiro said, giving Serena a glance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzMwNzIyNzA4MDQ1YmU5YTEyNThiOTkxMzI4MTBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And… what do you think about it?” the cardinal asked. “Your lack of faith in the Demon Church isn’t ideal, but…” He glanced towards Greatlord Oshiro. “Given the alternatives, an exception can be made. Your respect and adherence to the principles of good will be enough to quell any dissent.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjdhZjZmNDk3ODQ1YTFhMzY0YmM0YzQ1MjdjMGEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How… would it solve the problem?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTUzN2JkM2I3NjRmMmQ5YWQ1ZDg3ZGIzZThmZDI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah.” The cardinal sat up, his face returning to an easy smile, devoid of the prior concern and worry. “The Church is explicitly a non-military institution. Although we have chaplains serving, they are forbidden from doing any fighting. The human nations know this, and despite their heretical beliefs about Christ, they respect it. If we canonise you, we can make a firm international declaration that you won’t be deployed on the frontlines. That’s what they ultimately fear at the end of the day. This way, we can minimise their outrage while enabling you to continue your healing work. Furthermore, the Church can provide organisational expertise and funding to help coordinate these events, so that-”</span></p><span class="cjQyNDdjYjIwYjk1ODQ5MWE4YTgwYTQ1ZGVlNTliMWVj"><br/>Unauthorized duplication: this tale has been taken without consent.

<p class="cnNmYTUwMzRkNzhiOTQ1OWFhNGQ4NDFhOTVkNDE3Njk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to be worshipped,” Amelia interrupted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzczY2UwZDExZjQ0Zjk4OGRjMTgzZjlkMDljNDdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2YxN2FjYzE4NzQxYTE5MjI3MzQwOWZkNThiMzhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to be worshipped,” Amelia repeated. “I don’t want to have people revering me, kneeling before me, or smothering me with gifts and gratitudes. I just want to be me. Amelia. That’s all I am. Nothing more, nothing less! I don’t want to stand before a crowd of believers and give grand speeches. I don’t want to live a life smothered by obligation and duty. Sorry! I’m too selfish for that!” Amelia laughed. “Isn’t that funny? A </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">selfish</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> saint!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjYzZWVmZmFmMjRiNDU4YWQ5ZjI0NTQwMTk0OWZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia chuckled and a long silence developed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDIwMDg3NWZkODQ1MDI4NDExZmM4NDllMzgxZDgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s… amusing,” the cardinal eventually murmured. “If someone came to me and said what you had, after spending a month dedicating their time and energy to rebuilding people's homes… if they came and said they were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">selfish</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…” The cardinal shook his head. “I would tell them they weren’t selfish, they were only </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">demon</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. But I guess the wording for you should be that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you’re only human</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Ha… that feels funny to say.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2QyMGUzMzI4YzQxODZiNTJkMmNiYTBhNGVjMzk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only human, right?” Amelia said with a smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTMxN2U2ZmYwOTRmYTY4MzMxMWY4ZmQ1MWJiODNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The cardinal gripped the Demon Bible, closing his eyes for a few seconds and then opening them. “I’ve been humbled, Lady Thornheart. I feel like I’ve spent too much time in church politics, too much time giving sermons to hundreds if not thousands of followers, and I’ve forgotten how individual we all are. As you put it, what’s the point in having the power to heal if you can’t use it? Or using it at all when it brings guilt?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmY2ZTJmMTFhNDRiMDc4YjY2ZGE2Y2Q0OThjNWY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The cardinal sighed. It wasn’t a sigh of annoyance, but one of sympathy. “Allow us to canonise you, for the sake of both you and Cascadia. We’ll do it quietly, and announce it formally once you’ve left the East. There shall not be any obligations imposed upon you. You won’t be made to speak to the masses, or commanded to use your magic. My only request is you warn nearby Church authorities the next time you decide to cast anything of similar magnitude to last month's event. And…” He tapped his Demon Bible, before reaching out with it. “Please at least read through this, even if you don’t formally convert. It’s unbearable to me to have a soul such as yourself be ignorant of the teachings. Unlike the human church, our bible contains both the Humanic and Demonic Testaments. There are good stories in there, believe me.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDgzZWY2YzNhMzRiNjA4YTI0N2IxMmZiZjYyZTg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay!” Amelia, seemingly cheerful again, reached over and took the cardinal’s bible. “I’ll read this… and… I’m sorry!” Amelia formally bowed, touching her forehead to the floor. “I’m probably going to cause more problems in the future, but it’s not my intention, really!” She straightened up. “Problems just keep cropping up around me and I have to solve them!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTk2NjZkZDY1OTQzNDg4YTU0ZTdlOGRmMWVkMDM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that’s one way of phrasing it</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjY0NTA3ZWE0NTQ2ZDRiZDdkOWI5NmVjODE4ZGNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leaving Asamaywa will be good for you,” Greatlord Oshiro intoned. “You may feel that you’ll be recognised wherever you go, but that is not the case. The Empire is large, with a plethora of powerful beings residing within its borders, and many of those aren’t demon </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">or</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> human. Give it a few months and you’ll be missing from the front pages. Wait until someone provokes one of the animal gods and you won’t even be a footnote. Well…” Greatlord Oshiro frowned. “That is unless you’re the one that provoked them.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjA3YWVjNmM5ZDQ0MTE5NDFjZDg2ZDdlMjY3MDRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">You’re courting fate!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena thought, mentally chastising her Lord Superior in a way that she would never dare verbally. Thankfully, Amelia’s hasty invocation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> hadn’t woken the slumbering god of the arcwhales, Rhaknam. And, bless the moons, her invocation of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> had been controlled enough not to send the Eastern fleet into a panic. Still, there were other animal gods in the world, and it was only a matter of time before Amelia met one and…</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmU1MGU1ZjI2ODQxNzlhZjVlZGVmNjk3NWIwMGVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She would try and befriend it, wouldn’t she?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTNiNmVmYmQ2MjQ0OTVhZjBmMDM3ZmI2YjViODJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Idiot!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzU2YmM3M2Q3NTQ4ZDBhMmUxNjZkMjhkMTIyNzQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Something amusing, Lord Halen?” Greatlord Oshiro asked, breaking Serena’s chain of thought. Damn it. Her mouth had smiled before she realised. Seven hells… since when did she start </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">smiling</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> at the thought of Amelia getting into </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">more</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> trouble!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWNmNzFiOTc3NDRlZjE4MDBlNTMzZWJjMzNhZjY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing amusing, Greatlord,” Serena said politely. “I was only smiling at the resolution we’ve arrived at. I sincerely thank you for factoring in Amelia’s nature in this matter.” She bowed to her Lord Superior.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjI4ZDIwY2I5ZTQxZDk5ZmVhMjI2OGJjZDA5OWVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, well,” Cardinal Hiroshi said, rubbing his chin. “I’ve heard all manner of things regarding the famous </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hellfire Captain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I came in here afraid you’d bite my horns off! It’s refreshing to see such stories bear… little… merit…” He trailed off as Serena stared at him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWE3MjA3ZmNiMjQzMjViYzRjOTc4NGQ4ODMxYjk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?” she asked, wondering why he’d stopped speaking.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjZiN2Q5OTVmNDQ1NGVhNDAzMDQ5NGY2NWRjZjFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The cardinal chuckled. “What a fearsome look you have in your eyes, Lord Halen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2NiNTIwM2Y1MTQ4Y2NhMzEzMWUxN2UyNWNmNTQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena couldn’t stop herself asking, “What look!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzQxZGM0MWQxZjRjZDg4N2U3NDAwOTExMjQxNmI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was just looking at him normally!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWE5Njg1OWE4NjQ0MzNiMTAwNzMwNDIzMDc3NjVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Nothing, Lord Halen,” the cardinal said, coughing into his hand. “Must have been my imagination.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2UzY2M0N2E4NzQwMGY4MzAzMjYzYjAwN2UyYzc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia giggled. “What happens now?” she asked the cardinal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2FlOGI2YWMyNzQzYzFhYzliODM5MjE0ZGRlMmRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will report this to the High Council,” he replied. “Your desire to not be seen as a public figure will actually work in your favour. While we all unanimously agree that the teachings contained within the Demonic Testament should be open to all, including humans, there are several cardinals that are wary regarding canonising a human. Those with such reservations should be pacified by your insistence on doing things quietly.” The cardinal clasped his hands together, continuing, “Once your canonisation is unanimously approved, the request will be made to the Divine One. Normally there would be a grand ceremony in Centralis, where she would personally make you a saint, but I believe, in this case, she’d delegate that power to one of the cardinals. Given your tight timeline on leaving Asamaywa, that individual would likely be me.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzdmMTkzYzhiMTQ4MWU5YzFmMjMwNjc5ZjIyMDFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded enthusiastically. “What do I need to do at the ceremony?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTYxY2RmMGJiNzQyNDJiMjAxODFmOGM1ZDQ2NWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ll need to wear all white, but we’ll provide that clothing for you.” The cardinal frowned. “Normally we’d paint your horns white, but given that you don’t have any I suppose we’ll skip that step, and… hmm…” He mumbled to himself for a moment regarding ceremonial procedure before finishing with, “You’ll be permitted to have a witness of your choosing. Their role would be to sign their name in the Holy Register of Witnesses, pledging that you undertook the canonisation with your full consent.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTExNjU3ZTkwNzQzZjA4NGU0NDBkNDIwNTU1MWI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He had barely finished speaking before Amelia’s head snapped toward Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjFlZTQ1NTAzNzQxNjRhMmJkYWEyOGVmM2VjZjkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena resisted a sigh. “Representing House Halen, I would be willing to be your witness, Amelia.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTU0NjlhMTM1MjQ5N2NhNDY3ZmQwNTI2OTBjN2U5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Awesome!” Amelia flashed a thumbs up. “What about Aiden?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzViZTFkNjVlYjRkMmI5NzQxNTM5MTYyYTJmNWNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aiden?” Serena asked. Why was Amelia bringing him up now?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjZiYTBhYmI1MTRkZGFhMjM2MGFkMTI4NTk2ODAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s in Asamaywa, isn’t he? I haven’t seen him yet, so why don’t we go out for a drink after to celebrate my canonisation?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzQ5YzAyMDYyNjQ3ZmI5NjY0NDI2YjkxYWQ5YzBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ack! Ahem! Ack!” The cardinal choked on air for a few seconds before a burst of Amelia’s healing magic ended his suffering. “T-thank you, Lord-Prospect. What a miraculous feeling. I feel ten years-” He shook his head. “No, one moment! Surely you don’t mean to celebrate </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">becoming a saint</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> by going out and… and…” He swallowed loudly before uttering the end of the sentence like it was the most vile curse word in the Empire. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Drinking!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzcxMzcyNWNmOTQxOTE5ZjM4ZTFkY2E2MzNiOGNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh,” Amelia grinned. “Of course not! I’m only jesting!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWUyNzkwNTQ1MDRlZTBiM2U1NDYyYTkzMGZiM2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She most definitely </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">wasn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">jesting</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWY5MjMwMTQwMzRlNzU4ZDg2MDFlZWI4YTlkY2Fh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank the seven hells for that,” mumbled the cardinal, as he patted his knees. “I suppose it’s better for all of us to approach this matter with a little humour, yes?” Even as he spoke, Serena felt like the cardinal was convincing himself as much as anyone else.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjFmMDI3ZjY3ZjQxZmY5NGUzMWViOTE1ZWNhMjdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think so!” Amelia giggled. “You’re not anywhere near as grumpy as Greatlord Oshiro said!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjQ2YzMxYTEwYjQyZTM5NmE1NDMzYTMwYjdkZmFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me!” The cardinal spluttered with indignation, turning his attention to the Greatlord, who impressively kept his expression neutral.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjE1ZWQxNDI3MzQwNzRiN2Q3ODk3ZjQ5YjdhMzc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Lord-Prospect exaggerates, I assure you, Cardinal,” Greatlord Oshiro smoothly intoned. “She’s merely referencing a brief conversation we had outside, where I explained my frustrations knowing you would be waiting for so long. I believe I stressed how I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">didn’t</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> want to make you uncomfortable. Isn’t that right, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Halen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” His eyes bored into Serena from across the circle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzlhMjQ3NWRjMTRkOTBiNmNhZTllNmVmZjg1MWI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena resisted the urge to gulp. What was going on!? How had this sombre conversation of international politics degenerated into one of invitations to drinks, accusations, and now this situation where she was being asked to lie to protect her Lord Superior's honour!?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTQ3ZDY2YjNlNDRmMmRhNjk0ZTkwOTAwZDAyZTE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh right.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWQyMDNjMmQ1MDQ0NzM4Y2UzNDUyMTVlMjQ2ZWNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjJiMjQ5MGUzMzQ1NDY4OTQzMzYzNjkwYjBiNWU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn it! She might have a massage planned for Amelia, but right after that she would give her girlfriend some </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">serious</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> punishment. This damn cheeky smug human was going to be the end of her!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGVjNmM0NDk1ZDQ5Mzg5MTljODVjZmU0YTMzOTM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Greatlord,” Serena said with a slight tilt of her head. “You speak truthfully.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTdhNDMzNzA5OTQwNTk5Zjk2ZGU5NjQ5N2E4Njgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed to work and the four of them discussed inconsequential matters for the next few minutes. Once the conversation reached a natural lull, the cardinal took his leave. Greatlord Oshiro seemed to be waiting until the cardinal was firmly out of eavesdropping range, before turning to Amelia and giving her a death glare.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDYyMDcxYjljMjRlMjBhMWRlZThlYzVjYzgwZTY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia, apparently, was unfazed and having none of it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWFmMzNiMTNjMjRmMmY5YTY1MjdkMDJjNDc4YTc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmph!” she huffed, crossing her arms and looking away. “Don’t look at me like that! That was just an honest bit of revenge! Serves you right!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTBmMjIzNDUyYzQyZWFiMmE1YWNhMTViMzIxYzM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Revenge?” the greatlord growled. “I am </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Takahiro Oshiro</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Superior</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. What in the seven hells have I done to warrant your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">revenge?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” His expression darkened, forcing even Serena to swallow nervously.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODRmZWJhZTY4MDQ1MTRhOGU5NzZmYWNlZTIyZmY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you keep referencing that thing!” Amelia spluttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDcxMjE5ZWUyODRjYTZiYmFmODAzYThlMmZhZmUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What thing?” the greatlord snarled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2NmZjJmZWM1OTRjMjE5ZjkyZTNiNjc5NGMzZDA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know!” Amelia raised a hand, making a sawing motion. “The… the…” She swallowed before whispering weakly, “...The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">carving</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzQ4ZWI1MTZkMzQyMzc4ZWRmMjA3MWE1ZTc2MzNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlord Oshiro blinked three times. With each blink, his expression softened and the tension in the air lifted. Then, without warning, the greatlord burst out with laughter.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWIwYTUwMzFhOTQyYmQ5YzBiMzMzZmNiNDM4MWE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha ha ha!” He laughed heartily. “Is that so!?” He chuckled, calming down. “I see… I see… well then, Lord-Prospect Thornheart, how about this?” He thrust his hand forward. “Truce?” he offered. “We shall shake on it, like they do in Centralis.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTRiNTViZGM1NzQxNTViNjQ4N2Q4ZDhkZTdhZmIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Truce?” Amelia questioned hesitantly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzVjN2NlODM5NjQ5ZDJiZGVhMmVmNTIyOTdlYmQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Truce.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzFmOGE0MTQ2ZTRmZmY4NWEwNWFkNzllYTQzNTVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“F-fine then!” Amelia shook his hand, nodding happily. “Truce!” she said again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDhjN2EwNGRkNjQxNDJiZTBkMjVjNjZmNDllY2U0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena couldn’t believe what she was seeing. How had the chaotic bundle of blonde energy that was her girlfriend, who did nothing but stumble from one unbelievable situation to another, just successfully negotiate with a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">greatlord!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Not just any greatlord, but</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Takahiro Oshiro</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!? The man so fearsome he could make his peers squirm!?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTQzN2E2NWE5ODRiMzI4OWVhMzFiZmJjMTQ3Njg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amazing! Her girlfriend was amazing! What an incredible talent she had! She could become a politician! Parliament would stand no chance!</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWI5NjY1OTE3YzQ5ZTJhYzY2MDdhOTI0Y2FhMzli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then,” Greatlord Oshiro said, his voice warm and joyful. “That’s one problematic meeting done. Ready for another?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjc0YmYwYTA0MjRmNGQ5MjI1YWFkNzk3ZjgxMTY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-another!?” Amelia stuttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODNmYzA1NTI3OTQxYzFhN2M3MjMxNzJkOTJkNjc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember I told you I had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">two</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> individuals who wanted to meet you?” Greatlord Oshiro adjusted his clothing, straightening out the creases. “There is another, although…” he glanced at Serena. “It would be more private. You can wait outside the room, of course. I will be doing the same.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmYwZDBlNWMwNjRhNDY5Nzg0Njc2MTUyMzdjN2Nk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia frowned before asking, “Who is it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWQ5NDVkMmY1MDQ5MTVhYWFjNGQ1YWVjY2NmNzJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Someone important. Someone who’s leaving the East tonight. Someone who wants to see you. Follow me,” Greatlord Oshiro commanded. He began to lead them deeper into the building. “Don’t mention anything about your upcoming canonisation. Keep to light topics. In fact, I’d prefer it if you kept this meeting a secret in its entirety. It’s only for your benefit, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGI5MjRkMGEyZjRkZjViYmJlZTgxMWE0MjYwNWVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My benefit?” Amelia wore an expression of confusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGQzZTFmMDY1MDQ3MWE5NWI5N2M0OTc3OTE5Y2U1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right. Here we are,” Greatlord Oshiro said, stopping in front of a sliding door. At his words, Serena could sense a lone person inside shift their weight. “You might have forgotten, but we haven’t. You requested this meeting when you first met Chesterfield in Shimashina. Keep it short. We’ll be outside.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGY0NjIzNDI2MzQ2ZWE4NDU5MWE2OTZiOTFhOGE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Greatlord Oshiro slid open the door, revealing the person waiting inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzVkMTcxZTJiMzQyYzZhYjRmNDYyYzliMDMzODdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-” Amelia stuttered. “Polina!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjQ1MGZmYmQ2YzRkMGI4YTc3MjIzY2M1NzQ5NGU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hi, Amelia,” the Federation spy nervously replied, her eyes drifting between the three of them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjU5NzYzY2U0ODQxNTViY2U0ZmQ3ZTY3M2E5Nzgx" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nice to see you again,” Polina said awkwardly.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkM2Q3ZGI5ZjM4MjRhN2ZhNWVjN2RkZDI2ZGYxMzU3"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTRjMjNiNmZmMTQxNjViZjYxOTliNDkzNmJhZTIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia stepped into the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTgwYzUyZmZjMjRlODk4M2IxYzk2MmUzODI0ZDQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll be outside,” Greatlord Oshiro said, before closing the door behind her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzk3NGYyNmQ1ODRmMzk5YmFmMmU5N2IxYTJlNmRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">How could he spring this on her so suddenly! After her expert negotiations earned her a truce, the crafty greatlord went and did this! She would have to plan her next act of vengeance very carefully…</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGEzODY5YjM0NzQ3MDU4OGZkNjJjMGJjY2FmNGJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you… alright?” Polina asked. “You’re clenching your fists…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmFjZDRjOTlmMTQ4MTg5NDkwZGQ3M2ZiNTE4Yjg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no!” Amelia shook her head. “I didn’t expect to see you like this! I thought…” Amelia didn’t know what she thought, but decided to keep talking to prevent any awkwardness from developing. “It’s great to see you! Look at you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDQ0OGZhMjNiYzQ3OTJiZTlkZmNhZGI2MDhlYjFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Polina looked healthy, well-fed, and wore a comfortable floral-patterned kimono. She’d cut her hair to shoulder-length and more or less </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">looked</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the same. However, she didn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sound</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the same. Her voice had an unusual accent Amelia hadn’t heard before.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjkzOGY2MzA1MDRkMmQ4Nzk4OWUwZjkwMDA0Yjc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s my real accent,” Polina explained after Amelia asked about it. “This is what High Imperial sounds like in the Federation. I figured there was no point in hiding it anymore. I didn’t…” Polina looked to the side awkwardly. “...Want to hide anything else from you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWYxYWU5MjVkODRiMzA5NWQ4N2QxNjkzYTRhZjA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia hummed, happy at Polina’s honesty. She grabbed the spy’s hands, holding them lightly. “You look well! I was so worried they were going to, you know…” Amelia nodded towards the closed door. “Do horrible things to you because you were a spy!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjhjODViYTZjYjQwMmI4OWVlZWVkZTNmMzA4N2Ri" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, no… that didn’t happen,” Polina sheepishly answered. “Everyone was rather polite.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmZiNGVlNGY5NTRmMjNhZDUyYmI1NDg0YTViMmU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, tell me then! What happened after we left!? I hope you weren’t confused!” The original plan had been for Amelia, in her form under </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, to carry Polina to Shimashina. Those plans were interrupted by the Overlord, who had descended and demanded to take Polina with him. It must have been confusing for her to wake up wherever she did, with Amelia nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDc2MmI3OTg3MDQ0NTdiOWI4ZDFjN2NlYjg0MzM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Things were explained quickly…” Polina said. “After the initial shock, I was made to explain everything about my blessings and then I was taken to some estate in the mountains. Honestly…” Polina rubbed her nose. “It was quite boring. I had nothing to do until the servants let me help them with the gardening… it seems silly, but that helped me organise my thoughts. Umm…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDZhYjkwZTQ0MTQxMTNiY2IwMjI0NTc0YmE3MGU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Polina looked at the floor. “I wanted to apologise for what I did… what I said… I mean, I want to apologise for deceiving you, pretending to be someone I wasn’t. But!” Polina’s voice rose, a touch of desperation layered upon it. “That doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy our time together! Gods, look at me,” Polina sniffed, wiping her eyes with an expression of frustration. “I’ve had two months to think about what to say to you and now I’m rambling like an idiot.” She sighed. “I don’t think I’m cut out for fieldwork.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWU2MWM1ZDM3ZjRhNGI4OGIwYmIxN2ExZmU3NDlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Definitely not!” Amelia chirped. “You should always be honest! Honesty always succeeds in the end!” Amelia understood that telling some truths should be delayed until the right time, but you shouldn’t live your life deceiving others. Every lie you tell someone is a lie you tell yourself and, if you live a lie too long, you won’t even know who you truly are. That was something Amelia strongly believed in. It was a belief from her old world.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTJjYmYwNjMyYTRhNjVhYmIyMTBjMWVlMjY5ZTM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I also wanted to apologise for…” Polina rubbed her forehead. “Look, I’ve been thinking about the events that happened with the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakamoto</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The only reason I was on that ship was because of how much my </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">anger</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and desire for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">revenge</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> consumed me. If it weren’t for you… I would have accidentally killed hundreds of people. So, for that, I wanted to say…” Polina took a step back and bowed in the traditional samino way. “Thank you, Amelia. Thank you for saving those people.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGFmYmU3MjM0NzQzYTQ4ZThhZGM1Yjg1MWY3MzIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay!” Amelia flapped her hands. “It wasn’t a big deal!” She heard Greatlord Oshiro grumble something from outside but decided to ignore it. Let him grumble!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzE5YjA1YTFlZTQzN2M4OWJlNWVjNWNkOGIzNTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The irony hasn’t been lost on me,” Polina continued. “That in my pursuit of vengeance against… that woman…” It seemed Polina still wasn’t comfortable using her name. “That I essentially caused the same type of incident that she did. If you weren’t there, perhaps there would be demon children right now… swearing the same promises to themselves every night that I did…” Polina kicked the floor with the toes of one foot. “I feel different, after having so much time to myself and my thoughts. But… it’s still… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">difficult</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. She’s outside, isn’t she? When I saw her just now… I didn’t feel the anger. Just… sadness.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDc0MWY1NjExOTQxNmVhN2I2MThkYzVlNzUxYWE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand!” Amelia nodded. “I think you and Serena, you and me, demons and humans… we’re all more similar than we are different. We feel the same emotions, make the same mistakes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Yjg5ZDcyNzQwMzQ0OGQ4NzlhOTFlN2QyMTRmMzdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And what are you?” Polina asked with a small smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzlkYWY4MjkzMDRiNTlhNjIzZDA4YjE4ODBhNWQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjg0YTdjMTdjZDQxM2VhNjgzN2MyYjA3ZGJkNmRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Human, or demon?” Polina lifted her forefinger, pointing towards her own eyes. “Your eyes,” she said. “They’re bright red. Not exactly a human colour is it? Is it a glamour, or the result of…?” Polina let the question linger.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjgxMGNiYTlmNTRmNzhiZWY1ZGZkNDYwMjA0MjI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It's-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZThlM2QyZmY2MzRkZmNiZTQ4ODQ3NmZiOWUxYTFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Careful!” interrupted Greatlord Oshiro from outside the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODlmYTlmM2IxYzRkNDQ4NGNiMWZlYjRiODViODQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah,” Amelia wrung her hands. “I guess I can’t say, sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzczNmFjM2U3YjQ3M2NhMTNhZmU3N2UyNWE2ODgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand,” Polina said. “You’re a Lord-Prospect now, aren’t you? You’ve aligned yourself with Cascadia…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTk2ZjRhMjg1NDQzOGY5NWU5MjlhNzI0NjU1MjAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia shook her head. “I don’t see it that way!” she exclaimed, indicating to herself with her thumb. “I’m actually quite selfish!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjNlMmIzMDE4MzRkNzQ4NDY5YmJlZWJmZTUyYjZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-selfish?” Polina stuttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWZiMjgzYzYyOTQ2YmM5NTMxMjJiOTkyM2JiYjgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! I’m a Lord-Prospect because it makes it easier for me to do the things I want and to be with the people I want to be with!” Honestly, there wasn’t much Amelia </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wouldn’t</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> do if it meant she could stay by Serena’s side and go on adventures. Going with the flow of the Empire seemed to have worked out so far.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDVlZjhkNDJjNDQyZGNhYmU3YTBmOTkxYzMxOTA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Be with? Oh,” Polina’s eyes widened. “It must be nice, for things to be so simple. I wish I had someone like that…” She shook her head. “I have to admit, I’m a little jealous.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGViYmJkZTg3MDQwYzM5ZGJlZDA4ODE5ZTgxN2Yy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be!” Amelia exclaimed. “There’s plenty of fish in the sea!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGFiMjhjY2Q5ZDQ4ZTc5OWNmM2YxOGE1NzY0YThj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sea?” Polina’s head tilted, a frown forming.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGM1NTQ3ODEwYTQ0NzU4NjZjNGZhZDlkYmQyZTgz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh,” Amelia mentally slapped herself. “I mean, there’s plenty of fish in the sky!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTY2YWQwMzllZjQwNmFiYzk4NzRiNThkYzI3NmRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzc5NDI0NDQ4NjRlNDQ4NjU2NjYwZjcwMDAxYTYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nevermind!” Amelia waved her hand, hurriedly changing the subject. “So tell me about what happened to you! You were bored and did some gardening… then what happened?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjI3Y2M0ZDQ5OTRiNDZiZGUzNzdmZTYwM2YyM2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…” Polina’s expression became thoughtful. “Shortly after the ward you put on me ended, a demon came to see me. He never told me his name but I reckon he was someone important as he seemed to be the one coordinating my transfer back to the Federation.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODY0Y2QzMDJhYjQ1YWE4YTQyODgzZWUwYjJlYTY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be…?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDc0MzM1MmNmMTQ4Mzk4OWQ3MDRhNDJkMzNkNTU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He… didn’t happen to drink a lot of mint tea, did he?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGU2MWZmYWIyMjQwYTU4ZDIyMWNkMDgyMGY4NTVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right, how did you…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2MxMjI3ZDkwMjQwMTBiMzIwYzkyMzRlMWZhNWU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Heh. Chesterfield, you old dog!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODVmNGFmYTI1OTRjMjZiY2VjOTFhOTkxZmQ3NGNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ve met,” Amelia nodded. “So you’re going home? Greatlord Oshiro told me you were leaving tonight. Is that right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTkxMjdjOGY3MDRiZjg5NWI1ZjNmMGNjODVmZTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right,” Polina nodded. “From what I understand, the Cascadian delegation to the Federation was able to create…” Polina crossed her arms, reassuringly rubbing her upper arms. “...Rather favourable conditions for an exchange. I think I’m being swapped for more than ten others.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTQ4MzhjOGQzMTQ3MmI4YzJmNTAxOGRhOGMzYTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh! Is it because of how valuable you are due to…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzc1MWU5MzhjZTRiZDg5MDE3MDA1ODY4ZDFiM2M0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My blessing, yes. Us truth-tellers are worth so much because we can use our blessing multiple times a day. Most people only have access to the manufactured crystals, but given how time-consuming those are to make…” Polina sighed. “It feels weird to be valued so highly when I’ve caused so much trouble.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDg1NzYyMzdhNTQxNDdhMmMxYjM4MDRmNWM0OGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will you…” Amelia felt herself swallow. “Be punished when you go home?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWM4YjFhYTIxMDRjNzRhOTRmYTc4ZWE4OGFkNzY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe.” Polina shrugged. “Probably. I’ll probably be under house arrest for a while…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzgzOWRmZjIwOTQ1YTdhYWY5YjBjNjA2YTBiOWE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“House arrest? Why?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWNkMzU3MTA0ZjRlYjQ5ODZkZTBiZjhjNGMzM2U5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So Federation Intelligence can verify that I haven’t, you know…” Polina’s mouth grimaced as she shrugged. “...Turned.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDZlMjMzOTY1YzQwZDdhMTRiZjY5NjhmMDk2YmU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, of course. It was like that. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2U5ZGM3ZWIzNDQ3YmI4YTY3Y2RlNDVkNzI1ZTZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if they try to punish you, let them know if they hurt you, I’ll come over there, and-” Amelia thrust her fist into her open palm, throwing a wild grin at Polina. “Teach them to play nice!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzRjNmYwODEwOTRjNGI5M2VlNzJjMzZlOWI4NTY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahem!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Greatlord Oshiro cleared his throat, loud enough to prompt Polina to glance at the door. The woman looked back, a nervous smile on her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWI5OWQwZTEyMjQ3OTc5ZmI4NGQ3MTJlNzczYTdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think that might cause even more problems,” Polina said with amusement. “After all, you’re a noble of Cascadia now. You can’t go around declaring war left, right and center!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWQ0NWJmNWYzNzRhOTVhODM2ZDI1NjkzZTJhNzdk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, she shouldn’t be doing that.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjI4MTU5ODVmZjRhNjY5NGNjOTg4ODdlYjNmMTRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But…” Polina shuffled on her feet awkwardly. “There you go again, going to such lengths to protect me. I don’t understand why? We barely know each other…” Polina glanced at Amelia before briefly looking away.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmQ1MTFlZGJjNTQwNGE4YjAwOTA4MzEzOGQ4ZTVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">My, was there a tinge of redness on her cheeks?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTdhMzhhZGM2OTRlMWI5ZjdlYWMyZGI3NWVkMmZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia suppressed a giggle, forcing herself to be serious. “I know it must seem weird. Believe me, it was difficult to explain it to those around me as well,” Amelia began. It </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> hard to explain how reliable she felt her game-enhanced intuition was. She’d had more than a few discussions about it with Serena and even then her girlfriend struggled to get it. “Look, I admit I was a little… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">manic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> at the time. I had, you know… Spoken a Word, and the power it gave me made me feel a tiny bit drunk. I wasn’t in my right mind! Even so, I behaved how I did because I truly believe you’re a good person, Polina!” Amelia flashed her best you’re-a-good-person smile. “Even though you did a terrible thing, you did it because you’d become trapped in this cycle of negative emotions and revenge. You understand that, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2FlZTFjNjhjOTQzZWE4NDJjMTc2OThiZmViNDdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Again, you make it seem so simple,” Polina said with a gentle smile. “Years of anguish my end, summed up so easily by you. Oh!” She put her hand up. “I’m not saying I’m insulted, only that it’s strange to see your point-of-view on something I thought I understood fully. Even so, I doubt… that woman feels the same, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGVhZTU3ZjFmOTQyZmY4NDMxNmVmZDEyMzQ0YzE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…” Amelia mumbled her answer. Despite her best efforts, Serena was adamant that she would never forgive Polina for her actions. Amelia </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">understood</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she really did! She didn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">need</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena to see eye to eye with her on everything. Only… Amelia sometimes wondered if Serena’s attitude might change if she could see into the Shimmer and with that witness the goodness in Polina’s soul.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTIxNDg2OGI3NTQ2MDBhYTk2ZmY3NDgyMmIwN2U1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While Amelia hadn’t cracked the hint the Lord Guardian had given her regarding finding her shadow, she had become extremely adept at seeing into the Shimmer with greater clarity. Even now, she could see Polina’s soul glistening brightly, and, while she wasn’t anywhere near the level of perception she had under </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she could see the two smudges on Polina’s soul that denoted her two blessings.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmY4YzMzZDU4OTQwZjg5MzUzNWE1YjNkYWFkNTc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Regardless… I heard the war is ending soon,” Polina said softly. “At least, with it over, mistakes like this will stop happening. Who knows, one day you might visit me in the motherland. Ha!” Polina chuckled. “Sorry, I’m rambling again…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzZmNTAyNjNiZDRmZTU4OTc1NzRiNmUwZDlkZDE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no!” Amelia exclaimed. “I’d love to! I was going to write you letters, but so much has happened and my mind was always elsewhere! When I finally sat down, I couldn’t put my thoughts into words... But I tried! I really did!” She had. Amelia had scrunched up over a dozen letters over the last two weeks. Every time she had re-read what she had written, she had squirmed at how awkward it sounded!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmJiYTdjNmYxNTRhNjViYjZlMTJiNzM5YmZmZWY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia…” Polina hesitantly began. “Are we… friends?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjY3Y2RiZDYzNzQ4NzNiNmVhZmVkY2QxZWE4ODIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Were they friends? Amelia thought they were initially, when Polina had ‘accidentally’ met her in Kenhoro under the persona of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Tatiana</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. No matter how many times Serena told her Polina had deceived her, Amelia couldn’t deny the genuine happiness she sensed in Polina’s expression when they explored the markets together. In that sense, they </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">were</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> friends.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjUxYzY5NGQyOTRjN2Q5MGE2MDRiYzExMWNiM2Fj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But then, as the weeks ticked by after Amelia had calmed down from her embodiment of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, she had started to feel differently. After all, Polina had tried to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">kill </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">her girlfriend. The only thing was… in contrast to the two Speakers who attacked them in the Kenhoro cafe, Amelia couldn’t sense the same level of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">conviction</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Polina’s attitude. Those Speakers had wanted to kill for sadistic and selfish reasons, but Polina’s desire to harm Serena was superficial, built only on the shaky obligations she felt from a misunderstood event that had tied the two women together by fate. </span></p><span class="cmVjYWI0MDcxYTBlOTQ0OTU5MDIzNjY3OTg0OGRiYTQ2"><br/>If you find this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen.

<p class="cnM1ODFkOTc3MzRlMDQ4NmM4ODY5NTJhMzM1ZTBkNTM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">If a friend lashed out in a way you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">knew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was uncharacteristic of them, doing no actual harm at the end of the day and then admitting their mistake later… could you still be friends?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGE0ZDQxODQ2MTQ0ZDc4NTJmNWRjOTcyYjBiYjcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know,” Amelia said honestly. “But I believe we can be! We might be standing on two different sides, but even if there’s bad blood between two parties, and even if we end up fighting in the future…” Amelia swallowed, feeling a strange sense of sincerity build within her. “I truly believe we can all live together as long as at least one person from each side is willing to cross the line and be friends! So! With that in mind!” Amelia thrust her hand forward. “We can be friends!” She flashed her best let’s-be-friends grin and said, “Hi! I’m Amelia, do you want to be my friend?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTJhMDcyOTRmYzQ5NWZiNjVjZDRhODIwOGVjNjVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Polina's eyes widened, and her eyes flickered between Amelia’s eyes and her hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjU0ZjgxYzE2ODQwZDE5YTU1MTZiYmJkYzRhMjc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">H-hurry up!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia thought desperately. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Or it’s going to get awkward!</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhZjA3ZWFhYTc3MjRkOThiOGQ0NjVkNzBlNWU3MWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Fine,” Polina muttered, slowly reaching out and grasping Amelia’s hand. “Hi Amelia, I’m Polina. ” She raised her eyes, meeting Amelia’s gaze. “Let’s be friends.” Polina shook her hand before adding, “This is very awkward, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTBhMTI0NjAxZDRjN2Q4NWZkNWEzNTU4MjRjZmM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tremendously!” Amelia chirped. This was why she preferred hugs! At least then you don’t have to make eye contact in situations like this!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTA4NzFmZmM5MTQxMmNhNWEzYzZmMmQwN2E2NmVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia giggled, followed by Polina’s soft laugh.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDRlZjg1MDkxNjRmNTlhYzJlMGY5NmIwZGM2MzVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was always told you’d return to the Federation,” Amelia said. “But I think a small part of me hoped you would somehow… stay. It seems silly, I know, but I thought that if someone like you, who held such biases against demonkind, could learn to live with them, then it would somehow fix everything.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzU0MTA2N2MwNTQxMDM4Zjk4NWRhYmM4NTRiMmRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A little naive,” Polina said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2MwZTk2MTJkZTRiNDVhNjA1OWVmOTcxZTgzMTll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Amelia shook her head. “It’s not naivety, but idealism! They are similar, but not the same! If we don’t have ideals to work towards, we’ll never be brave enough to achieve our greatest goals!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2UzMzg3YzQ5ODQ5NzA5YzhmZTQxMTAyMDkzNTc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And…” Polina’s eyes narrowed. “Your great goal is… what? Demons and humans living in peace?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTFiMGFhNWJlNDRhOTA4ZDJlMTk3ZDc3NjAxNTc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia hummed, nodding enthusiastically. “It seems like a worthy ideal, doesn’t it? Even if it never comes to pass in our lifetime, I can at least help inspire more friendships like ours! And if my…” Amelia gave a twirl, using every bit of her dexterity to make it as elegant as possible. “If my adorable charm and healing isn’t enough, then I’ll just beat up everyone who refuses! Ha!” Amelia laughed. “I’m joking, but you get my point!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjVkMzRhODNjYTRiOTBhMTJiYjgyMzdjMTBiZmRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank the moons for that,” Polina replied. “I heard they call you the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Golden Healer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> now, but I’m worried that’ll become the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Golden Terror</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> if you ever get too angry.” Polina laughed lightly, putting a hand up to interrupt Amelia’s rapidly expanding cheeks. “No, but seriously. We have a saying in the Federation. I’m not sure what the Imperial translation is, but it’s something like: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Those that try to hold the sky will find their legs crumble</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Polina shrugged. “The point is, you’ll never make everyone think like you, even if you use force. Even so… I hope you find some success… I also don’t want any more conflict…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjA1YzE1NmEwNDQ2MjY4YTdkZjU5ZjljMzkzYmZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll do my best!” Amelia happily replied. It was a strange but pleasant feeling to know she and Polina, who had grown up in quite literally different worlds and had differing principles and attitudes, could find some common ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODIyYTdjOWIwYTQwODlhNGNjMmE2YzkyODZhZjdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They talked about light topics for the remainder of the time. Amelia shared her discovery of firemint tea, while Polina told her of the cuisine of the Federation, including a sour-salty soup called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">solyanka,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of which Amelia promised she would find a chef to make it for her. After nagging her for a full minute, Amelia got Polina to say a few sentences in Pulpian, her native tongue.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWVmYTkyNDRlODRiY2ViZTIxNjNkZDdmM2I0ZjBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a pretty language!” Amelia chirped, complimenting Polina's vocalisation. When speaking Pulpian with her native accent, the two combined to make an almost lyrical quality.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDVlZTA5MmQ5YjRkODY5NWMyY2IwM2U0ZmEzNTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Strange, I always thought Karli sounded nicer,” Polina said. “Could-” She stopped suddenly, frowning at herself. “Nevermind, we are friends now, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDJhODU5NTljMTQ1MGVhMjM3YjYxOTk2NGNmYTdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia smiled. She was sure Polina was about to ask her to speak in the native language of Karligard, where Amelia claimed to be from. Polina had asked her about her origins in Kenhoro and, if she used her blessing at that time, she would have detected Amelia’s lie. Still, Amelia’s budding friendship with the Federation spy had overridden her desire to verify it. Progress!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjZjMjE5YzdmZDQ5NjRiNDQ3NmZiOGI4MzJmNTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They talked for a few more minutes and then a polite knock on the door let Amelia know it was time to wrap things up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjJiMTI4YjMyMzRkYmQ5NzdlZGFlYTQ1ZTljMTJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for everything, Amelia,” Polina said. “For your forgiveness and your kindness. It’s changed me… in ways I don’t fully understand, but I don’t think I’ll come to regret. Although…” Polina glanced at the door. “I don’t know if I’m ready to forgive </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">… Not yet, anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjFmYjY0ZGViMDRlY2VhNWYwN2E5ZWQ2Y2JiMjli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay!” Amelia said happily. Even having Polina bring up the subject of forgiveness was a huge step forward. “There’s no rush, and besides, we’ll meet again in the future! I’m sure of it!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2Q4NzAzMTJjNzQ1MGY5MmNjMjQ4MTlmZWM1YTVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha…” Polina shook her head. “You know, it’s weird… I think we will, won’t we?” The Federation spy smiled at her. “I’ll keep an eye on the papers, so I'll be reading about it every time you do something ridiculous. If you’re ever in the Federation… come say hi.” Polina smiled, but quickly waved her hands. “On official business I mean, like if you’re part of a diplomatic mission! Don’t just pop up out of nowhere! I’ll get in trouble!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjMyOTgyNmIxNzQzNzZiMDk0YjY3ZTZlM2Q0YzEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia laughed before promising that she would do things properly should she ever visit Polina’s homeland.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjc1MDliMDUyNjQxZjJiYzk4YmVmYzNiZmUxOTg5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shame, it would have been fun to surprise her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2Y4MzNjMGI4ZTQ0NWViOGMxMWFiMjE5NGI1ZjM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a final farewell and feeling satisfied, Amelia bowed to Polina and left the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWM0NGQ1OTFiZjQxOTg5MzQ2MmY2Zjg3ZjI2NmNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could’ve gone worse,” Greatlord Oshiro mumbled. “I’ll take it from here. Lord-Prospect Thornheart, Lady Halen… best of luck.” He stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. Amelia heard the greatlord instruct Polina to follow him through the building, and Amelia listened until their footsteps became faint.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YThiNWI4Y2FlODRkNGY5MTY4ZGQxZTg4OTAxMGMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go,” Serena said. “You handled that well. Not that Miss Volkova was going to try anything. Still, you didn’t let anything serious slip. Well done.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGJkNDcwZWY4NTRlZDFhNWQxNmI1OTM1ZWQ1ZGU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks! Also… what’s that?” Amelia asked, nodding towards the papers in Serena’s hands.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGU5MGRlMDkzMDQzZDBiMTE1MmFiOTVjNDgzOTk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your deed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzNjZTA0ZGU1ODRjMWJhOTRjZTRiOTBlNTg0Mjkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Deed?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjlhNjgzMzJlZTQ5MGY4Mzg1NjI4MDQxMjcyODNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“To your new estate, formerly owned by Lord Kanamori.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTgxYzZmYjJkYTQyOTFhNzk5ZDg3ODkyMzc2OTYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh!” That’s right! She owned a house now!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmQzZTI2YzFiZDQwODZiOWE2OTY1MzJiOGQ5MTFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it really mine!?” Amelia chirped.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWViNGUxNmJiOTQ5NWNiYzBkOTIxYWQwNTIzN2Rj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Serena said, her mouth curling with a smile. “Here.” She passed the documents and Amelia skimmed through them. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzM5MzE3ZDA4MTQ4Nzc4ODBkYjQyNTVjNzAwMTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She owned a house!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODdlODg1YWNiYzQ5ZDc4M2FlOTViYmQ4M2RjNWFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can we…” She swallowed. “Can we check it out?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTFmNDcyNWJkNzRjMDM5ZWRjOTEyNmYwZDYxNmI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now?” Serena glanced at the dark sky. “I guess we can.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjc3NjIxOGIxNjQ2OTY4Y2VlYmY3MWU0ZDUzYjU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They left the ceremonial grounds and headed to the address. Amelia’s new estate was in a neighbourhood elevated above much of the city. From the neatly maintained buildings, this was clearly one of the more affluent parts of Asamaywa. High quality aetherlights kept the streets well lit, and even the paving stones had decorations etched into them. A tram was moving down the street, following the metal tracks embedded into the stone. As a steam-powered vehicle passed, Amelia saw it was labelled as private.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2U3MzczMGFlODRjYmZiOTU3ZjU2ZjgzODEwODc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose it’s only for residents to use,” Serena mused.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzYyMjg1ZTA1OTQzODA5MjUyMmFjM2QxMDFhZGI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They walked for a few minutes, passing estate after estate, eventually arriving at a large entrance. It was the gated entrance to Amelia’s house, and what a gate it was! Thick red-coloured wood had been used and the beams were embossed with silver and shining brass forming shapes of ornate flowers. It was as if Lord Kanamori had been trying to communicate his wealth to his visitors and guests from the moment they arrived.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmFiZTM1ZjA0MzRkZjU4NjRhNjAxYmNhZTM5Njhj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is it,” Serena said, pushing the gates open and revealing an unlit garden and a silent house. Amelia flared her aether, but could sense no one else on the premises.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmM2NDE0YjkxNzQ4MWE5YWE3MjQzOGZmMWVjNzNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They passed through a small but immaculately kept garden, the gravel paths winding through arched structures that had vines and flowers flowing through them. They passed over a small bridge, where for the first time since coming to this world, Amelia saw brightly coloured fish! Real, swimming fish!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmY3NWE2ZWIxNTQ2Njg5OTk2YmY4NjYwNGM0MGM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fish!” she exclaimed, excitedly pointing. “It’s the first time I’ve seen them!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDA0NWE0NGUwNzQxZDhhZGFkYTY4YTkxOWVjNDRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Water</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">fish,” Serena corrected. “Fish fly, but somehow these ones don’t have that ability. So we call them waterfish. Can you imagine living your whole life in water?” Serena shook her head. “I think they look weird… and they feel strange. They’re slippery to touch. You said they were common where you came from?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2Q3ZGRhNmQwNzQyNzI4ZmIyY2ZkN2E0NGE2YzNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded. “Remember the enormous oceans I told you about?” In Amelia’s old world, the rise of the second industrial revolution in the late third millennium had, along with the total melting of the planet's ice, caused a devastating collapse of sealife. However, many centuries later, her planet’s ecosystem had recovered and there were all kinds of incredible species swimming in the seas! They’d even managed to resurrect the mighty blue whale a century after the tiger returned!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTc1N2Q3OTNlNTRiZDVhZTVlZThkNTcxZTNlYzRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d explained it before to Serena, but her demon girlfriend struggled to imagine an endless stretch of water that was larger and heavier than the floating continent of Cascadia. Although Amelia had fun acting out the motion of waves to try and help explain how the Moon affected the tide. It was another little moment where Amelia realised that things that were normal in her world were abnormal here, and vice-versa.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTZhMzcyMDFlODRjNjViOTRlMDQ0YTg0ZDFjOGM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena nodded, and together they continued towards the house.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Mjk0M2Q5ZDk4MjRiYWY5ZTQ5NTExMjEwYTJlZjAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia fell in love with it immediately. It had one floor and was constructed in a square shape. The center contained another small garden and a small structure that served as a teahouse. The main building had empty walls and bare floorboards, making their footsteps and voices echo. It would feel completely abandoned if it weren’t for how clean everything was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWNhZWZiZmY2ZDQ0ZDRhODVkOTFiNTBhZTg3ZWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena led Amelia through the rooms. She not only had her own reception room to receive guests but also a bedroom, toilet, and kitchen! There was a room that would make a good office, and another which, as Amelia envisioned it, would make a good lounge.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjM2ZDM4YzIxNzQwYTViN2FhYjk0ZjkyZGEyOWU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a few more buildings on the grounds. A small bathhouse was attached to the main building, accessible only through her bedroom. There was also a guesthouse, which had its own toilet, reception room, and bedroom. Finally, a small building served as both storage and the servants' quarters.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2QyYzg0M2UyYTRkZTBhM2UwZmIzZjQ2MzQxMjgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to have to hire people to look after the place while I’m away, right?” Amelia buzzed around, almost not believing that this was all </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hers</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! Would she get rewarded like this every time she helped </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">reeducate</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a corrupt noble?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWRkYWU3M2ZjYTQ4Y2RhODcwZWFjMTUzZjY1YmQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was good business!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGQ2ZDNmYTNkMTQwMDA4NWI0Yzc0MGQ2NGQ0OWY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll recommend people,” Serena intoned, looking through cabinets and inlaid wardrobes lining the walls of Amelia’s new bedroom. “It’s a good house. Not too big, and not too small. We can always send over people from our estate on a temporary contract. Oh-” Serena reached up and pulled out a large futon. “They left some stuff behind. This is a nice futon! I miss sleeping on these. I’m either in a hammock or a bed these days…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGViNmMwNDRkOTRkYzM5ODJmNzI3MmE1NGI3MzM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, Serena stood there, holding the futon and looking at Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDAxZjk0NDIxMDQ2M2M4MjQ1Y2NiMTdlYTUxZThm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And Amelia stood there, looking at Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2ZkMjJlMDYzMTQ2ODI5Mzg4Yjg2MjY4YWJkZjE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The same thought went through their minds.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWU4Y2VkZTYwNjQyNTliOWFjZDQyMmM2MThmNDE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahem!” Amelia cleared her throat. “Well, it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> getting late…” She walked up to Serena, placing a hand on her new futon. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Halen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, you must be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">awfully</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> tired from looking at a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">certain</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> individual all day! I couldn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">possibly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> allow a lady such as yourself to walk home on such a dark and dangerous night! I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">must</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> insist you stay until tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2RjMWQ2ZWMzZjQ0YjFiNDQ4M2QwZGNjOWY4OTAy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh?” Serena rolled her eyes. “But there’s only one futon, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. What in the seven hells are we to do?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjA4MTgwYjQzYTQ3Y2U5OGE4Mjc0YTkzYWQxZDc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia giggled. “Well, it’s the host's duty to make sure her guests have a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">satisfactory</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> night, isn’t it?” She took the futon and laid it down. “Don’t you worry, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Halen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, this humble host will make sure that- mmph-!” Amelia was cut off as Serena kissed her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODI3ZmM5OWU4MzQ4YTM4ZTk5NTQxNjc0NDI4OWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGEyMWQxMjllNzQ0NDFhNTdiZDM3MmM5ZGYyOTQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWUwMzEzNzQ1NjQ2MWU5NTUwNTQxY2FiMGY4MzAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzA1NWU1NGEzNzRmNTZiNmE5YzdkMmNiYTZjNzM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my,” Amelia whispered, feeling her face heat up. “My first-ever guest seems to have some unconventional </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thoughts</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> regarding tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2FmYTg1N2Y2ODQ0YjBhMzI0MDA5M2U2NDU5ZmIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up,” Serena said, pecking Amelia on the lips again. “It’s been a while, hasn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjI3MzBlMTg5NzQwNzg4ZjY3YTk5MDIyNmUzMWU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia took a step forward, slipping her hands into Serena’s sash, snaking her fingers around to hold her lower back. “And what…” she whispered, “would you like us to do?” She ended her question with a gentle kiss on Serena’s neck. Amelia intended for it to be a single seductive kiss, but she couldn’t stop herself from going in again, and again. Soon, she was gently sucking Serena’s neck, running her tongue over her skin. It didn’t take long before Serena’s breathing became heavy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmNjMTAzMjkzMzQyNTc4MWNhNWIwMzYxYWNlZTRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I need…” Serena mumbled, placing a hand behind Amelia's neck, holding her against her neck. Amelia responded by letting one hand dip down, to wrap around the curve of Serena’s buttcheek. Another hand went up, out of the sash and snaking its way through the kimono’s folds until it found itself cupping one of Serena’s breasts.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmVhZjgwMDE5YzRjNWJiZTljMzdkMDE2MmE1ZTA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I need to punish you…” Serena sighed with satisfaction as she began to undress Amelia. “And… massage you…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGVlMDgxMmM2YjRlZGY5ZmVmMjViN2YwYzA5MDRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm? A nice punishment followed by a nice massage…” Amelia moved her lips back to Serena’s, happy to see her girlfriend’s cheeks were crimson. Serena no longer got embarrassed over her cheeks flushing, but that didn’t stop them flushing in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2VlYzI5OWE4NjQ5MmQ5ZTFiMzk2NTk5MTFhOGQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And Amelia </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">loved</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> making Serena blush!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDQyZDE0OWVhZDQ1OWRhMjRjZWE0MGFlZTUwNWVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We won’t have much opportunity for this on the ship,” Serena mumbled, fumbling with Amelia’s clothes. “With Anathor and all… so I need to make tonight’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">punishment</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> count.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGU4OGRhZjA0YTQzM2E4MTcyMTk1MDI4ZWY0ZGQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…” Amelia began to undress Serena, alternating between loosening clothing and running her hand over her girlfriend’s toned body. How could she smell so good? Did demons release pheromones that made humans react like this? “Doesn’t just have to be tonight, does it?” she whispered. “We can stop staying over in the Academy till we have to leave, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjZlZjljMjkxNzRhMjVhNmYwZGJmN2FjYjA0Y2U5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… it’ll look suspicious,” her girlfriend replied weakly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWY3ZmI5NmNiZjRkNTFiYTRkMDI4NDY3NDEzNzA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ren,” Amelia intoned sarcastically. “I think those that can pay attention have started to notice. Didn’t you say Oshiro implied he knew?” Amelia finally unravelled Serena’s kimono, leaving only her undergarments. Such thin pieces of cloth only served to aid Amelia in her teasing. She placed a hand between Serena’s legs, ever so </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">slightly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> brushing the fabric, letting the smallest amount of sensation reach her girlfriend's most sensitive area.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDY4YjgxMGM3ZTRiY2Y4MmIyYTkzYzI5YmZkZDk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia knew that with a delicate touch, and Serena’s enhanced perception from her aura, she could drive her girlfriend mad with this method.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODcyMTJjMmUzNDRkOGFiZDY4MmZkNTc5OGU5MjAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was, she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">would </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">have been able to, if Serena didn’t pick her up and throw her down on the futon and climb on top of her! </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTJjNzY5MDFkZTRlNTI5M2NiNmRhN2E2NzI4NzY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey!” Amelia protested before having her lips stolen.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzlkZjI2OWI1MTQzNWU4Y2JmNzVhOTExMzA0ZDRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh no,” Serena shook her head, her black hair waving mesmerisingly from the movement. “You’ve been </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">extremely</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> annoying recently and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you’re</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the one who's going to have to lie there and suffer this time! Do you…” Serena swallowed, looking around. “Do you have wards up?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzAxY2RmMmY4MzRmMGFiNTE1OTI1YjEwNzk5YzQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Already done,” Amelia mumbled, feeling her heart race. “But… it’s useless! I’ll never break!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzUxNDllNjUyNDQ5OTM4MTQ3ODZlMzExZGJjYTdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You just stay there,” Serena said with a grin, unravelling Amelia’s clothes and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ripping</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> her undergarments off. “You’ll have to ask for it,” her girlfriend instructed, kissing her on the lips, then the neck, then her chest. “Until you ask for it, I won’t give it to you.” Serena adjusted her position, moving her kisses lower and lower…</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjU5YjhkNzhlZjRlNzk5NmIwZGEwNDQ0ZGJiN2U3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But never reaching where Amelia wanted them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzEyMWRkZTY1MjQxNzA5NTRjYTA1YjU5ZTRhYTk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite her earlier statements of not breaking…</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzVkMGFmZmEwZTQ0YTQ4YTA2MTI4NzYxZTA2Yzhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She lasted about ten minutes before shouting out in maddened sexual frustration, “You bloody demon! Okay! I want it! Just move your tongue there and stay there, damn it!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzVlZDAyNjIzMDQ3MGJiZmE0MWM3ZjkwYWNhODYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And when Serena finally relented, and Amelia could relax and enjoy the sudden rampant increasing pleasure, she realised that it wasn’t just teasing she was going to have to suffer tonight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDA5NjFkNmM1NTRkOTY5ZjJlN2Q4OGMyNjk1OGYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena seemed determined to make sure Amelia knew </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">exactly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> how intense an aura-enhanced tongue could be, in both speed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> endurance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTQ3ZWJkMmRjOTQyMjNiNTZlYWQ4ZTZlYTYwNTY1" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m the…</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia thought in between moans, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">luckiest human alive…</span></em></p>

      <description>Chapter Seventy-Seven: Spoken Secrets</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM4YjUzNTdlMmI1ZDQwZjFhZGI5MjI5Mzk2ZjQ3Zjdi"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNmNWI2ZTI4NTM5YTRkNzI4N2VmYTNiNWM1ZDBmNmY2">Serena woke to an unfamiliar ceiling in an unfamiliar bed. What was familiar, however, was the warm body of Amelia pressing against her. She was sleeping soundly, so Serena took a while to enjoy the sensation of her girlfriend’s chest rising and falling against her back. It was a comfortable pressure that brought with it a satisfying feeling of warmth and strangely enough, <em>safety</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNhMmM3Y2JkYzBlNjQ0YzA5MzFmMDYyODE3MTQ2ZmUw">Her mind felt refreshed and free of burden. The layers of stress that had built up repeatedly over the last month from her military obligations, academy duties, and studying for the commodore exam had vanished entirely. Even with Amelia frequently healing Serena, the mental strain would return the same day.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTBjYjUzMzU3ZjRiMGE4MzIzMmJlOTdkMDBmZDU0">Was this newfound clarity… due to last night’s activities?</p>
<p class="cnMyOTUwZTBlYTZlODQzMzZhNTRiMTFjZDFlZjQ4Njll">No! Surely not! What kind of indecent woman would that make Serena, if she were the type to destress through such… actions? Although she naturally rejected that, Serena could admit to herself that she felt some level of pride. After all, Amelia was sleeping like a babe, exhausted and entirely satisfied by Serena’s extensive <em>punishment</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzhkNjg3ZDZiZDRiMjliYmFmNDRkYTcwODU5YTcz"><em>Is this what a man feels like, after…?</em> Serena thought, quickly pushing the topic out of her mind and refocusing on mental revision of fleet tactics and logistics. She remained absorbed in her thoughts while the room progressively brightened as natural light diffused through the paper windows and doors.</p>
<p class="cnMzODU3YzAwZWVlMjQ1ZWZhMDVkZWZjY2I2NGYyMGVj">Not long later, the Asamaywa bell towers began their early morning cries. It was Saturday - the day of Katalin’s weekend session. While a part of Serena wanted to remain in bed, sharing warmth with her girlfriend, she knew the Northern swordmaster would be returning to the North soon, and every session was a tremendous benefit to both Serena’s and Amelia’s training.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDEwZGY2YTU1NjQ3ZDg5ZWVhNmI0ODIzNGU4NGQ4">With the exception of the cancelled session immediately after the Asamaywa fire, Serena and Amelia reliably attended every one. Katalin’s sessions were split into two parts; the first was a more standard training session attended by perhaps two dozen of the academy’s staff, while the second was relentless, consisting of intense dueling and simulated situations that pushed those that remained to their limits.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTQ2NzRmMzhhODQ1ZjA4N2M1MjNkZDRjZDc5YTQ3">Along with Serena, only those with a strong yellow aura could keep up. Other than her and Amelia, the only instructors reliably attending the second part of the session were Ryosuke, Nathaniel, and Joey. Amelia struggled, but that was only due to her minimising the use of healing magic to keep herself going. Her girlfriend had become quite accustomed to pushing herself through difficult experiences, and while she didn’t have the mindset of a soldier, she’d matured greatly over her time at the academy.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2I4NDQyMzk4ZTQ4MmQ4MWU1ZDhlM2FmODk3Yzcy">Not to mention, Amelia’s body had even built a little muscle, putting the sensation of her body somewhere between firm and soft in a way that Serena was secretly delighted about.</p>
<p class="cnMzMjU1NzFlYWExNTRmNjZhZDRkMDc4YTgwM2EyNGJl">And the arms of that body were now squeezing her tight.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzZiODVhZmFmNzRmNmViMzhkMTg3MGNlN2RlZGU1">“Morning, Ren,” Amelia mumbled before yawning loudly.</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2JkYTdhOWI0ZjQzOWFhNjI2ZTg2ZjcwNjA1NTNl">“You knew I was awake?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMGU4M2JhODRmMTQwMWRiZDcwYTQ3OWU5OTc4MTQ2">“I know how you breathe when you sleep,” Amelia replied, nuzzling into Serena’s back. “Wow, now I’ve said that, it sounds creepy, doesn’t it? Here…” Amelia invoked her magic, healing and cleaning them both. “Katalin’s session today, right? She mentioned she would do something special.” Amelia yawned again, likely more out of habit than any morning tiredness - the latter of which would have been obliterated by her spellwork.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTRiMGQxNWZiYTQ2YWQ5MjVhYTY2ODA4OTFhYzk1">Amelia sat up while Serena rotated onto her back. She idly moved her hand and lightly rubbed Amelia’s back, running her fingers through her silky golden hair. “No coffee here,” Amelia said quietly. She turned her head down towards Serena and asked, “Should we-” Amelia stopped talking, suddenly looking away. “Uh, should we get coffee on the way?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZGQwYzZmY2VkNDQyYjhiMWZlYTFjOWFlMjZlOTNm">“Yeah, and some food,” Serena replied. “We can walk slow…” She felt herself frown. “Lia?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ODM2MjRhYWRlNDQzNzFhNDYzMjUxMjE4OWJjYTY2">“Mmm?” Amelia hummed, looking away.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmVmMTVmZTdlYjRmZDA4YWRlMDExZmIxNDE2Y2E5">“Look at me,” Serena requested, her mouth curling with amusement. Amelia was quiet for a few seconds before turning to face Serena, revealing a flushed face. Not only that, but Amelia found it challenging to meet Serena’s gaze. “Oh?” Serena asked. “What’s made you so timid?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNjJmOWQ0N2ViNjRlOTZhZTc3ODc2N2JhMDlmYTg1">“I’m not timid!” Amelia exclaimed, puffing her cheeks out. “It’s just…”</p>
<p class="cnMwNDRlZWYyOWRjYjRhMDg4ZWRhZmRiNGJlNjQzNjlj">“Just?”</p>
<p class="cnNmZWI3ODI3MjY5ZDQ3ODZiMDllM2I2ZWNiNDI4YTk4">“I remembered…” Amelia chewed her lip. “Last night…” Her voice became extremely quiet. “It was so much more than you’d done before…” Her girlfriend giggled. “You haven’t treated me like that since that time we got drunk in Kenhoro! It was overwhelming…” Amelia looked away again. “But also really nice…”</p>
<p class="cnNlZmJhYmI4NzI4ZTQxZGE4NjU5ZDhlYjQyMGNhZjE2">“Ha!” Serena laughed. So that was all she had to do to reverse the deck against Amelia!? For months she’d accepted a relationship where Amelia would relentlessly try and make Serena blush with her lewd compliments and requests. Only now, it was Amelia on the backfoot and Serena relishing her victory!</p>
<p class="cnNlOTNlOWRkOTBjNDQ2MjFhZWU2ZTU3ZDUxMjc2MmJi">All it took was a night-long aura-enhanced assault against her girlfriend’s senses!</p>
<p class="cnM4NWNlZjk3ZDhlYTRjN2NiZjM5YzM1ZjI3MTgyYzkz">“Well,” Serena couldn’t stop herself grinning. “It has been a while, hasn’t it? Have to make up for lost time, don’t we?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDYwMTMzOGM1MDQyYTliZGRlYzQwMDA5OTY2N2Nh">“You…” Amelia rolled her eyes, “Look <em>so</em> smug right now.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYjEzZDVkNTliMjQwYzZhYTUzZjZjZGZkYTc4MmRm">“I’ve been taught by a master of smugness, after all!” Serena reached out, pulling Amelia into a hug. They held each other for a while before agreeing to get moving. They quickly dressed, helping each other adjust their kimonos. They would have to stop by their rooms in the academy to get into their uniforms before going to the session.</p>
<p class="cnNiOGYxMmUxNTdmYzQ0Zjg4NmRjYWU1OGQ5NTJmNWVk">Suddenly, Serena’s enhanced ears picked up the sound of someone knocking; not at the door to the house, but at the unstaffed gate at the estate entrance. The individual knocked out, before calling out Amelia’s name.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzlhMTY1ZjYyOTQ0OTA5ODBlODRmOTgyNzU4NmQ4">Serena sighed. She was concerned it might be a friend or an acquaintance of Lord Kanamori, but it was neither of those things.</p>
<p class="cnM4N2QwMWMwYzQyNDRlZmY5MTJjZjI0ZTc3NWIzYWIz">What was he doing here, so early?</p>
<p class="cnNlNDg0NDVlY2YzMDRiZWM4ODQzOWUyYTgwMWY1MTI5">“As Head of House Thornheart, why don’t you go and greet your first ever visitor?” Serena offered. “I’ll come out in a bit.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZWQ5OGY1ZGFkNjRjNmU4ZGIwNmRhNDM3Y2IyMTFh">“Mmm! Sure!” Amelia nodded happily, her golden hair rising and falling in waves. The wards surrounding the building were released as Amelia bounced out of the room and down the gravel path winding through the well-kept gardens.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzgzNGMwNjIyODRjY2Y4OGQ3NDBiYmEwNzUxMmY3">Serena tied her hair, only moving after she sensed Amelia cast more magic.</p>
<p class="cnNlZmU0NDg0Mjc0NTQ3OTk5YzVhYTUxZDQ2MTQzM2Vm">She followed after Amelia, quickly reaching the gate where she found a very annoyed-looking man knee-deep in the entryway of the estate. Amelia’s earth magic had made him sink, trapping him completely.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjQ3ZDY4YzgwNTQxODliOTJhMGYxN2E3YjU0NTMz">“I remembered!” Amelia declared proudly, putting her hands on her hips as she twirled to face Serena. “To put him in the ground! Remember?” Amelia turned back to the trapped man, lecturing, “This is what you get when you make plans behind our backs! Hmm!? Are you sorry now, Aiden!?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZDMyNTFjOTI3MTRiNzc5ZWQ0NjU2YmUzZjBjZWM2">“...I wasn’t the one who made the plans…” Aiden countered, his voice exasperated. “Besides, look!” He held a suspiciously bottle-shaped gift in one hand. “I bought a house-warming gift! Ah, can you let me up? I can feel dirt getting into my shoes…”</p>
<p class="cnM2MTkxZWUwNzViNTRkNGQ5MWZlYmE1ODNhODljNjgy">Ignoring his complaints, Amelia grinned and took the gift.</p>
<p class="cnMzM2IzYjNmNmE3YjRhNGNhMzY1MTc1ZjdiODExZWVi">“A house-warming gift?” Serena questioned.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjU3YmIyMmVjMjQ5NzQ4ODM2NDEwOTEwYzhiNzI3">“It’s a popular tradition in Centralis,” Aiden explained as he slowly sank further into the ground. “And I haven’t met Amelia since Kenhoro so I thought it would be appropriate!” His voice sped up as the stone reached his thighs. “Amelia, can we do something about this?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMmQ0YmZiNmMzODQ5ODlhN2I0MGQ1ZjYxNzcyMmE2">“Oh!” Amelia beamed, ripping open the gift. “It’s loqua! Blue!” Amelia showed the expensive bottle to Serena before turning to Aiden. “Bribe accepted! You’ll live for now, Aiden!”</p>
<p class="cnNlMjgwMGY3Yzk5ZDRlNzc4ZDI0ZjE2YTg1MGFlNzQx">“Give me that,” Serena instructed, taking the bottle from Amelia. There was no way that <em>Aiden the Drunk</em> would willingly give up a whole bottle of loqua. As it turned out, she was right. “He’s already drunk a third!” Serena exclaimed, pointing out the level of liquid to Amelia. “You idiot!” she said, chastising Aiden. “Who paid for this? Intelligence? Are you planning to drink all the diplomatic gifts you give? Amelia…” she intoned, making herself frown and seem serious. “It’s bad luck to have your first guest be a man controlled by greed and alcohol. Better bury him completely. We’ll tell the Old Guard we never saw him.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZGE0ZWQzMjUzZTQzMGE5MTVkOTdiZTE2OWNkMDM2">“Mmm!” Amelia crossed her arms, nodding. “It was nice knowing you, Aiden. We’ll drink to your memory!”</p>
<p class="cnMzZGQxYjc1Mjk1MjQ3M2Q4ODIwNTBmMWIxYzRkMDdk">“No! Wait!” Aiden cried as he sank to his waist. “I have your deployment orders!”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTBjNmM2MTkzYzRlNGQ4NWRmOTc5ZDkwNTc3ZmUw">He stopped sinking.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGM5OWYxMTljNjQ0ZWY4ODRhODg5MmRlZDZkYjU4">Amelia looked at Serena with an expression that said, “Should we bury him anyway?”</p>
<p class="cnNlOTIxYjlhZjY3ODRhZjBiZjY5NzI0OTEwOWM1YzZj">Serena shook her head. “I suppose he can live a little longer.” She snapped her fingers. “Let’s see them, then.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MGZiOGI1MWY1NDQyZDRiN2FiMjdiOWM5ZWM0NmY2">Aiden fished a thin, sealed letter from his pocket and handed it to Serena. The envelope was addressed to <em>Captain Serena Halen</em> and sealed with the sigil of the Imperial Navy. She tore it open. There was only one piece of paper, and it didn’t take her long to find the important part.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzBiODZhZWEzNjRjNjNiZWUwMzc1N2ViYjcwZjlm">As she read it, she frowned. She was to take the Southern Passage west to the Southern Terra Firma and make land at Ishaq, where she would then receive information about her next destination. The orders gave no information about what she was supposed to be <em>doing</em> other than travelling. They only clarified she was to establish her elite team of recruits by the semester's end.</p>
<p class="cnM0NjZmNzVkOWI1YTQ1ZTZhMWVmMDI1MjQ5OWE0OWIw">If… if Ishaq wasn’t the true destination, were they going to have to traverse the Arakian Desert? Lift engines didn’t work over the red sand of the Southern Terra Firma nor was there any rail network - the local wildlife made it impossible to maintain. The residents of the south had to either walk the sands or ride animals.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjIwM2U2MGU1MzQwNDg4M2I2NDhmMTg5OWNlMzky">“W-what’s our destination!” Amelia asked, bouncing on her toes.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2FkNDdjZGY5OTRkZjU4MDkwZjVjYjUyODEwNGEy">“Secret,” Serena answered, folding the paper and putting it back in the envelope. “What?” she asked, seeing Amelia frown. “These are <em>military</em> orders and you are a <em>civilian</em>. You’ll find out our destination when the rest of the crew does.” Despite their relationship and <em>closeness</em>, there were still lines she shouldn’t cross.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzFlOWJhN2Y4ZjQ4ZWFhYTA4MjgyMjhhMWFmMDdk">“Fine!” Amelia pouted, but didn’t chase the matter. “Can you at least tell me if it’s somewhere different?”</p>
<p class="cnM5MjM5ODc0OGNlZTQ0NDY4ZmMyMWUzNDFiNmRlYzI2">“Maybe,” Serena answered, giving Amelia a sly smile. “On a different subject,” she said, eyeing the half-buried Intelligence officer. “How did you know she was here? No one followed us here.” Serena had been extra careful the night before, flaring her aether to make sure there wasn’t anyone lurking around any corners. With Amelia’s wards of privacy they should have been invisible to the world.</p>
<p class="cnNmZWRkZDVhZGNhYjRmNmViNDY0YzQ4YzNhYjhkNzY5">“Ah,” Aiden mumbled. “You were seen walking into this area, and given Amelia’s recent acquisition - congratulations by the way - it was easy to figure out where you both were. Now, if that’s all your questions…” Aiden’s voice took on a hint of annoyance. “Can you <em>please</em> release me! I want to die surrounded by expensive liquor and elegant women, not buried underneath some noble's estate!”</p>
<p class="cnM0OWU0MjIwNjJmMzQ4ZWQ4ZWQ3MzY4NGFmMzdiNDNi">Amelia giggled. “Okay!” she exclaimed. Moments later, Aiden was standing on solid ground. Amelia's cleaning magic took care of everything before he could complain about the state of his clothes. Before he could thank her, Amelia leapt forward and hugged the man.</p>
<p class="cnNmYmY2ZGQ0OGY4MTQ1MWU4MzQzNjg2NzU5MGE3MGE5">“Long time no see!” Amelia stepped back. “Did you hear about me becoming a saint? Want to celebrate after? I doubt we’ll have a chance to drink much while sailing to wherever!”</p>
<p class="cnM3MjFmYTU4YThiMjQ1MzA4YmU3ZDBhZjdlMWUxNDM5"><em>Empress save me,</em> Serena thought. <em>She’s worse than him!</em></p>
<p class="cnM4YTg5MDg2Nzc0ODQ2MWI4MWY1OThkYzM5ZmNjN2Uy">While Amelia and Aiden caught up, they walked towards the academy. They stopped at a nearby coffee shop, where Amelia brought them all a cup of steaming Jimari coffee. They found a stall selling wraps and Amelia was happy to see they sold a wrap filled with choco meat and a tangy cream sauce.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzM2NTIwNjFlYzQ4MjFiZDI4OWQ1YjVjNzI5ZmFm">They arrived at the academy shortly after finishing their breakfast. Aiden bade them farewell, but before he left, Amelia healed him, citing how haggard he looked. Serena had to agree. Intelligence was putting Aiden through an accelerated course on fieldwork to get him up to speed before they left. He told them he was averaging four hours of sleep.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjRhM2M5Njk5ZTRmOTNhMWMxZGRiOWZmNjc4NDI1">“I…” Aiden mumbled after the golden light died down. “It really is amazing… your magic I mean.” He looked at Serena. “You’re blessed, to be able to access this ability whenever you want… Seven hells, now that I really look, it’s made you younger hasn’t it? You look like you’re in your mid-twenties! That’s crazy…” He shook his head. “No one would suspect that you’re really-”</p>
<p class="cnNlNWExZTAyYjliMzQyNDM4N2EyMjYxYzUwZmFhNjky">“See you later, Aiden,” Serena said, clicking her tongue and guiding Amelia through the academy entrance.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDY1NzZiMzAzNTQ1ODVhOTI2MmE4MmNmOTViNTY2">“B-bye!” Amelia said with a wave.</p>
<p class="cnM0NWNhZTc5NDRhZjRjZGY4MWMxNjY4YjJkNmUzNmM1">“I can’t believe he’s coming with us,” Serena said once they were alone. “Hope he can adjust to life on a ship.” As she said that, she remembered something about Aiden. Didn’t he once tell her he got terribly airsick?</p>
<p class="cnM4YmQ4Njg0YmYwMzRhOWNhZGUyMTIyZWEyNjRkZDkw">He would be okay… wouldn’t he?</p>
<p class="cnMzMjBjNDM5YmEwNTQ2MDZiMmQ2OWM5OGQzMmM4OGU1">“I’ll see you there,” Serena said. She returned to her quarters, changed into her instructor uniform and walked to the training hall. She lingered outside until Amelia appeared before entering together.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzE3NDk2OTQ3OTQ3ZmI5NTYwMmU2Y2I4NmE2ZGRk">Katalin, as usual, was there. She was warming herself up, seemingly not paying attention to them, but Serena knew the highlord’s senses were sharp. Something about the Northern demon made her <em>want</em> to be better. Feeling herself almost unconsciously straighten her posture, Serena collected her training sword and began warming up with Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzkwNzJjZGRjMjQ0NWVhNTAzZDkxZGVmN2QzZGNl">The first session was, as expected, intense but manageable. While a few less experienced warriors had to step out occasionally to rest, the remainder powered through. Katalin took them through exercises, one of which involved forming groups of eight, where one person would stand in the middle of a circle formed by the rest of their group.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjRiZTE4NWVkNzQwNzc5MDNiMTE4NjQzMTI2MGFm">They would then take turns attacking the defender in the middle, who would need to adapt and counter. At first, the attacks were prescribed and done sequentially in a clockwise order. Then, changes were made to slowly make things more difficult for the defender in the middle.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTczZjMwMGU4NzRjZjY5ZjM4NTZjZGNmMDZlMmRl">The first change was the requirement that they had to counter using a different strike each time. Then, the attack order was changed to be random, forcing the defender to rely on their instincts and aura-enhanced stances. Next, the attacks were no longer prescribed, allowing the attacker full freedom on how to conduct their assault, requiring the defender to react instantaneously to a slash or stab targeting anywhere on their body. The final change was that there was no longer any restriction on how many people could attack at once.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTliYTczNWE0NTQzYjZhYTllMzdkOTE4MzRlNjNl">That last rule essentially turned it into a brawl.</p><span class="cmRlMjg5ZmUyODhiMTQ2OGU5ZTcwZGE1Mzg2ZGI1ZTBm"><br/>If you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMzOTEzMmQ0ZWUzZDRlMGNiZmQ2MDY4OGU1MzU3OTA0">Serena was defending, and when Katalin barked the order to begin, she flared her aura into a bright yellow, slipping past the defense of a junior instructor's orange and throwing him at the rest of the group. She twisted out of the circle, parrying an incoming blade away before kicking sand in the faces of her attackers. She didn’t stop and give them a chance to organise themselves, she struck, kicked, punched and tripped everyone she could, striking as often as possible and only defending when necessary.</p>
<p class="cnM2NTMxZTBkNzZhNzQwMDY4ZGZmYTNkNDY5NjkyMzBh">Katalin’s prior lessons on fighting groups formed the basis of her actions.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTViZjdmNTVhZTQwMDM5ZTY1Y2YzNzY3YzlkMGM1">Even as Serena moved, she couldn’t help but consider how much real combat experience the highlord had. How Katalin handled herself, how she moved, how she explained martial concepts… the rumours that she lived a reclusive life in her father’s estate couldn’t be true.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjdhYjBmMWVlZDRiM2I5M2ZmYjZlZDFhYjhhOGNj">Serena fought desperately for another few seconds before Ryosuke managed to overwhelm her, tripping and putting her on the floor. He wiped sand from his face while keeping his sword tip against Serena’s chest.</p>
<p class="cnMxZGRjN2MzZWVlNDQ4NzhhZjc1ZTVlODc1NDZmMzI3">“That was some excellent defending, Instructor Halen,” he intoned. “It’s been a while since I’ve been punched in the face in a swordfight.” He shook his head. “If you fight like this on the battlefield… I fear the next fool to challenge you.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTA4NGQ1ZWJkMDRkMTJhZDU2MjU2ZDVkM2EwNWIz">Katalin called for them to stop and, after checking that no one was seriously injured, had someone else stand in the middle. This cycle of chaos, with a brief respite, continued for half an hour. Sometimes, the defenders got overwhelmed immediately, but other times, they replicated Serena’s aggressiveness and focused on escaping the circle first.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzkxOTc4NGFiNDQ0ZmE4OTMzMTk1ZmFhZmE1MWIw">Amelia did alright, considering her lack of experience. She managed to block a few attacks and even counter before the group overwhelmed her with their yellow and bright orange auras. By now, Amelia’s partners no longer held back against her red aura; they understood that the layers of wards she had backing it made her more than a match for their yellow. Even so, Amelia’s footwork kept letting her down, exposing her to strikes she should have been out of range of.</p>
<p class="cnMyODFiYzgyMGUzMDQ5MWFiMGUzZDA2OGMzNDUyZTlk">As the exercise continued, everyone was tested to the limit. The repeated flaring of aether and quick rounds built up, and soon Serena, along with everyone else, was dripping with sweat and panting heavily. After the third person collapsed, Katalin called it quits.</p>
<p class="cnMyODIzZDZiNGFkYTQyNTk4MGVlZWVhYjI4ODMwMDY0">“Second part! Five minutes!” she declared.</p>
<p class="cnMxODc5ZTBjODhhYTQyZDM5ZTgyMmI5OWJkMTk3MTIw">Despite the impolite nature of the sound, half the room groaned in relief.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzQ5ZmQ5ZDIyMTQxNWJhYTY4N2MwNzA0ZWM1MDVk">“Praise the fell gods…”</p>
<p class="cnNjMWVmZGI2Zjk5ODRhMmRhMjE4ZjJmNjA0NjhiNjYy">“It was like I was on the battlefield again!”</p>
<p class="cnNiODUyZWUwY2U5MjQ4MDJhYjg5YTZmODljYWYxMGQy">“Greasy. I need to eat something greasy…”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGQ1YjBjNTRkOTQ0OWY5YmUzMmViY2Q3ZWM2YWE4">“I’m going to nap before my afternoon class…”</p>
<p class="cnNiYjBmNGQzZjgwZjRmZTZhZmRiYzg0ZTdmNzRlNTI2">While the majority quickly left the training hall, Serena and Amelia joined up with the usual suspects; Ryosuke, Nathaniel, and Joey.</p>
<p class="cnMzZTg2NzFiMWI4ZDQ5MTRhNTExM2M5YTUxYTIwOGNh">“I fear I may need to ask for healing if the second session follows the same intensity…” Joey mumbled, rolling his shoulders. “Although, don’t you think we’ve improved?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDExODVhNzU2OTQwY2VhNjRmZTllNjJiNTNjMjQ3">After a short discussion they all agreed that if Katalin had run that session early on in the semester, they wouldn’t have made it through. As difficult as it was, these sessions were making everyone involved stronger. It was a type of training that Serena didn’t have access to under her regular duties. The <em>Vengeance</em> wasn’t a suitable location for such intensity.</p>
<p class="cnNjZGFhM2NkNjBkMzRkZTBhNmQ0MGJlNDhiNGU4YzY3">Katalin came over, prompting Serena, along with everyone else, to straighten their backs.</p>
<p class="cnM0N2M1MDM2MWE2YjQyOWE5NTM5NjI5YWMwYmU4Mzk5">“I’ve been enjoying these sessions,” Katalin mused. “It is a shame, but with the war ending I have new obligations in the North. The next session will be the last, understand?” She blinked, her purple eyes radiating something. Regret, perhaps?</p>
<p class="cnMwMzY4MjEwZGNlNTQ5NmNhZWY5M2RiZjE5YjE4ODQ5">Ryosuke recovered from the sudden declaration first. “It’s been a great honour to host you, Highlord Driss.” He bowed deeply. “Your skill has reinvigorated my competitive side. One day, we’ll cross blades again and I’ll show the result of my effort.”</p>
<p class="cnMzOTBhYmQwZDUwYzQxZjI4MTZlZmVkZDNhMThkNGE3">The others murmured their agreement, thanking Katalin for her time.</p>
<p class="cnMwMmY3MWJiZTZjNzQzZDViNzdiMmUzY2Y3NTg4ZjFm">“I am most proud of you,” Katalin intoned, turning towards Amelia. “Rarely have I seen a human grow so fast. You have talent, mmm?”</p>
<p class="cnNiYjJjNjk1NWE3YzQzNzFiYTQwYTRiMGI0M2Y5YWI0">“Ah…” Amelia’s posture collapsed slightly, and she twiddled her thumbs. “Thank you, but… I always lose when my opponents get serious,” she said. “But I’ll improve! I promise!”</p>
<p class="cnMyYzQ2MzczOGNhNjRiYjliNjI1MTQ1NGI3NDdmZmZh">“Don’t compare your experience against these instructors, understand?” Katalin gestured to Serena and the others. “They have the experience of the battlefield, and decades of practice, yes? You can survive against them longer than most people who have wielded the sword for ten years can. It is… a good sign.” Katalin nodded approvingly.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGEwZjE4ZGE2YzRlM2NhYTA3YTQxOGUyM2Y2ZWI4">“Thanks!” Amelia smiled, adding, “But it’s only because my wards enhance my abilities. I don’t think I could take more than a few hits if I only used my aura!”</p>
<p class="cnM5MDc5ZTc5YzRhZDQ5MTc4M2VjMDBiYWQzZmYxMzA5">By Serena’s estimation, while Amelia’s first-circle wards were as powerful as a normal mage's third-circle wards, her red aura, despite its magnitude, was about the same as a normal warrior's deep orange. That alone was outstanding, and Serena was certain once Amelia had spent several more months refining her aura it would hold against most warriors’ yellow.</p>
<p class="cnNjYmRhZTk2OWNjZTQ4OGI5YmE5ZWE1YzA2YmYzMTkx">“There is nothing wrong with using one talent to help develop another,” Katalin explained. “Using your strength to develop your weakness is common sense, yes?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMmFlODU3Zjc5OTQ4OWJhZGEwZThmY2JmNzc3NjQ2">“Mmm!” Amelia hummed. “I mean, yes, Highlord Driss!”</p>
<p class="cnM5YTQ0M2Q4Y2QyOTRhMDY4NGY2NjY4NjJlN2Q1MmJk">“We’ll focus on meditation and expelling aether for the first half of the second part,” Karalin explained. “Amelia, you can Speak with elegance, yes?” Seeing Amelia tilt her head, Katalin rephrased. “You might know it as <em>Speaking silently</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnMzOTUwNjk1NTUyYzRjOWI5NDI3YmM2ODdiNTAxMmFm">“Oh! I can, yes,” Amelia nodded.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGQ5NTQwZmRhYTRjMGZiMWI4NDA5NmE1NzRiNTFh">“Show us,” Katalin instructed.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTJlYzA1YmFhMDQ2ODU5ODQ5MThkYWVmN2RlNDQ2">“N-now?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZTBmMjVkYWEyYjQ5MTQ4ZGI4OTQ3OWRhNjJhYWE0">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMWQ3OGEyMjgyNDQyMWNhMjI3ZDM5NzgxYTBlNDhi">“Umm… okay,” Amelia said with a nod. She took a few steps back and closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjA5NzM4MTY1YTQyY2I5NDU5YmI1Y2NmOTVmNzE1">“Pay attention,” Katalin commanded. “The first step is to <em>cycle </em>your aether. By definition, a warrior’s <em>convection </em>of aether cannot remove it from the body, understand? Amelia is heavily cloaked, but you can still sense some of her aetherflow, yes? Notice it’s thick when it leaves her body, but most of it is prevented from coming back in? This is what you must copy. Once your body is empty of aether, except what is required to keep your aura or wards running, then you can Speak.” Katalin cleared her throat. “Amelia, a First-Word if you could.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMzJkZTA4NTEzYzQwM2E5NTA5NmQwMDZiNzFkOTYx">Serena internally frowned. Why had Katalin said ‘First-Word’ and not a ‘Word’. Did she already know Amelia was a Second-Word Speaker? Glancing at her fellow instructors, it seemed they hadn’t noticed the Northerner’s phrasing, instead their attention was focused entirely on Amelia. Serena kept her eyes on her girlfriend, but her mind kept thinking. Did she know Amelia Spoke <em>Asclepius</em>? Did she know she Spoke <em>Suijin</em>? No one had seen Katalin when the fire was raging, but, given her skill, was it possible she was hiding and observing?</p>
<p class="cnNhODBhN2FjM2IzNTQ0MzhhNjNmMzE4OTk3NGMyYWFm">“<strong>Aseco</strong>,” Amelia Spoke, producing a small ripple in the aetherfield that kicked up a few tufts of sand. With the Word Spoken, Amelia’s hair began to shine even more than normal. Her skin radiated a warming golden glow, with subtle flecks of blue dancing here and there, and her crimson eyes became a brilliant blue, an effect that would last until Amelia released her Word.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzJhMzcxNDI3MTQ3OTA5MDlkMTIyMTk1MGVjZWNk">“Hells,” Ryosuke muttered. “I fought a Vatican highpriest during the battle for Gelre, and I thought they were a talented Speaker and mage… but this is something else…”</p>
<p class="cnNjZDg3ZjRmNjQ2YjQ1MjM4ODU2ODFlNzBkYzExNTAx">“I’m not sure our Lunaria could Speak so cleanly,” Nathaniel said, a hint of wonder in his voice.</p>
<p class="cnM5Zjc1ZTVlYmE3OTQ4YTlhMGEwNmRhZDljOGY1M2I3">“Did any of you even feel it?” Joey asked, shaking his head. “If one of our strategic aetherscopes was focused in on her, I still don’t think they would know she Spoke at all!”</p>
<p class="cnMwMmY1ZDM5NTZjODRiYjk4ZTkxNjFiNTJlOTNkMzA3">At first, Serena was amused at how surprised they were by Amelia before she realised that they just <em>didn’t know</em>. It was one thing coming to terms with Amelia’s unusual talent as a mage and budding swordsmanship, but to witness her mastery over the First-Word was another thing entirely. Serena had simply adapted to how powerful and capable Amelia was.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDhjYWMzNmRjZDQwZjViNGE2ODNiMmM4MjQ2YzM1">A year ago, Serena had only seen Second-Word embodiments in photographs.</p>
<p class="cnNjZmQ5NWZkM2M2NjQzNTU5ODgxMzYyNzVkZDA0ZWU4">Now, she’d seen <em>three </em>of them in person. <em>Two</em> of them were Spoken by Amelia!</p>
<p class="cnNjZjEyYjk3ZDdlNjQxYmQ4MDUyYzYxZmJmZGVkMGQw">She’d even ridden the first one!</p>
<p class="cnM1MzFiZDJkZTU5MzRmNGFiZjlmYWQzNzdhMTY5Mjc2">“The walls here are thick,” Katalin began. “They can handle a loud Speaker, yes?” Seeing Ryosuke nod, she continued. “Spend the next thirty minutes practicing emptying yourself of aether. Afterwards, we will see if those efforts pay off. And…” Katalin trailed off, looking at Amelia.</p>
<p class="cnM5NWJkNGRkZDQ1NDQ1ODA4MTljNjUyODczOWIxN2Ji">Amelia was looking at Katalin, her eyes slightly wide. Serena realised Amelia had been looking at Katalin since she Spoke. Had she seen something with her Speaker-level of perception? Had she looked at Katalin's soul through the Shimmer? Perhaps the Northener possessed a blessing that Amelia had noticed.</p>
<p class="cnM2OTIzMTFkOTQ4YTQ4ZmFiNzY4NDUwY2FmOTE4MzA0">“S-sorry,” Amelia stuttered. “I’ll, um, just…” Amelia swallowed and released her Word, returning to her usual golden self. Amelia smiled nervously at Katalin. “I’ll begin my practice now…”</p>
<p class="cnM1MzBjZDgxODNkMDRlMmJiOTJhNTQyMGY4ODYwODEw">“No,” Katalin shook her head. “You are experienced in this method, yes? It’s better to assist others, providing advice where possible. You’ve been assisting the trainee officers in this manner, haven’t you?” Katalin paused momentarily, adding, “Don’t share too much information. As a talented mage, you’ve had <em>experiences</em> these warriors have not. If you tell them all your secrets too quickly, they won’t understand. Not yet, anyway. Understand?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjBiNTI4ZmQ4ZjQ4ZWZiNTNjMjM0MzA1ZTBhMGVh">Amelia was silent for a few seconds, but eventually nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="cnNlODMxMTkzYTAzOTQyYzNhOGRjODk5OWM2ODA3YjM5"><em>She’s acting strange</em>, Serena thought. She’d have to ask her about it later.</p>
<p class="cnMwMjgyNGJmOWVmNDQzZjM4YmUwODI1MjFhY2M4ZTNl">The session on aether control began and it quickly became apparent who had experience with cycling aether. Amelia, with her natural talent, was at the top of the pecking order. Ryosuke was the next best, apparently able to expel nearly ninety per cent of his aether. Nathaniel followed at eighty per cent, with Serena trailing him at a mere forty per cent. Lastly, Joey could barely cycle his aether at all, expelling perhaps one or two per cent.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDQ3YTE1ZDZlOTQxOTliYjBlYTg1ODg1ZWE0Y2U0">“As you can see,” Joey explained sheepishly while rubbing the back of his neck. “Becoming a warrior was the easier path for me.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YjVmMTk0YjBjMjQ5M2E5YWQ4YzA2ZjY2ZmNlMDFj">“Your word is <em>Taruna</em>, yes?” Katalin asked. “<em>Taruna</em> Speakers have difficulty with this task. It’s quite normal. What you lack here, I am sure you make up for in defense, yes?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MzZhMGJhODFhZjQ1N2I4OTJhMzQ0ODNmMjcwZGE0">“Yes,” Joey nodded. “Under <em>Taruna</em>, I never faltered no matter what struck my shield.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOGY5ZTBhOGZiZjQ0OWRhODY2MGVjNzI4MzkzN2Fm">“Have you invoked her in this room before?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNDU3N2I3ZjE2NjRiNDVhYWU0N2ZmMDNjNmMzZWM2">“Yes. The walls hold fine as long as I’m in the center.”</p>
<p class="cnM0Nzc4ZTEwMjZmMDQ5YjI5ZTBjZWE0YWVmMzIyZDQ3">“We’ll do that, then.” Katalin nodded, before clapping her hands. “Gather around!”</p>
<p class="cnM1NjE4YzU4ZDYyMTQ5NWZiZTgxZjIyNDU3YTQ4MWI5">Serena clambered to her feet, hurrying over. Katalin explained that they would each take turns stepping into the center of the room, invoking their Word, and moving to the side. Once everyone had Spoken, she would join them and the training would begin.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTQwNzlhZGEwNDRhZmVhYzYxNDI1NDlhOWY3YzY2">“I will try and reach Amelia, yes?” Katalin asked, explaining the format. “If my blade touches her once, I win. You will all try to stop me. We will keep our auras blue since there are so many of us, and I don’t want to deal with the hassle from the grandmaster if I break this room’s walls, understand?”</p>
<p class="cnMwNDZhOTliMTQ5ODRlNWZiYmNhOTQ2ZDM2MWI0MWE2">At her words, sounds of amusement rippled through the group. It hadn’t been mentioned explicitly, but everyone knew Amelia and Katalin got dressed down in the grandmaster’s office.</p>
<p class="cnMxY2UyYTljZmMyNzQyMDM4MjcwZjJiZGIzY2Q3OGUz">“Question!” Amelia chirped. “If I’m under <em>Aseco</em>, can I give them enhancements? Many wards under his branch improve a warrior's abilities!”</p>
<p class="cnM0Zjk0ODY3ZTMzOTRiMmY5ZGMwZGQ1ZjI2YTU5Yjk2">“Yes,” Katalin answered. “But you cannot heal the others, unless it is a serious injury. Or attack me yourself,” the Northerner said with a smile. “I don’t want to be hit by any of his holy lightning, understand?”</p>
<p class="cnNiODcyYjlmNzdjNTRjYzA5MzY4MGQ1YWU2ZjA0ODMw">“Understood!”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTQ5NWU3ZDkxZjQzNTg4ZWY2MjhlNzg1YjY4MWUw">“Ryosuke, you’re up first.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNjU5YjJkMjUxYjQ3OWY4Y2Y1ZmMzZmZmZWJiYmI4">At Katalin’s order, they retreated to one side of the room, leaving Ryosuke in the centre. After taking a moment to expel his aether, he formed his Word. Unlike Amelia, who could Speak almost perfectly silently, Ryosuke wasn’t quite there, causing the atmosphere to hum in quiet anticipation. Serena knew Ryosuke Yamamoto as a dual-Speaker. He was a known Speaker of <em>Narean</em>, but no one knew his second Word.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2E0NjkxN2Y4ZDQ5ZWU4OWZmMDU2NmU5NzI4Y2U0">“<strong><em>Narean</em></strong><em>,</em>” he Spoke, blasting away the air and sand within half a dozen meters, enough to plaster Serena and everyone else with a thin layer of debris, temporarily blocking their vision.</p>
<p class="cnMwMzE2OGMwMzJkYTRlY2M4ZThjOGZiNzJiNjY5NTQx">The first thing she noted was the temperature drop. Ryosuke’s <em>Narean</em> was not of hellfire like Serena’s. It was of <em>frostbite</em>. His horns were covered in a layer of blue ice that kept cracking off in large pieces, only to float up and vanish into nothing. His skin took on an ethereal sheen and, through his now-green aura, Serena could see something resembling mirrored scales. Unlike the hellfire variant of <em>Narean</em>, he had no trace of black wings, but a cool wind constantly flowed around him, subtly rippling his uniform.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjIxNjIzZTY0MzQ4ZGE5YTNmMzVlYjA5ZTJmNzE1">“Was hoping you would surprise us,” Nathaniel said, clapping his hands. “Still, your <em>Narean</em> is as impressive as ever. Just the other day you were saying you were getting old!”</p>
<p class="cnMxYzkxMmZhY2RkNzQyZDM5MTNjMDZhMWU2OGZlYTJi">Serena found herself nodding. It was an impressive <em>Narean</em>, far beyond her own capabilities. Seeing it, she had no doubt Ryosuke was capable of the sixth aura - indigo. Some gods, like <em>Narean</em>, had several communable forms. <em>Narean</em> offered a hellfire and frostbite form, but other gods varied. Serena didn’t know any martial gods that offered more than two, but knew some of the mage Words had three or more.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTIyZjFkODYwMTQ5MDE5ZDRiZDk2ZDM1Yjk0ZWFh">“Thank you, friend,” Ryosuke intoned, his voice misting with aether. “I will wait for you,” he said, bowing and walking to the side opposite them.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2U1NzgwZGNhYzQwYWY4YWEyY2EzNTAxNWYzM2Uw">“Nathaniel,” Katalin commanded.</p>
<p class="cnM2MGNkMmU0ZTRkNjRlZjliMzU5YmFhMzEyMTVjODc1">“Yes,” he answered, stepping out and into the center of the room. He stood still for a while, expelling as much aether as he could before forming and invoking his Word.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjI3YmQ2N2VhZTQyYTY4OTcwNGJmNjVjYjFlYjc2">“<strong><em>Longinus</em></strong><em>,</em>” he Spoke.</p>
<p class="cnNjYjBiZGQ5YjJkZDQwNTRiZTBjM2Y2YWUzZjYyODRi">A pressure wave slammed into Serena, enough to make her take a step back. The room filled with sand and the crackling of lightning filled the air. Once the sand died down, she saw Nathaniel standing tall. His eyes and hair had yellowed, and his horns crackled with electricity. Like the Greatlord of Kenhoro, Lei Gong, Nathaniel was powerful enough for lightning sparks to constantly vaporise the nearby sand particles. His skin was cracked, but in those cracks she saw lightning and not blood. It didn’t seem to hurt him at all.</p>
<p class="cnNkOTg0NTc3MjlmOTRjZjY5MjFhYmE5YmY4Njk1OWYz">“Excellent!” Joey called out. “But I still know you’re hiding another Word, Nathaniel!”</p>
<p class="cnM0OGE0NWZkZGYyZTRhZDRhNDA4OTMyNzdhZTdkYjE1">“Forgive me for being boring,” Nathaniel bowed and moved to the side next to the ice-cold Ryosuke.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmQyMDVjZjQyMzQwZDhhZWZiNzY4YTlkOGM3N2I1">“Serena,” Katalin intoned.</p>
<p class="cnNiYTJjODczZWUwMTRjNjFiN2VkYzMwMTg1OTE5YjJk">“Yes,” Serena answered. As she walked to the centre of the room, she wondered why Katalin was referring to them so informally. Perhaps the highlord felt that titles were not necessary if they were going to do something as personal as train their Words together.</p>
<p class="cnMxMjQ5YWE3ZjZmYzRjMmFiOGUxNmIzY2NhY2MwYmU0">Standing in the centre, Serena glanced at Amelia, who mouthed the words <em>"Good luck!"</em> back. Closing her eyes, she cycled her aether, encouraging it to leave her body and trying to restrict the flow back in. Despite her original talent in earth magic when she was younger, the years of focusing on martial arts had made her rusty.</p>
<p class="cnNkOGQxNmQ3MjdhNzRjNTk4ODExMmRiMGYzNmEzNWJj">It took her five minutes, but she was eventually able to remove half her aether. Unable to do any more, she formed <em>Narean</em>, and, after only a moment's hesitation, she invoked her Word.</p>
<p class="cnM3MGIwNTM2MDdhNTRmYjY4MGNmZGFmNDNhODAyOThj">“<strong><em>Narean</em></strong>,” she Spoke.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDg4NGVmY2Q3NjRkMDZhMGM3NjIyZTY3N2VjNzdj">The rush of power and <em>fire</em> was exhilarating. She felt the ancient, divine power of the martial god flood her body. Her horns ignited with a satisfying crackle, and the sensation of a new limb, her tail made out of hellfire, returned. Although her wings hadn’t yet fully manifested, she felt <em>something was</em> there. Not that she needed them to fly, she was becoming ever more adept at pushing against the aetherfield to manoeuvre herself in the air.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDBhMTZjYmMxMzQxZjc5YzI3ZGZmNjVlNTIzNWUw">Serena opened her eyes to see the room filled with sand. A quick bit of spellwork from Amelia brought the sand back down, and once she had finished, she grinned at Serena.</p>
<p class="cnMxZmVlNDg3NWZlZDQ1ZWRiNjlhZDU0YzA3ODk5YzUy">Serena couldn’t help but grin back.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTQ5ZWJiNzM3ZjQ1NjNhZDhiY2NkMDliOGI2NzEx">“The fire is strong,” Katalin said approvingly. “Your wings will come through soon, I imagine. <em>Narean</em> is a good fit for you, Serena.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MjI1ZDNhMzlkZDQ4ZDVhY2U0ZDU2MTRhYzk5MDFl">“Thank you,” Serena replied with a bow, taking the opportunity to try and sense anything unusual about Katalin. Despite manifesting a strong green aura, she couldn’t perceive anything about her that prompted concern. Amelia must have seen something in the Shimmer.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTE5MDQ5ZWE5MjQ3NDFiMWUxYWZhZDdjNTllMDMz">Serena moved to the side, where she earned a few compliments from the much more powerful Ryosuke and Nathaniel that made her feel a little awkward.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDdlOTQ2YTlkODQ0YTZiNzY2MWNkODg2Y2I2Yjc5">“This will be loud,” Joey muttered, walking to the center. He didn’t spend any time trying to expel his aether. One or two per cent wasn’t worth waiting the twenty minutes it would take him.</p>
<p class="cnM1NmIxNTBhZDViMzRmNjk5YWFkZmRkYWNjZTYwZmMx">“<strong><em>Taruna</em></strong>,” he Spoke, blasting the room with a violent surge of power that would likely have blown a hole in the wall if he wasn’t in the centre of the room. A wall of pressure smashed into Serena, lifting her off her feet and forcing her to flare her aether against the aetherfield to stop herself from smashing into the wall. Sand was <em>everywhere</em>, and if she hadn’t protected her ears with her aura, she would surely have become deaf.</p>
<p class="cnNjY2VhYzk1YWJkYzQyYzk5NTFkMTAxZGZkMTEyMzhj">Serena sensed Amelia cast a spell, and the sand was once again brought under control.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjk1MDRlM2E3OTQxZGZiZDUxN2MyOThjZDI1NjBj">Standing in the centre of the room was Joey, and he looked <em>solid</em>. Serena really didn’t know the best way to put it. There was an atmosphere around him that seemed <em>weighty</em>. She knew <em>Taruna</em> had an offensive form and a defensive one, and this was certainly the latter. She’d fought the offensive type in the cafe in Kenhoro, but Joey’s Word differed. The man had grown an entire foot, now rivalling the Lord Guardian in height <em>and</em> strength.</p>
<p class="cnM3MGEwM2ZmZmJmYjQxZjg4NmViZWFhZjBlMDE2M2M5">Other than that, he didn’t have any drastic physical changes.</p>
<p class="cnMzMjFjYjRkNTdjYjRlNmZhMTE0OTdmMWViMTIwOTk1">Joey bowed towards Amelia. “No blade will reach you while I protect you,” he intoned seriously, as if taking a sacred vow. He walked to the rack of weapons, taking a large wooden shield. The moment he touched it, his blue aura engulfed it and then <em>hardened</em>. It was as if his aura transformed into a metal, wrapping itself tightly around the shield.</p>
<p class="cnMwNmJmODA2NWRhYTRhMTk5OTIxZWU2MzcyMGQ1YThl">How resilient was that blue aura? Enough to withstand whatever Katalin was going to throw at them? As Serena’s mind raced, Joey walked over and joined them.</p>
<p class="cnM4NGI1YTUyMmVjZTQ5ZDQ5NTRkNjg0YjlhZjhjNWI0">“Quite the team,” Ryosuke growled. “I respect her talent, but can she really fight <em>all </em>of us? Unless she’s going to surprise us with an embodiment, I cannot see us being defeated.” Serena was sure he was exaggerating. There was no way Katalin, even if she could, would invoke a Second-Word for a <em>training session</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmNiNGQwNWY4MjRmODlhNWMwNjE1ZWQwYWExYzky">“She only needs to touch Amelia with her sword,” Nathaniel pointed out. “Maybe she’ll Speak <em>Kanaxai</em> and rely on trickery and illusion.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZTNjODhiNjc2ZDQ3NGI4MjBkNGIzNDk5Y2ExOGZk">“Amelia,” Katalin coolly intoned.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjlkMTNlMmI1ZjQ4YjBhODdhODJmNDQwNzhlMmQ3">“O-okay!” Amelia bounced to the centre and, without any dramatic fanfare, invoked <em>Aseco</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMyZGExYzQ5NWViODQ3Mjg4OGFkOWI4Mzk1Njk0OWUz">She became a golden light that Serena and everyone else had to protect.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmMzYTA0ODA3NzQ5MjM4ZDgwNzY1YWUwNzNiNGVm">“Take your positions, and then I’ll invoke my Word,” Katalin mused. Katalin wandered to one side of the training hall, while Serena and the others formed a defensive line. Ryosuke stood at the front, with Serena and Nathaniel flanking him. Behind them and in front of Amelia stood Joey, his large frame and shield ready to intercept Katalin should she make it past them.</p>
<p class="cnM1OWZjMGIxMTMwODQ3ODc4YzA0MThlMGIwZThkNTEy">“If you haven’t already, manifest blue,” Katalin called, her voice cheerful.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWJjOGZhZGNhYTQ2NDg5Y2MzNjJiMTk1MGI1YWZm">Serena gritted her teeth and pushed her green further and further until it was at the cusp of blue. The expected wall never appeared, and she found with delight she could push into it! It wasn’t the strongest blue; even if she flared she doubted there would even be a fleck of indigo in it… but it was blue! The elusive fifth-level aura that few her age had managed to achieve!</p>
<p class="cnM3NGQ0OTIzYTgzNTRmMTJhOGM2N2M1MjIyZmFlZTFl">When <em>Narean</em> had taken over her body and forced her to manifest blue when she wasn’t yet ready it had almost killed her. Without Amelia’s intervention she would surely be dead. Now, after training with Grandmaster Gu in Kenhoro, and then training back home in Asamaywa under the gruelling sessions of the elusive Katalin of Driss…</p>
<p class="cnM3YTIzMTYyMzk0ZTRhYThiMDA3MmViZmI5MDhlNGE4">Serena had grown stronger! Noticeably, tangibly, undeniably, stronger!</p>
<p class="cnM1YWUwZGU3ZWI5MDRmMWJiMzRmMTRiY2RmZjZkYjUz">“Get ready,” Ryosuke growled from the front, brandishing his sword in both hands. “She’s about to Speak.”</p>
<p class="cnMwOTY1YmQ4MjUxODQ0MjNiNzZkMWJkMWZmOTA1MmFj">Serena snapped her mind into focus. She eyed Katalin, who stood perhaps twenty metres away, looking at them with an easy expression. She seemed relaxed. Too relaxed. What Word would she Speak? <em>Narean?</em> <em>Longinus? Bayle?</em> It would surely be something offensive, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p class="cnNlMWRhMjk1NWFiYzQwYTg5YzRiNzljMWQ1ZGE4M2Uy">Or… something fast?</p>
<p class="cnNlNWU4ODk1NGJiZTQ3OGM4YWNhNWFjMTVlOGFjNGNk">Katalin closed her eyes and Serena sensed the aetherfield around the Northerner hum.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWEyM2M5ODk1MjQyYzBiYTEwYmVmM2UzZTUwMDMz">Like Amelia, Katalin was highly skilled at Speaking silently.</p>
<p class="cnNiOTViNjUyY2IzNDRkYjRhYWE1OGMzN2FjZWIwNTI4">A few seconds passed without anything happening.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTUyZDFhNDE1YjQ4Y2JiMjMxMzcwMDU0MWZlYzc4">Then the room began to hum with energy.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjFlNzhmZTcyZTQ2ZGI4NGYxMjJmMmUxZWQ5MGUz">Katalin opened her eyes. Formerly purple, they were now a brilliant sapphire blue.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDExYTJiMjZjNzRiMTViY2IwNzMzMTE2N2E4Zjdk">“Careful,” Amelia whispered from behind them. “It’s powerful.”</p>
<p class="cnNkODllZDcxNmNhZTRiYmZhNzRjNTQ2YTdjODY2NzM1">Then, Katalin Spoke.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjk0ZTg1ZDdhYzQ5OTFhMTYxNGJjNWFkMjAzYTU4">It wasn’t <em>Bayle</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM2NmJkMmI1NzJjNzQ4YjNhY2Q4Y2Q2ZjBiZmQwOWFi">Nor was it <em>Narean</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNhOTE3MTg3YmU1NjRmYzk4OTIyZmQ0NmRiYWIyOWQ5">Nor was it <em>Longinus,</em> or any other martial Word Serena knew.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjUwMWVlNzJlZTQ0YTg5NzY4ODM1OWZjOTkwODVh">Nor was it <em>Kanaxai</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNkMWQzMWU5NTM5YjQyMDE5ZGE5NDMzNGZkNzQ0Njg0">“<strong><em>Alinyah</em></strong>,” Katalin Spoke.</p>
<p class="cnM0NWVmNjNkMWY0ZTQwZjc5OWM2ODM2NDhiMWVjNGNi">It was a Word Serena had never heard before.</p>
<p class="cnMyN2FmN2YxMzJjMjQwM2Y4OWY3MzA5NTE4YzkxMmU0">It was a new Word.</p>

<p class="cnNiZDI4MzZkNzBjNjQwMGE4MGRiMzgxNWU2MDMzMGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Amelia POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjQ3YzBiMjAzMzRiYzJhYThlMzI4NTY5YWE0ZWUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment Katalin Spoke</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Alinyah,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia felt her eyes widen. The room's atmosphere intensified — humming with anticipation at the inevitable fight. The defenders gripped their weapons tighter and dropped their centre of gravity.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzMxOGY0NTYxZTRiY2U4YzU1NDgyYjIzZmQwYTYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the…” Joey mumbled, his voice low under his </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> transformation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjY3ZDEyMjFmODQ3ODk5YjJiZTVjZjQ4MTUyYjc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia peeked around him. The other side of the room glowed in an ethereal, otherworldly colour. It wasn’t a friendly hue. Katalin glowed with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">violence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was both ominous like the bloodiest red and yet radiant like warm daylight or a clear sky. Amelia couldn’t describe the colour in any other way, for it was a new colour, beyond anything she’d ever seen in this world or her previous one.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjg3M2UxYTA0MjRlMjI5MDE5NWM3MWYzMjA2YWQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ochure,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the normally-invisible eighth colour of the rainbow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2YyZjU4YThkYjQwZjI5YzRmNGJlMmQ1MTdmZmQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia knew </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the game. She knew how the Word was supposed to work. It was how she knew what she was looking at, despite never seeing it before.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODE0YTY5MzA2MTRlZDU4NzNiOGM0NDViN2I4MjM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ochure was the colour of the characteristic glow of a Speaker of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjI1NzZiMTNhZDQzMzk5NjY2YzQyYzg1MmMwNWY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The God of Demonlight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTJiMmZiNzIyOTQyOWZhNWI0ZGZlNzg3YzdjMzZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a martial Word, and the ideal Word to use in this situation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2JlNGY1Yjg3MjQ2YWVhMWM2ZDI5ZWJhZDQ2NDI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s defenders seemed to understand the danger; while Joey stayed between her and Katalin, Ryosuke slowly approached his enemy with careful, deliberate steps. Amelia could see his breath misting from the coldness of his </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> frostbite form. On the other hand, Serena, with her magnificent horns crackling with hellfire, positioned herself carefully while her hot breath steamed from her nose.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjdjYzQ0YjA5ZDQzMjNiNzM3ZTMwNmMwNDljODQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before her mind could take her down a path of inappropriate thoughts, Amelia turned her attention to Nathaniel. The man had taken a spear from the wall and held it tightly as he approached Katalin’s flank. His horns and spear crackled with energy. With every step he and the others took, the tension in the room increased until it was almost unbearable.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDg5Yjk5MmJjZjQxZjJhZmFkMWYwNmI0NDFkYzYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She had to admit, she was a little surprised they hadn’t taken advantage of their numbers and exploited </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> weakness immediately! Although it made sense considering Serena and the other head instructors’ personalities. As noble warriors, they greatly respected Katalin and her skills so it was understandable they would want to see as much of her swordplay as possible. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGUzYTMyY2ZmMjRlOWJiNzJlNDIyZmJjMmZjZDVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, they might think not giving Katalin a fair shot would be disrespectful.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjRmYThiYjhjYTQ4ZGM4ZDdjZjZkNjVkNzc0Y2Mw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, it was only a friendly bout!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOWUxYjU5ZGIxYzQ0Y2I4Y2I3ODJhMDVmOWEyZTFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At some unspoken command, Ryosuke struck forwards, his sword slicing the air as its blue aura-enhanced blade swept down towards Katalin, who </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">glided</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> out of the way, parrying it lightly. As their blades touched, a melodic note rang throughout the training hall, coupled with a small explosion of demonlight that brightened the room for a fraction of a second.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWMyMGFjYmNlMTRlOGVhYzlkZjY2YzNmNGVmMDQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a surprisingly cautious attack for the usually confident Ryosuke. Amelia had seen him launch an all-out attack at Katalin when she instructed, so it was a little strange to see him seem… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hesitant</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Was he being wary because of the fact that they were all Speakers?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWE4NmFkZTAwYzQxMzdiNzdmMDNkMDM2NWMwYWQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia nodded to herself. That must be it! Serena told her that all training fights were like a conversation, where the exact amount of ferocity and power was slowly established with every exchange.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjhjMDJhY2I1MjQ2Mzk4ODcyZGI4MTZhN2FhODcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoksuke struck again with similar results. Katalin hovered over the sandy floor, her entire body moving suddenly as if she were weightless and caught by a blustery wind. It was as if she was ignoring the laws of physics! Katalin could impart more force in her parries than made sense from her floaty stance. Each time her blade struck Ryosuke’s, a pure note would sound, accompanied by a flash of demonlight.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWYyOTk0YTkzOTQ2YTRiZTFkYTZhMWU0Y2ZmODVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ryosuke?” Serena asked, her voice hesitant.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzRkYWVkZjdmMTQ4YjRhZGM5MTk2MWYxZWMxMmFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The light appears harmless,” he growled, taking a few careful steps back. “But her movement… is unnatural.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTU1MDNlYTdiNTRmNDI4YjMzYjIwNGE0ZDU1NzVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It may prioritise speed,” Nathaniel muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWZhZjc0YWJhYjRjNGE5YTBmMzYxNTNiYmU4ZWJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? What were they suggesting? Amelia frowned, but before she could say anything, Katalin raised her free hand elegantly to her mouth, letting out a small titter and saying, “I have no intention of slipping past in such a manner, even though I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">could</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Katalin’s eyes narrowed. “No, we’ll do this the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">real</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> way…” With that, Katalin pointed her sword to the ceiling before muttering, “...A proper </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">brawl</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Then her sword came down, and with it, her body flowed like the wind towards Ryosuke.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2JhNmNjMGY4NjQzNTBiNzIwMjIxZmVlMmEwNjQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She struck half a dozen times, each strike flowing harmoniously with the last, coming at Ryosuke from entirely different directions. In one moment, Katalin was hovering to his left, striking at his side, and then in the next moment she had spun around him, stabbing towards his neck. Alongside the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">elegant violence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was the symphony of melodic sounds, and every time Ryosuke countered, Katalin would be somewhere else, either avoiding the strike entirely or parrying it with a gentle touch and a flash of beautiful ochure.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Yzc4YzRhMWJkZTQ5Mzg4OWQxY2UwNTY2YzE5YTNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nathaniel joined in, his crackling spear darting forward, quickly synchronising with Ryosuke to create, in theory, inescapable situations for the Northerner. Yet, every time, the delicate flow of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> defied all odds. Katalin avoided each attack with the same </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">violent politeness</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> as before. It didn’t matter whether they came in from a blind spot, or with a sudden burst of speed as Ryosuke or Nathaniel flared their aura, it wasn’t enough to surprise the experienced Northerner.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2QzODI4ZGU4NjQ2Yzc5YzkwNGYxMDc0MWM3ZGZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When Katalin's blade struck Ryosuke’s, it made a high note. When it struck Nathaniel’s spear, it made a medium note. When the fight's tempo intensified, and Serena joined the fray, low notes began sounding as Serena’s blade was parried repeatedly. The result was a strange melody punctuated with eruptions of ochure. It was almost as if a magical fireworks display took place every time their blades collided.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTJiNzU1YWM2YTRiYjc4MTQzZTRlMmEzYTg2Mjhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Such skill…” Joey mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWIyYTJjMjcxYjRhNTM4NjliNmUyMTZiNmE3MDBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia couldn’t help but nod in agreement. Ryosuke, Nathaniel, and Serena were considered exceptional warriors with battle-hardened instincts. Without needing to discuss it, they would position themselves to defend their comrades’ weak sides, while striking out in the most opportune moments. Their strikes were natural and fluent, and the two swords and spear manifested a flurry of attack and defense that would, or should, butcher anyone unlucky enough to stand in their way.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTQ1YzdkOGVjYTRmNjM4MzkxNTg3NjIzNmRmNDc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, Katalin and her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> invocation didn’t care what </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">would</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">should</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> happen.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjMzZDFiM2ZlZDQ1OTk4ZDc4MjJjNmY1OWEzZmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She never let herself be swarmed by her three attackers, something Amelia understood to be the worst thing that could happen in the early stages of an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> invocation. Katalin wasn’t only defending. She was ferociously attacking them one after another. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWE2NzEzYjY0ODRhYzBiYjI0MTRkMmQzOTI5Nzdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin slashed at Serena in one moment, forcing her to focus on defense. Before Serena could recover, Katalin would be gone like the wind, darting towards Ryosuke to poke and prod at him only to float up several meters before gliding down to attack Nathaniel, slipping past his spear and forcing him to jump away.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjMxYTRmYmZhMzQxN2RhOTFhMmM1MGJiYTlmM2Iz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s hellfire sword.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGVlZDY4ZTY2YzQwYjQ4NGI0OWZmNDAyYzIwZTMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryosuke’s frostbite blade.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzNkMDcxOTIzNDRjNzg5ODJmNmFhN2JmODdhNjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nathaniel’s crackling spear.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjQ5N2Y1ZGYxYjQ1OTZiMTFmNzM3MzE4ZWEzM2M1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Each one wrapped in blue aura, capable of slicing or stabbing through the toughest battleship armour. Each one wielded by their hosts, enhanced with divine aether that propelled them into the upper echelons of society. Each one used with expertise that was unattainable to those without natural talent, against one of the most skilled swordswomen in the entire Empire.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2NmZjMzODVhYTRlY2Q5YzI4ZTc2YTM0OTlmZGU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But… Amelia couldn’t help but wonder. Were they really going to let Katalin continue generating demonlight? Amelia was sure the Northerner’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was close to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">blooming</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, after which the three attackers would be at a massive disadvantage. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDVkY2U4M2Y2ODQ1NDg4NGU0MmNiNTk4Mjc3MTc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, after all, was a Word that had to be defeated quickly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzVkMGQ4MWFmMTQ1ZjJhM2MxYWUxMTI0YWUwYWFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Because it was only weak at the start, before its Speaker gathered enough demonlight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzM5MWYzMzRlNjQ0ZjViZjE4NGM2Nzk5Nzk4ZGMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia always hesitated to assume how much of the game she played in the hospital translated to this world. After all, the game didn’t have floating continents, flying airships, a magical lumina, mysterious Formless or roaming animal gods! However, while there were a few differences, the mechanics of Speaking Words and the Words themselves seemed to more or less match. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzNmMDE2ZjE0NDQxMGY5N2EwZjg3ZTA1MzIzMDRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Judging from what she saw from Katalin, it seemed safe to assume </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> worked the same.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDkyYjczZWE1OTQwZmE5Mzc1ODQ1OTMwODhkMjhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Like in the game, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> required a focus on evasion and parrying at the start. It was a skillful balancing act that required the Speaker to engage in combat to gather demonlight while avoiding getting hit, for if they did, they would lose their accumulated light in a sometimes explosive manner. Katalin was doing this expertly, even attacking far more than Amelia had seen her guildmates do.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjdiMzUxMWExMDQzNzlhOWVhMjQ4ZTYwYzg5ZDY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, Katalin was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> skilled. She could afford to be more aggressive. Not only that… Amelia blinked her eyes, flicking her perception into the Shimmer once more. It was easy to do it with this much aether in the atmosphere. She only reverified what she saw earlier before awkwardly closing her connection to the Shimmer. It would be an uncomfortable conversation, but she’d have to talk with Katalin about it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDdjOGRhYzliYzQxN2E5NGQ3MTkwMzA1ZDg1ZDJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be okay, right?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWY2MWQyYmEzMzQyMDI5M2JlYzU5YjI4ZDg5MWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia shook her head and focused on the melody of the battle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2VjMTM3ZWU0ZDQ5MjI4YjFkODcwZGNjNGMzYmJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean’s Slowing!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Ryosuke invoked, a burst of divine aether rippling from him as he called upon </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to coat his blade in a shining white ice. He swung his blade at Katalin, and when she parried it, the ice </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">invaded</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Katalin’s blade.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjNmYzVmYmQyZDRiMmE5YWRkNTY0MGVhM2VlOWZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin didn’t seem to mind and continued to glow ever brighter as she fought her three attackers. Her peaceful expression was replaced with one of intense focus. Her formerly-pale cheeks were now reddened, and her forehead was slick with sweat. As the intensity of the fight escalated, she began flaring her blue aura, needing the extra power to counter the increasingly fast attacks as Ryosuke and the others became more determined to land a devastating blow. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWZmNzNlMGYwODQ2NmM5ZmIxMTU4YzUzNGY1N2M2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As their coordination increased, Katalin began using more than just her sword, gliding between her opponents’ bodies and tripping and throwing them at each other. As Speakers they could push against the aetherfield to prevent themselves from colliding with each other or the walls. However, it still served as an adequate distraction for Katalin to avoid a disadvantaged situation or put herself in an advantageous one.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWRjMTdhNDAwMzQ4M2VhZGIyNTEzODIzYTYyMzIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s not slowing,” Serena growled after trying to catch Katalin off-guard with a sneaky strike from her hellfire tail.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjQwNmVmOTM2YTQ5ZmY5NjQ3OTcxZmI5MDVmYmZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her observation was a daunting one. After parrying a dozen strikes by Ryosuke’s frostbitten sword, Katalin's sword and arm were covered in the shimmering white ice that was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">supposed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to slow down an opponent. Katalin, however, continued unaffected, as if the crackling ice freezing her was a mere decoration.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzQxZmUyZmY2YzRmMDY4OTVjNTVlNjM2YjIwZWFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, after blocking a fierce attack from Serena that produced a spectacular amount of demonlight, Katalin’s expression changed. She jumped back, creating distance between her opponents as a sly smile formed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGY1MTc0MjhkNTQxNjJiMzEwZDEzZmI3Yjc3ZmY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s been a while,” Katalin muttered, floating in the air.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzU5OGY4MGY0YTQ1MDc4MzI1MTM5Y2I5ZjU1ZmMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What now…?” Joey asked. He hadn’t yet gotten involved in the fighting, faithfully keeping to his role as Amelia’s last line of defense.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWZmM2Y4YTI0NzRiNmM4OTRmNzNlZmJkY2U3OTZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“C-careful!” Amelia shouted past him, sensing the twisting of the aetherfield around Katalin. “She’s about to bloom!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzJjOGQxYzc4MjRlZjI4ZGMzMjVmYjk0NDNkMmI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bloom?” Rysouke, Nathaniel, Serena, and Joey all questioned simultaneously.</span></p><span class="cjUyOWNhZTllMzg3NjQzNTRhODlmODNmZTUzMTQ0YTFi"><br/>This story originates from Royal Road.

<p class="cnNkNTgwM2IwMzQ2ZTRmNGM5MjUwZWJjZDRjMjUzZmZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh dear. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmJmMjFiZWVkYTRlNzI5NmMwNjIyZmNjZTM3OWY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This wasn’t good at all!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODhhN2QxMThiODQ4ZWZiYWJkMzJhNjhhMjg3MjM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">The trial ends, the offering accepted,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Katalin whispered, her quiet voice filling the room. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjFkM2I0MzlmNTQ0Zjc4NGFlMDdjNzllNzcwMGMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin's chest, where her heart would be if it was on her right side, began to shine brightly, with rays of starlight and vibrant ochure pushing through the cloth of her uniform. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">The heartlight forms</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Katalin continued, her breath misting with pure aether. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">The latent power blooms…” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">With a flash of demonlight and a single powerful note, wings of light </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">erupted </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">out of her back. Ethereal, semi-transparent robes formed around her body, creating a dozen thin layers of light that Amelia knew would be as strong as sixth-tier aura.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzk4YThkOWU0NjRkOTBiZmY5NWFlNzdjODc2MzMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the true power of the North</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Katalin's eyes met the Speakers’ below. The ochure demonlight wrapped her sword, extending its length and creating a shimmering surface that was both deadly and beautiful. Katalin opened her mouth, saying one more word that seemed more of a command than anything else.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2Y0Y2Y5NjA2ZjRiOWJhYzFiZmYzYmFhN2U0YmVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Despair</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzI4MGQ2MTdhODRiMDc5YmU1N2ZhYTQ4OTcwZTlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, everyone in the room swallowed. Amelia could practically hear her defenders’ jaws tighten and their hands squeezing their weapon’s handles. Amelia herself was transfixed on the beautiful sight of Katalin’s blooming form. The wings of light… the shimmering robes… her majestic sword… the words she said…</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjUwY2UwMjU1ZjRjZThhMjYwYTRmMThmMjA4NTBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia swallowed again. Katalin was…</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODg2ODA3YzcxYzRjNGFhY2ExYjJkNmUzYmJhMTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was…</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTEyMWM0ZGE4ZDRkOTk5YjhiMzI0MTBlMDUzNGZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">So cool!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTc5MDEwYmEwYzQ4M2JiMzExMDg4OWJmN2M5Yjdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">So unbelievably cool!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGZiMDNiYWUwNjQ0YTM5YjM5ZWY0NjU2ODM0NDll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Had she practised those lines!? Has she done that sequence in front of a mirror!? It was perfectly timed! A natural-born actress! She must’ve worked on the stage before, right!? How else could she send such shivers down Amelia’s spine! Amazing! The next time Amelia had the opportunity, she would do something </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">just </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">like that! It took every fibre of her being not to break out into applause!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGIxZjk0ODljNTRkYjc4MzVmOWFlOGRjZGExZDBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here she comes!” Ryosuke barked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTg5OWMxNmRmYjQyNTNhYzE2ZjEwYjc4ZDZhYjdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, she needed to focus! Katalin was the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">enemy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> right now!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmM0ZmJjYmY4NTQ3N2NhYmE5MDYyMTcwODNlZGJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin’s wings folded and she swooped down, her sword glowing brightly as it slammed into Ryosuke’s defense. Amelia heard the man grunt with exertion, and then in surprise as Katalin released an explosion of power and light from her sword, blasting Ryosuke away. The Northerner twisted, blocking Nathaniel's crackling spear with one wing while swinging her sword towards Serena, half a dozen metres away.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjYxN2NlOTk1NDRkZjU4NWVkNGNiZmUxYjY0Njk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">From Katalin’s sword a crescent of light shot out, carving through the floor on its way towards Serena who, seemingly judging she couldn’t avoid it, dropped to one knee, jamming her sword into the ground and putting her weight against her blade. Despite her preparations, the blade of light smashed into her like a runaway train, pushing Serena back a dozen metres and throwing up a mountain of dirt and sand before she finally stopped.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzdkMDMyYTlhYTQ2NjBhYzNlOTBlODU4ZWI1NTQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia sensed the attack shatter two of the wards she kept on Serena before her stronger ones, coupled with Serena’s weakening blue aura, held the attack off. It took several seconds for the attack of light to stop trying to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">burrow</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> through Amelia’s wards and eventually fizzle out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjE2YjQzMGE3NTQzM2I5Y2NjM2RlOWIyNDM4NmQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fucking hell,” Joey mumbled. “What kind of Word is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmI5NjE0NzkyMTRkNDhhMTQ5YzgzYjM0ZGM0ZjM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia silently agreed. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> really was overpowered once it bloomed, wasn’t it? It possessed defense on par with a weak Second-Word, while having the ability to produce overwhelming attacks in close-quarters and at range. While it spent demonlight to manifest its abilities, it could recover that light through continued combat!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzUyM2FjY2IyMDQ4Y2I4ZTM4Yjc5MTY0ZWFlMGQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was why you always had to defeat an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speaker quickly before they could bloom! If you fail to defeat them in the first phase, you’ll be on the backfoot and struggling to survive once they bloom!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODc4MWUzNzQ0ZDQwMmM4NjMzNDQ0ZjFmNDNjNWI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia sighed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWJhZmE4M2JjODRjMTc4YmY4MjJhMGUzYjQxMDgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She supposed it was her time to shine. She figured she shouldn’t shout out the mechanics, it would be too difficult to explain </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">why</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she knew what she knew. She’d already revealed too much by using the term </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bloom</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Per her previous agreement with Katalin, she wouldn’t use </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> magic to attack or heal, unless someone was seriously injured. It was a massive limitation, especially as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> wards weren’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> exceptional. Still, she could even the battlefield before Katalin utterly overwhelmed everyone else.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmIxMGQ1Mzc5YzQ1YWJhMGZiYTQ0NzEyZjJjYTQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wards going up!” Amelia declared, spooling her aether. Her magic squealed in delight as it was invoked, her spells rushing across the room to wrap everyone in a golden light. Their recipients took a moment to adjust to the sensation before resuming their renewed attack against Katalin. With the power the Northerner had displayed, they seemed to understand their only hope was a battle of attrition.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjk5YTQyMTM3MjQ1MjNiNTdjYTEzY2MwYmQyOWNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And a battle of attrition it became.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjM0MWUxZGMzNjQxYjA5OTQ0Y2I0ZWJmOWUxOTQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">One minute.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWRlZDM1MDM4ZTQ4ZGM5ZWE2OTE5MjA0NmYzOTFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Five minutes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjY4NDc4MDAwNjRhNWY5YzkwZWU5MWVmNDUzZTM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ten minutes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzgyMTNiNzcxYzQ2ZWFiNzNmN2U0ZmZmYWM3NDE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Through gasps of breath and with sweat coating the sandy floor, they fought. On a few occasions, Katalin found some breathing room and launched a crescent of light at Amelia, only to be blocked by the titanic Joey with his hardened aura. Something about his </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> invocation meant he wasn’t thrown across the room when he withstood Katalin’s attacks.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWQyMmI2ZDY4YjQ0MDc4NDdlOGM5NzM0ZWU5ZGI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Fifteen minutes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjE0YmIwMmU3NTQ2YTJhMDlhNWZiNTRiY2E5OTc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was becoming clear the three didn’t have enough power to break through Katalin’s shimmering robes and aura, and that Katalin didn’t have enough power to break through Amelia’s wards. They were all trying to be conservative with their aura, only flaring it at the moment they made contact with their blades. Even so, the repeated actions were tiring the three of them out, and Katalin, who had to manipulate her aura far more than her opponents, was showing a weary expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTZmMzljMDg5NTQxNDdhZDcyNDcyOTk3ZWMzZjUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Twenty minutes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDZlYzk1MTA2YjQ3YTI4NmU3YTc2YjY4NjQ3YzJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The light of Katalin’s sword changed to a brilliant blue, which she then swung at the empty space between Nathaniel and Amelia. As the blade swept through, Amelia felt a terrible tearing sensation with her aether. Nathaniel's golden glow subsided and Amelia felt a weird sense of loss. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGJlNTRjNGU0ODQyYTc4ODZiZDMzZmU4Y2IwMTcz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A quick examination of the aetherfield confirmed her suspicions.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGUxMzk5MGMxZjQ1MjVhZjNmOWNjNjczNTYxMGEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, Katalin had cut the aetherflow, causing Amelia’s ward to collapse.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWRkMjczODdiYjQ3MjM4YWFiOTNhODE3Y2FlODRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia desperately formed a new one, but Katalin was faster, getting under Nathaniel's spear and blasting him with a burst of demonlight, shattering his blue aura and throwing him back. He collapsed against the wall, his eyes closing as he fell into unconsciousness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTMyMmRlNTJjZDQ1MTJiNDRhNWRjYzI2YmQwZjY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One down,” Katalin mused, diving into the air to avoid a joint attack by Serena and Ryosuke.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGI4ODJmYTg3ODQ0MDZiM2FhMTNlMjJlMjBjMWEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She…” Amelia found her words. “She cut off my wards somehow! Be careful!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODlkMTViNWJkYjRmMDA4NWIzZGE3MGRiMGQxMDY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her warning was heeded quickly. Serena and Ryosuke retreated towards Amelia and Joey. It was risky to bring the fighting so close to Amelia, but it meant there was less space for Katalin to repeat what she had done.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGIzOGY2ZmViNjQ2YjlhMDEyZjhkYmIwNGRmOWRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, she managed it a few more times, but with Joey so close, he could interfere and prevent Katalin from shattering anyone else’s aura. Feeling Serena’s wards collapse worried Amelia, but then she realised Katalin was only cutting the aetherflow in this world, not the aetherflow in the Shimmer - through which Amelia kept Serena’s most powerful wards running.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjM4OGY1ZmFhZTQ2YjA5NDg0YmU2NWQ3ZmE2NTdj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Twenty-five minutes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjNlYzlhODAxNDQ1NTRhMjdjMjg3OWM2ZGQ4ZDE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Joey could not make up for Nathaniel's offensive skill, and Katalin found more and more opportunities to slam a devastating strike against his shield. Each time her attack connected, a deep and sonorous sound rang out, like a massive belltower producing a single, determined note. Each time, large quantities of dirt and sand were thrown up, covering everyone in the room and sticking to their sweaty skin. Amelia could even feel the grit between her teeth.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGU0YjIyYzA4NDRkMGVhNTQ3MmY1ZGI2ZjQ2ZDdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They couldn't push Katalin back with Joey’s lack of offensive abilities, but with his defensive skills, they could stop her from getting to Amelia or putting anyone else out of the fight. Katalin was breathing heavy now, and her shimmering robes had lost some light. The glowing heartlight emitting from underneath her clothes had noticeably dimmed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmY2YWNiY2UxMDQ5ZDVhY2RjZDFmNGIwYWE5ZjQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thirty minutes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODY4YWQwMTc4MTQ2Y2Q4OTc0ZTExOTY0ZmYzMjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin once again cut the aetherflow feeding Ryosuke’s ward. Ryosuke jumped back, ready to let Joey defend while Amelia re-established the connection. Only this time, Katalin didn’t chase. Instead, she slammed her sword into the ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzlmYTEzOTY3ODQ4M2RhNWJmZTFiZDRkN2VlMzBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah’s Devastation,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” she said quickly, twisting the sword as the aetherfield contorted wildly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmRmY2VkYzEwMTQwOGQ5ODAzMWQzODhhMDA0MGUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The room went dark. Katalin’s light momentarily dimmed, then, the ground exploded with rays of ochure light erupting from underneath their feet, throwing them all into the air and shattering Ryosuke’s aura before Amelia could ward him again. It was a blinding area-of-effect attack, with power more in-line with a mage Word than a martial Word.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjJhYjgxNzVkODQ5MjdiMWFhMWYxNDg2MDYxMWJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They had been taken by surprise. Joey frantically positioned himself the best he could, with Serena on his flank. Using her foot, Katalin flicked Ryosuke across the room to land next to the unconscious Nathaniel.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTUzYWJiNmZhZjRiMGJiNzRkZDI5ODNjMmI5MzMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Two,” Katalin intoned. “Now, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ack!” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">She coughed, droplets of blood falling to the sand. “Ah…” she said, wiping her mouth. “I’ll need to finish this quick.” She flashed a smile, not the smile of a friendly instructor, but one of a predator. Although her condition was bad, her light was dim, and her mouth bloody, Serena and Joey were not much better.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzQ4MGM5NTE1MzQ5MzJiYmRmNThhM2IzYzFiMTkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena was struggling to keep her aura stable. If it weren’t for Amelia’s wards, she would have likely collapsed by now. Serena had the least experience compared to her seasoned colleagues, and it showed with her aura flickering down to green.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGUxNTJkZmJjMjQzMTI5ZGMxMzAwOTg0ZWEyZmNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t…” Katalin pointed her sword at them, gasping for air. “Want to step aside?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmY2MzgwODU0YzQzNjU4YmY1NGIwNGQ1ZTdjMjdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am the bulwark,” Joey said between deep breaths. “I shall not falter!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjk1NTA3NWNkYzQyM2ViYzZlNjZmNjMxMDdjODg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re half-dead,” Katalin replied. “I will win. I know this. You do not have the endurance.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmVkZTkwYzI3ZjRkNjhiMWQ4Y2RjNGIxOWM3YTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Strange,” Serena said with a laugh, gripping her sword with both hands. “I would say the same thing to you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjIyNTE4NGI5MjRhNTM5ZGMwZjJkYmEzZTUxNjE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They eyed each other for a few seconds and then, as if in silent agreement, resumed the battle with renewed vigour. Both sides fought in increasing desperation, using dirty tricks to do everything they could to exhaust their opponent before they collapsed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWMyNzg0NGY2MjRiYmM5ZTk2NzJmOTg1ZDkzNjU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thirty-five minutes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTA2ZGQ5Njg2ZDQ0YTZiOTBkNzc0NWI4N2NlMmMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At this point, their fighting more resembled a drunken brawl than a dignified exchange between seasoned veterans. Serena lost her sword, but then abused Amelia’s powerful wards and leapt at Katalin, grabbing her sword arm while tanking a direct hit. She began to wrestle with her to try and take her sword, pulling them both to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDk2YjJmNGRiNDQ4NmU5ODg4MGY0YWQwMjI1NTFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin used her wings to fend off Joey while trying to punch the back of Serena’s head.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDJmODMxZmJhZjQ5NTU4YTJlNjc1YzNlZGFiNGYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena used her hellfire tail to slap Katalin in the face repeatedly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2RhNWIzY2M5ZTRiY2I5MTFjMTBjOWQ3YmFjYTBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin gave up punching and began throwing sand in Serena’s face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzU1MzA5YTJlMTRjYzM5MDNjMTEyMWNkZDg0ZWQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena began biting Katalin’s wrist with closed eyes, like a wolf gnawing its leg to escape from a trap.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzg3NGJlMWQyNDRjMmM4ZmNhMjcyMTk0NDgxZDU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia chuckled nervously. Serena once told her every martial duel was a conversation. If that was true, what was being discussed like… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTBmODExMDJiZTRhOGViY2RmNzRkOTZiMGFkMmJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">By this point, Nathaniel and Ryosuke had woken up. After understanding they’d been defeated, they kept to the sideline, and when Serena and Katalin began tussling on the ground, they began whooping and hollering.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDE2Nzc3MzYwNTQxMWNhNjVhNDNhODlkMTI5MWUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took almost no encouragement before Amelia joined them, pumping her fist in the air and giving her girlfriend some much needed moral support.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2JlNGQ1OWMwMzQyNWZiM2M0Yjg3Y2FjMzNmM2Fj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go on! Bite her!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzY5NzY0YWI3YjQyNDI4M2FmYzg5MjViMjZiMzI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s grabbing sand!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2VlNzc0Nzg1MTQ4MDE5ZjMzYTAyNzA5OTU2Yjc0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kick her… you know where!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTE1ZTJhMzQyZDQ0NDc5OGM5MDVkZTY3ZWM1MGJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena managed to clamber onto Katalin’s back, and was in the process of rubbing the Northerner’s face in the sand and dirt, assisted by Joey who was holding her wings down, when the door to the training hall opened.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2ZiYmE1MjExMzQ2YmJiNGQwNmI4YWU0OTdhMDQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When Amelia saw Grandmaster Shun step through and close the door behind him, she swallowed nervously.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGJmZjhiOTkyNzQ2NDE4NGJhZjk5YTY3MGU3YTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When Nathaniel and Ryosuke saw him, the colour drained from their faces, and they immediately stopped jeering. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjIxM2U0OWEzYTQ0Y2Y5OGRhZWZhZTNkMTRkNzU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When Joey saw him, he clambered off Katalin’s wings and scrambled away.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmMxMDNmOGQxNzQwYTBhZTU2ODlmMWU4NDMyZjYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The grandmaster was halfway across the room before Katalin and Serena noticed his presence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjZiMTBhODhmMDQ1ZjViNWIwZDBmNDI3ZDk2ZjM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They froze at the sight. Katalin's fist was jammed in Serena's mouth and Serena’s hand gripped Katalin's hair, pulling her head back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGEyOThhNWYzMDRmNTFhNzg2ZGM0NzFhMDM1ZTM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a dozen seconds the grandmaster said nothing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTJlMDgyODA1NTQ5ODM5OTI4ZWQxNTg0NTY0OGUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he sighed. He approached the wall and picked up a heavy wooden training sword.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjRlMzFjY2M3YTQwNTliZmQ0MmZjYTMzMTQ1OGM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You kids…” he muttered, shaking his head. “When you’re as old as me, you sometimes forget how immature the younger generations are.” The grandmaster approached the women, his aura flashing into orange and then yellow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDBmNDUyYTJmZjRjODE5YjE4ZDQ2ZDA0NGZlMjMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“G-Grandmaster!” Serena stuttered, removing Katalin’s fist and climbing to her feet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDdlNzRiYzI3MjRiZGZiZTE2YTI0YjNjYjQxZTZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahem,” Katalin coughed politely, trying to straighten her clothes. Even her ethereal robes were loose, and her wings of light, barely visible, drooped as if in submission.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGM2ZTAyNjQxZDRkNjE5MjAyMGIxMzAyZTI2MWI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” he said, pointing the sword at Serena. He then slowly aimed it at Amelia. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” he continued.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjNjYWQ3NjkwMDQ1MWI5ODc5OTJkNTI4M2Q5Nzk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes…?” Amelia mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzMwOTI2YjFjMTQ1MDk4ZTNmNjc4NzgyNDhkNzJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And…” The grandmaster pointed the training sword at Katalin. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, yes? I did not expect to find such a rare and powerful Word Spoken in these halls.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzQ3ZTVhYjU4ODRkM2ZiNjAyNmE4ZjZiNDY4Yzcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How… do you know about </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” Katalin asked in confusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDJhOTliNzBmNTQ2NTQ5YjMzZWVjNDhkMjQ3YWRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha… haha…” The grandmaster chuckled, rubbing his chin. “I’ll be the one asking the questions. But first…” His eyes narrowed. “It is the job of the senior generation to discipline the junior one… prepare yourself, children.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTFmMjNlZjBmMzRhYWY5MWMxOTljNDFlM2ExZjU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait a second,” Serena said, raising her hands.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzZiZjQ1ZDFiNjRmYzE5MjRhMWExOWRlM2IwMzUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no need-” Katalin began.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmZmYTc2MjE5ZDQ4YmViZjA1MzA0YzIwYzZiNTQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><strong><em>Taruna</em></strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Spoke the grandmaster. His eyes flashed dangerously before he leapt towards the three women, yelling out a battle-cry.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWZmYTQ1MzQ2ZTRjMDhiZDJmODM0YmU4NWEwYzc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The events that followed became legend in the Asamaywa Officer Academy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTlmMTYzYjgwYzRhOWM5NDU1MmM3MzhmNGI3YmZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What exactly happened and who was involved was never fully confirmed. Some even doubted it occurred in the first place. Either way, those suspected of being in Speaker Training Room B at that time would deny anything unusual took place.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTA2ZjUxNGEyYjRiNjI5OTFjMTQ3NTRlZTNkMmU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the future, the only thing that would come to Amelia’s mind when she remembered the event was that…</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTg2ZjdkYmJmOTRjNmJhNmU0MjNiOGFiMjRkZDg4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Some grandpas could be awfully scary sometimes!</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Seventy-Nine: Canonisation</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM5OTEyNDViMDA4NTRlZmJiY2NjZmY3NjhiNDcyMGY3"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMzZWQ2Y2MxNzQ5MTRmZDk4MDNjYWY2M2I2NDhlMWQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the next few days, Serena's schedule was relentless. On top of everything she already had to devote her time to, she was under pressure to make the final selections for the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> new squad. She coordinated closely with Aiden and each time they saw each other he had yet another stack of papers detailing the students’ and their families’ backgrounds and connections. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmJjNWY2NmZmMTQ4N2Q4ZDJhNjEwOTZlNjRiNjQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t just a matter of each prospective warrior or mage passing a personality profile; it was also about verifying that they had no hidden debts, obligations, or criminal activity that could be used as a vector of subterfuge in the future. Beyond that, there was a singular factor that Serena was ordered to consider above all others.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODNjMTI3ZDU1OTQyMDg5N2M0MTc2NjUyMTViYzBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Could they be friends with Amelia?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWE2MDc2Y2IzZDRmNzI4ODdhZDY4MDMxY2FkYTlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While Serena had to prioritise this question, she also had to devote enough time to studying for the upcoming commodore examination, all while ensuring the preparations for the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> were going smoothly. Given their destination of the Southern Terra Firma, she and her officers had a whole new set of problems to handle; the ship’s medical officer, Hillbrand, was coordinating the supply and storage of several hundred vials of vaccines they would be administering to the crew after they left. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjNlYzRkYTdiYjQ5Mjk4OTYyMTI4Yjk1ODRlOTY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Desert Fever was no joke and they couldn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">assume</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amelia would be around to heal them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDQwMDY0YzdkZDQwNzk4NmZkMGY3MWRhMzE4MjBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her chief engineer, Allston, and gunnery officer, Thorne, were also busy ensuring the propellers and gun turrets were sufficiently protected should the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> find itself in the middle of a lumina-born sandstorm. There was also the question of finding appropriate dust covers for the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> parasite fighters attached to its hull, and whether the attachment points for the lightcraft needed to be upgraded to withstand the dangers of a sand-laden barrage.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjE4NjA1NWIzODRhMDU4Y2YyMzg2NjQ3YTIyMTFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, her officers' competence meant she could offload just enough responsibilities to not burn out from stress. She would probably be sleeping with her horns in her hands if not for Amelia’s regular healing and night-time stress-reducing activities.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODM0NmY0MWQ3NDQyZTQ5ZmM1MzE5MzA2ODMzNGNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, Serena managed to tackle the days as they came. The end-of-year tournament was approaching and formal lectures had ended to allow the students some time to focus on their preparations. The academy grounds were full of construction workers erecting the temporary seating surrounding the outside arena for the upcoming duels. Activity was also blossoming in the city streets where decorations were being strung up alongside buildings in preparation for Christmas.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWQ4ODBmYjM2OTQ0MGU5YjQ0MDA2YTBmZGI5Yjlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, the religious holiday fell on a day when they’d be sailing through the Southern Passage. For that reason, Serena had instructed her cooking staff to bring some choice cuts of meats and extra spices for the day. While the demonic branch of Christianity wasn’t the most popular religion in the East, any captain worth their horns would know the crew would expect </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">something</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> special on Christmas.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjM3NzExZjM1ZDQyZTg5MjY5ZjdmY2RhN2RlY2I2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And Serena was a captain worth her horns.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmE4YmVkZmI0MDQyYjE4OGEyMDc2YzVlNWRiNmI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, before Christmas, before they would set sail, and before the tournament, the day had finally come for House Halen’s family dinner. That was due to take place in a few hours. But… before that…</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzFlM2MzZDM4NTQzODA4NjVjZmM5MzA3MTI0OGMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I look weird…” came Amelia’s voice from beyond the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmQxOGI5OWMwMjQzOTE5YWNiYzg5YzdlNDI1NWZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t say that, Lady Thornheart!” one of the maids chastised.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODUxMWUyNGQ3NjQ0NWU5YjkzMmUzNmYyNjEzMjdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look stunning!” another one added. “I’d never thought a human could look so radiant!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGJhOTUyOWM1YzQ3OWRhNDllZTBjZmU3ODVkZjJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the day of Amelia’s canonisation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTY3YzEwNTgyMTQwYWE4M2M1ZWNiMTVjYTU4MmUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">While the future saint was being dressed in layers of religious garb, Serena paced the stone floor of the Asamaywa basilica. For some reason, even though she wasn’t the one going through the ceremony, Serena felt nervous. With its tall archways and detailed stained-glass windows, the building invoked a sense of wonder that made you want to keep your voice low. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzhmZjI3MmNkNTQwNzhiN2QwMTQ3ODU4NzljNTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It also didn’t help that while the cardinal kept his promise of keeping the ceremony discreet, that didn’t stop all three greatlords of the Three Sisters from turning up! Nor did it prevent those greatlords from bringing several dozen highlords with them! The atmosphere in the basilica’s reception hall had been stifling and Serena was glad to have the excuse of escorting Amelia to escape!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDlkMzQ3NDNiZjQ3ZWVhYTNlMTk5MTA0N2ZlYmUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Finished? Finally!” came Amelia’s cheerful voice. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjk1OGY2ZDg4MzQ1MDhhNTlhOTE1YWVhOTA2OGM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few steps sounded, coupled with the rustling of heavy cloth. The door creaked open and Amelia stepped through. Serena blinked, looking at her girlfriend for several seconds before saying, “Well, you certainly look the part.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjNhOTZjOWEwMDQ2ZjZhZWVkMmY3YzEzNmE3NWI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia's robes were white, made from layers of heavy cloth. They screamed purity and the yellow-crystal thread that formed ornate patterns throughout the clothing whispered of wealth. Hanging from Amelia’s neck, a wooden demonic cross settled just above a depiction of the symbol of the Empire - a golden crown wreathed with two silver horns. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDQyODVhMzcxNzRkZTVhNDU2MmUxODUwODA1YmVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With no horns to paint white, the maids had woven white ribbons through Amelia's golden hair. Serena had to admit that, with Amelia’s golden hair contrasted by the white decorations and her white robes contrasted by the yellow-crystal thread, it came together to create a pleasing sight.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmE4NzdjNTM2OTQzZWU5MzZiNzdhYzM4NGYxNDRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">so many</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> layers,” Amelia intoned, rolling her eyes. She picked at her robes, only stopping when one of the maids' nostrils flared with a sharp intake of breath. Amelia mumbled an apology, casting Serena a weary smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzQwNDc4Yzg4OTQyMGRiZjdlNjE4MGEyYzc2ZWRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">These maids evidently took enormous pride in their work. It wasn’t surprising; the opportunity to personally </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">dress a</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">saint</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was a once-in-a-lifetime event. Devoted church maids wouldn’t let something small like a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> get in the way of that!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWNhZTcxZmQzMjQ4ODA4OTM0YTg5M2I3MzViZGY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent, excellent!” an aged voice cried out. Serena turned to see Cardinal Hiroshi striding towards them with a spring in his step. “This is a historic moment!” The cardinal lifted his cross, kissing it lightly before looking to the ceiling. “We are truly blessed! Christ, the Empress, the Moons… are all surely smiling right now! Now…” He reached down, delicately taking Amelia’s hands. “Have you memorised the words?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmRjYjVlNWFiNTRkMDdhYzAwODAwY2QzMWQ3NTYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded. “Don’t worry! I’ll do my part!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTIwZDkxNzkzNDQyOGRiYjUwMmViNmQyMjE0OWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena didn’t miss the mischievous glint in Amelia’s eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzk0MTdiOTlkYTRiMDc5NjY3NzdmNDY5OWNmMGYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good,” Cardinal Hiroshi said before turning to Serena. “The Holy Register of Witnesses has arrived. Your fellow witnesses are waiting in the aisles along with everyone else. Could you go ahead, Lord Halen? We’ll be through shortly to begin.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTU4MjJhMjg2YjRkMWM4YTA2MDEwMTRiZWE3MjZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Cardinal,” Serena intoned, bowing politely. She gave Amelia some final words of encouragement before heading down the corridor and through a door into the basilica’s main hall.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjNiY2UxMzhiODQzYTViYWQzYTg1MjJiNTUzMTA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When she entered, dozens of pairs of eyes snapped in her direction. Greatlords, highlords and numerous church representatives eyed her before returning to their murmured conversations. Greatlord Oshiro was in quiet discussion with the greatlords of Asamino and Asamoto. Surrounding them were a dozen highlords, some of whom Serena recognised from times when they would arrive as guests at House Halen’s estate. Her father was there, giving her a nod across the aisle before returning to his conversation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjRmYjc4NDFiMjRmOTJiN2I5NzE2ZDhkZmIyZDBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Between the aisles lay a thick red carpet leading from the entrance of the building to the altar at the far end. A lectern stood in front, overshadowed by a statue of Christ in his familiar pose: bleeding, broken, and offering his snapped horns to his spiritual successor, the Empress of Cascadia. The statues were simple and carved from wood. Yet, they somehow invoked a sense of gravitas that dominated even the presence of the three attending greatlords.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2NlZWM0NjYzNDQ0Yzk5ODNlN2E1OTFjZDNjYjBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking upon Christ, Serena felt… complicated. Years ago, she turned away from Sangoism because she no longer felt spiritually fulfilled by its predominantly martial teachings. While it had been a reliable source of strength during her earlier years, Serena sought a different presence in her life after the Federation convoy incident — something that wasn’t so focused on </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fighting</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTEzOWZlODk5MDQ2N2RhNTJlZjBjMzEzMmZlN2Ji" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Becoming a member of the Demon Church had been the obvious choice. The Demonic Testament offered what she needed: Hope, clarity, and most importantly of all, passages that relieved her guilt. In the Demonic Bible she’d found the writings of the Empress resonate with her. Sangoism taught how to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fight</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> conflicts, but the Demonic Testament taught how to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">end</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> them. Perhaps if it weren’t for the teachings of the Bible, and the heavy inclusion of humans within its text, Serena wouldn’t have been so accepting of Amelia so quickly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGUwMGIxZDNlMDQ0ZWE5OGE2OTc0YTY4MTc2MzI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she didn’t like to be seen doing it, she occasionally clenched her hands and performed a quick prayer before bed. It was nothing much, just a quick ‘thank you’ delivered hastily to Christ and the Empress.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDhmOWU3Nzk2MzQ2OTY5NDVhYzdmZWIwYWJiMTUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanking them for sending her Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjY1MmNjMjZlZDQzZjg4MWE1MTVlYjgyNTNhNGFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the irony didn’t escape her that the Demon Church labelled her and Amelia’s relationship a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Then again, Serena’s life was full of compromises. You never held all the cards in a war - you could always identify things that would give you an even more advantageous position: a different elevation, a better firing solution, more munitions or better-trained soldiers. Sometimes you just have to make a decision and stick with it. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzBiNzQ4Y2FkYzQxYTc4OTFhNjI4ZDFkYjYyZTE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was exactly what she’d done when she’d decided to open her heart to Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2VjOTY3NTE1ZDQwNWU5ZGVhZjA3ZjY0ZGM3OGU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As if celebrating the end of her self-reflection, the basilica’s aetherlights dimmed. The lack of artificial moonlight meant the natural daylight streaming through the stained-glass windows created a colourful and warm atmosphere. The whispered conversations stopped and everyone’s attention was drawn to the far end of the hall, where Cardinal Hiroshi was slowly leading Amelia down the red carpet.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTU5YzAxYjAwYzQ5Nzg5Yzc3ODdiYTQ4MGJkNTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The old man looked like he was tearing up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmIyZDkyN2VlODRmYTVhYTIyNDI1MDBkNWU2YjVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And Amelia…</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDRjNzUxNjA1YzQ4OTk4YWRmODU1NTk1OWE4NmEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was a mixture of Amelia’s radiant hair and robes which stood out against the dim room, or maybe it was the fact that even the greatlords were transfixed upon her, but she had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">presence</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Her expertly-cloaked wards would tickle the instincts of the dozens of Speakers in the room, while her looks would draw the eye of both men </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">women. She was a terrifying power that rivalled the skills of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">at least</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a greatlord, all packaged up into a bundle of chaotic and cheerful blond energy that most Cascadian lords didn’t know how to handle.</span></p><span class="cjFiNDBkODQyNGM5ZjRjNjA4MzYzMjQ3ZjY1MzlkYzg0"><br/>If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMxMWZiN2JlZjM3MzRhNWJiNTViNzUyM2ExYjhhM2Qy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena felt like an unspoken conclusion was instantaneously made in the room. Any lords that had been harbouring doubts about Amelia’s canonisation would quickly have reevaluated their position upon seeing her magnificence here today.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmQ0NzA3NjFlZDQ2OTA4YTcxZDdhYjQ1MWM2NzA0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As she passed by Serena, Amelia turned her head slightly, giving Serena a quick wink. Some of the demons standing nearby murmured at the unsaintlike behaviour.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTU0NWM4NGZmZTRmMDhhNTZhMTU2OTM0NTg0NDFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Get used to it</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought, trying to keep a serious expression on her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWMzMjYyOGM0MDQ5MGViODY0ZGUxZjhhOTQ1ZTQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cardinal Hiroshi began the ceremony. He moved behind the lectern and, with Amelia by his side, he started recounting her story: a tragic life being born in Karligard, only to spend years on the run, hiding from the Human Church hunting her down to hoard her healing powers for themselves. The attendees were told how Amelia eventually found a ship to take her to Centralis where she became a refugee and devoted herself to learning High Imperial while Intelligence hid her. Eventually, coordinating with the authorities, she’d set out to see more of the Empire, all while selflessly healing those she encountered. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzVlNDg2MGY2ZDQwNDhiNzNhY2UwZjFlNzA3Nzhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Amelia chose the distinguished East as her first destination,” the cardinal droned on. “She was captivated by the unique cultures of the Manwese, Samino, and Ainese people. Her first visit was the plateau city of Kenhoro, where she fell in love with the swordsmanship of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Shimokan</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. This appreciation of the Eastern martial art led her to attend the Asamaywa Academy, where…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDJhMmE5MTcyNjQwZjlhMjc3OThiOGNlMTQxNDM5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena tried not to frown. She wasn’t sure how much the man </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">actually </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">knew. As a cardinal, he was the Demon Church’s equivalent of a greatlord. Yet, from her conversation with Greatlord Oshiro, it appeared that even they were not told of Amelia’s realm-travelling origins. Furthermore, while her Lord Superior had deduced that secret, he’d given no indication that he knew about her soul transfer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzVlZTQwZmM3NTRmMGJiZjk3MGMyOWZmZmJiMDJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if Cardinal Hiroshi did know the truth, he could hardly introduce her as, ‘This is Amelia Thornheart. She appeared in the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> captain’s quarters half naked and then proceeded to shamelessly flirt with said captain until-”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmJkNjQwNzllYjQ3YzhhNDg5MTk0MWQzYWI0NWJj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena gave herself a mental slap. What was she doing, allowing her mind to go down such an inappropriate line of thought!? In a holy place nevertheless! Serena kept her mind clear and focused on the ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGE5MTUxZTRhZTQxNTFiNzg3ZDBjMWI0MGFmYWRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After Cardinal Hiroshi had finished recounting Amelia’s imaginary life in this realm, he listed the reasons the cardinals had unanimously voted for her canonisation, emphasising Amelia’s role as an unwavering symbol of peace and unity as well as her exceptional assistance during the Asamaywa fire.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzFlNmU2MWViZTRkZjBiZmQzNDFhNjZhYzM3ZTIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">He concluded that Amelia’s name would be entered in the canon of the saints, and her work should be venerated and serve as an inspiration to all of demonkind. Glancing around, Serena saw many of the Lords nodding along, some even politely wiping tears from their eyes. She had to appreciate the cardinal's talent at public speaking, even if the story was false.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDFkNGYyYzNkZDRjYzE4MzJjYzcxYWU1YmQ2OWRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wasn’t it a sin for a clergy member to tell lies on holy ground?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjc2MTU5Y2E0NjQ1NDY4NmIyNWYxZGZmODg4NWVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The petitions have been answered,” Cardinal Hiroshi declared, dramatically holding up a document. “The Head of the Demon Church, the Empress of Demonkind, has affirmed that Amelia Thornheart’s canonisation is for the honor of the Church, the exaltation of the faith, and the defense of demonkind against the darkness!” He flourished the paper, upon which Serena saw the neat </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">‘E’</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> signed at the bottom. It was strange how even just seeing the Empress’s recent </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">handwriting</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> made Serena feel a sense of awe.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGIwMzNiNWM4MjRmNjViNGM5YTE5MWQ0ZGIzMWU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before the Empress, under an irrevocable decree, declares and defines Blessed Thornheart to be a saint, we must, under the light of the five moons of the Empire, hear the vows and promises!” The cardinal turned towards Amelia, instructing her to repeat after him. “I, Amelia Thornheart, vow to faithfully promote the cause of justice and peace, and to encourage the spread of love, life, and happiness to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">all demonkind</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzY2Mzk0OGUwMTRmMGNhNDdmOTBjNTE3YzdhZTll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena saw Amelia swallow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDhmZWYzZGQ2YjQwM2I5MDc2Y2IxMTcyNTAyY2Uy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, Amelia Thornheart,” Amelia began. “Vow to faithfully promote the cause of justice and peace.” Amelia’s eyes flickered to Serena’s for a moment. “And to encourage the spread of love, life, and happiness to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">all</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzZmMzFhMjUzZDQ4YTk5YjQzYTIwMDhmZGRhZDhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s lips curled into a smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2FmNjBiZWRhODQzZWJhZjMxNDUzYjNkNjAyYWI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, that was why she had the mischievous twinkle in her eyes earlier.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTQyYTc4Yjk4ODQ1NzFiMDFjZTFmNjUyNTdiMmU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Whispers and murmurs sounded from the aisles. Amelia’s choice to change ‘all demonkind’ to just ‘all’ did not go amiss amongst the attendees. Cardinal Hiroshi blinked three times before opening and closing his mouth. He turned his head, his eyes darting across the room. Serena followed the cardinal's gaze as he stared at the one man Serena couldn’t sense at all.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGRiZTBjNWQxNzQ5MTZiODE1Y2JiM2VmYTRlYjdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">When had Chesterfield appeared?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzg5MjdjMzcwODQ5OWU5ZjU2OTczNWI3MWIwNDM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The neat-looking Intelligence figure looked back, not at the cardinal but Amelia. Amelia wore an easy smile and then </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">winked</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> at Chesterfield. It was a wink that said, ‘You’re not going to trap me that easily!’</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2I5NTFmMDQxOTQxNzU5NzY4MzNkYTAyNjgxZmY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">An almost imperceptible sigh escaped Chesterfield’s lips followed by a quick nod towards the cardinal, who swallowed and resumed the vows. It took him a while to return to his confident and dramatic candor, but they were soon done. Amelia had consistently protested, constantly changing ‘all demonkind’ to ‘all’ and even once adding ‘and humans’ to one vow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGQ5OWM5NDJjNjQ1NDU5YzdlNmU3MGQ3ZDY5MGI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the shaky end, the ceremony neared its completion. Serena, along with the other designated witnesses, were called to the front to sign their names in the Holy Register. To her surprise, Chesterfield was one of them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmRlY2M5NmUxZDRkN2FhMDM1NTg5ZmE4OGRlNTli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you been forced, coerced or otherwise manipulated through unnatural means to undertake this ceremony?” he asked Amelia, who shook her head and denied it. “Wonderful…” Chesterfield mumbled before using the provided quill to scratch his name into the book.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDFkZjJkZGUzOTQ2MjM5NzgxMjYyZTM1N2Y3NGRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena had heard rumours that the quill was actually a magical artifact, taken from the wings of one of the titanlords that ruled over the Centralis Basin during The Long Discordancy. It was a nice story, but Serena’s perception told her there wasn’t anything unusual about this particular writing instrument. But then again, her perception struggled to pierce whatever defenses Chesterfield had, and he </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">certainly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> wasn’t ordinary.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTQyZDNkNjBkZDQ4YjhiODY0ZDM1N2JkMWU1MzQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once it was her turn, Serena stepped up. She asked Amelia the same question and received the same answer. Nodding approvingly, Serena bent down to write her name.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDg5NjM2Yzk1OTRjMTdhMjU5OWM5NzRlY2NhNjI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTJiMDYyOGQ2ODRkN2Q4Yzk2NmY4NTJkYjFkNmFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Athelstan Chesterfield</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODA5OTEyMWFjNTRmODE4M2FmZTc5MjAyODFjNzM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an unusual name, and strangely familiar. Still, to think this would be where she would discover Chesterfield’s full name. That is, of course, if he had signed his </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">real </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">name. She wouldn’t put it past the crafty Intelligence officer to sign a pseudonym.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjA4ZDRjYjFjMjQ1MzVhYjY2MjVmYTRjOTYyMTE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Problem?” Cardinal Hiroshi asked gently.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjVkMjY4ZDllZDRiYzBiOTFlODc3YzRhNmRjYTIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, sorry,” Serena mumbled and quickly wrote down her name. Following her, there were a few more witnesses. Several high-ranking-looking Church members, followed by Greatlord Oshiro and his peers; the greatlords of Asamoto and Asamino. They each ensured Amelia wasn’t under duress before signing their names. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWYxNzhmNGZlMTQ5YThhMDBkYWZiZmYxNjNiYTg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena wondered exactly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">why</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> they needed to clarify that the saint was consenting to the ceremony. Wouldn’t that be something that was naturally </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">assumed</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? Was there a historical event that caused this tradition to start? She made a mental note to find out after her busy schedule had died down. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmM1ZTE0NTlmZTRlOTliMjhlNTA5YWM4YWU1MjNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ceremony finished with Cardinal Hiroshi's final speech announcing Amelia’s formal canonisation as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Saint Amelia</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. The cardinal then led Amelia down the red carpet. As Amelia passed by Serena, she twirled elegantly, allowing her robes and hair to flare upwards. The action caused a few to gasp in surprise - not at any breach of etiquette, but because of how eye-catching the movement was. Despite the occasional tumble or unwarranted destruction of venison, Amelia was remarkably dexterous in her actions. Serena thought Amelia could quickly become an Empire-renowned dancer should she choose to be.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODRlMTVjOGI3YzQ3ZTE5MzFjNjE1ODQ4ODQ2ZTJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Those in the aisles began to filter out, following Amelia and the cardinal to the reception hall. As they walked, Serena found herself next to her father. He looked happy and Serena understood why; not only was House Halen closely associated with a human </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaker</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, but that very same human had now become a rare </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">living saint</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Amelia wasn’t formally a part of House Halen, but the association was more than enough to elevate the House’s prestige.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmJkYzQ4Mjg0YjQyMGJhNWRkZGI3ZTNiZWJiZDNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">On one horn, a noble house that did direct business with humans was seen as a sign of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">losing </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">prestige. Demon nobility were supposed to keep with their kind, and if their economic goals required contracts between their house and a human company, then it would be done through a merchant third-party. A house directly using their name to establish connections with a human organisation was a sign of a desperate house that had fallen out of favour with their demon peers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTdjNjI1OGU5MjQyNmM5MmE1MDY4OTJlZGU3YTE0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other horn, the presence of Amelia meant more and more noble houses </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">wanted</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to form connections with House Halen. With the upcoming public announcement of Amelia’s canonisation, her father and mother would likely be bombarded with letters and requests. Thankfully, Serena and Amelia would be a thousand klicks away by then, sailing west through the Southern Passage towards Ishaq.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTk1ZmIyZGE4MjQxMTc4ODIxMWIzY2M4Mjk0Y2I3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The reception further demonstrated this point. While Serena, her father, and Amelia were in polite conversation with the greatlords of the Three Sisters, Serena could see more than a few demons wanting to approach both the new saint and Serena’s father. If it weren’t for the presence of Greatlord Oshiro, who stayed with them even after the greatlords of Asamoto and Asamino left, they would have been swarmed!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Yzk5OGNjMmNiYzRlZDM4OGE3NDg3YWRiNWYxY2Y3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She suspected Greatlord Oshiro was intentionally keeping them at bay. He tactfully called over the highlords one at a time, making small talk while introducing them to Amelia. They would always bow politely and leave with a light-hearted invitation or a quick prayer, but otherwise didn’t push too hard.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGNiOWRmMzg4ZDQwMTI5ODc5NDRjOGQ3OTVmNDY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone was on their best behaviour and things went smoothly. The minutes ticked by until the bell towers sounded, announcing the time.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzQ3OTYxYmMwZDRiNmE5YjQ4ZTlhYjc0MjlkMDMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is our cue,” Serena’s father said as the ringing ended. “We have a dinner to attend. Our carriage will be waiting… Greatlord Oshiro, are you…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTg0YzJjZGJjMTRkNWVhOWM3YmQ2MzY3OGZjZDk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” the greatlord replied. “I have other obligations.” He leaned in. “The Sabanis Dominance is holding talks to negotiate the Republic’s surrender. I’ll be travelling there as part of the Cascadian Delegation to represent the interests of the East.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzZkMzI5MzQyMTQ4YWI4NzYzNGRkNmUyMWYzZDE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… so it’s going to end, then?” Serena’s father asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjhlMjE3NGVhNDRiMTY5OWE4NDZhZDUxMGJlN2Yx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Greatlord Oshiro nodded. “It’ll end.” He leaned back. “I can’t make time for your dinner, but I believe my wife accepted the invitation.” He turned towards Amelia, saying, “I understand you’ll be attending?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2QwYTUxZjIwYjRkNWZiZjg4YjYxYWI0MjA2NWJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjE5ZTVkM2Q5ZTQxNjU4M2QwYzhlNGFlZDJhM2Y0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ashina’s been excited to meet you again. She’s only refrained from formally inviting you to our estate due to how busy you’ve been with the fire and your other obligations. Next time you’re in the East, we’ll be sure to host you properly.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjQ1NzEzNzJiZDQ0NjBiNmJlMWI5YzFhMDkyMjUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t wait!” Amelia replied with a thumbs up. She turned towards Serena. “I’ll go get ready! I can’t have a meal dressed like this!” She gestured towards her fine saint robes, scrunching up her nose. “Feels a bit too much, doesn’t it? I’ll go change and meet you in the carriage!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGFkYjU0YWRlOTQ5NDU5YmVlYmQzZTNhZjQwZjli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Amelia bounced across the room and told one of the church maids it was time for her to change. She disappeared and reappeared a few minutes later in casual clothing. Serena didn’t miss Cardinal Hiroshi’s look of disappointment at the change, but he didn’t say anything other than wishing them well. After a final round of goodbyes, they took their leave and exited the basilica into House Halen’s waiting carriage.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjA0ZGQyMmFjZTRlM2I5ZGYzNGIwMTgzNDE0YmJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This will be our last meal together until you return,” her father said when the carriage started to move. “It’s a shame Nina isn’t here, she’s been eager to find time to come home but her work keeps pulling her away.” He shook his head. “I hope Lani behaves in front of Ashina. Don’t mention the ceremony to her, by the way. Lani would tell half the city before sundown! Also, I hope Grandmother behaves…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGRjNjZjMzNmYzQ4NTZhMDViZmRjY2JiYmU2ZjVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As her father muttered his concerns, Serena sat back, relaxing as the carriage carried them home. She would try to make the most of the dinner. Within a week, they would set sail, and who knew when they would return? They could be gone for a month or even a year! Lani was growing up so fast that Serena felt guilty she wasn’t there to see more of it!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODEwMmE2MTk3ZjRjZmQ5MTExYTBhZWExY2M0OTRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lani… Grandmother… Mother…</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena thought, glancing at Amelia. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">And Lia…</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM5MmY1ZGJiM2IwMTRiNzg5NTMwZjhkN2ZmOWFkZGE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Four people with strong personalities. They would all behave in front of the wife of a greatlord, wouldn’t they?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODI3ODFmMTliYjRmMmU4MTgzODFiOWQ1MDBhMWU5" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right?</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNkY2JiNjlkMjViMTQ0YzliYzE2NjBlNzU3M2Q0YzQz" style="margin-bottom: 2em"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img alt="New Scene - Serena POV" height="60" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/serena.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/><br/>As their carriage trundled through the aetherlit streets towards House Halen’s estate, Serena decided to give Amelia some much-deserved praise.<br/><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You handled that well,” she said as a conversation starter. <br/><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a blessing that her canonisation had gone so smoothly. Amelia was, after all, a trouble magnet. Any significant event involving her had a fifty-fifty chance to either go to plan or have Amelia’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">amelianess </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">cause a storm of horn-clutching chaos.<br/><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!” Amelia replied with a wild grin. “Are you kidding? I was so conscious of my feet when I was walking down that carpet! I kept thinking of what happened during the award ceremony!” Amelia buried her face in her hands, letting out a rather unladylike groan. “If I don’t think about it, everyone will eventually forget, right!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Njk0ZTY2MzIxYjRiNDNiNDc3ZDgyMTVhMmQwZjlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course,” Serena’s father affirmed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjI4ODQwMWI3MDRlYjk5NGRiMmZlMDk0ZjhhMWEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Not a chance,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjUyZjNkYjc3MjQxY2FhMTg1OGMyMjY2MTg3MmNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Serena speaks the truth,” her father continued. “You handled it extremely well. Of all the witnesses to your canonisation, I imagine many of them had all kinds of expectations of a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">living saint</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I don’t think it’s outrageous to say that you exceeded those expectations, Amelia.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGRiMGU2ZDBkZjQ4M2RiN2E3ZjI4YThiMDlhYTBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?” Amelia peeked out from behind her hands.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzM0MjY3MWQ5MTRkYjdiMWMwYTkxYzliMjU1M2Uw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” he said with a serious nod. “The moment you appeared, it was like a spell was cast upon the room! No one could take their eyes off you! I fear the Church will regret the choice not to take photographs. They’ll want you to appear in that uniform again.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGEyNWJhMzA3ZDRhNzg4ZTk1NzljNjlhYmM0YTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh,” Amelia said, scratching her neck. “Maybe… If they pay me enough!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmQzNjI5MzczNjQyOTk5MjhhM2U1OTFmOTMyZDBj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At Amelia’s words, Serena’s father awkwardly coughed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDBlNzgzNmZlNTQwMWE5ZDA2MGQyNDYyZjdmOGRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena laughed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWIzNWIxYTkzNzRlMDQ4ZTM5YjJlNTk5M2ViNWE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope the Church is prepared,” Serena said, flashing Amelia a playful grin. “I doubt they fully understand the bundle of chaos they’ve brought into their fold!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDlkYjE0Y2U5ZTRlZDU5NjhmMjc4NTJjZThjMzMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey!” Amelia protested, puffing out her cheeks. “From my point of view, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you’re</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> the one who's always nearby when things go tits up! Ah…” Amelia covered her mouth, casting a glance towards Serena’s father. “That wasn’t very saint-like, was it? Oh!” She pointed at the window. “We’re here already!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTk4M2IwM2M0YjRiMGQ4ZGE4MWY2MWE3ZGVkMWFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite Amelia’s naked attempt at changing the subject, her observation was spot on. The carriage passed through the estate’s gatehouse and, within seconds, was parked in front of House Halen’s estate. Serena heard the crunching of boots walking over gravel before the carriage door was opened by her father’s butler, Johan. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2EwN2ZmYzZkNjRkNGRhNjhlNWQ1NzllMTFiMGY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena peered out past his shoulder. Behind the butler stood a familiar grumpy face. Serena’s grandmother. She was gripping her walking stick with shivering hands and looked rather unhappy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzNmZTcxN2UyZDQyM2VhOGM2NjRjMzdlZjc1Y2Rj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hurry up!” she barked. “How much longer will you force me to stay out in this blasted cold!” The walking stick was jabbed into the floor several times in annoyance. “Hurry up! Let me see my favourite granddaughter!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjQ1ZGRmMjcxMDQ3Nzc4MTVjZmM2NThhZTNkYTM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grandmother!” Serena exclaimed. “Thank you, Johan,” she said quietly, taking the reliable old butler's hand as she climbed down. Serena approached the elderly demon and said, “Don’t let Lani hear you call me your favourite. She’ll throw a tantrum!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzY2YjM0NWVjZDQxN2NhMjM4ODVmZGZhMjM1M2Fm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bah!” The old demon scoffed. “She wouldn’t dare, not in front of me or her mother! It’s because of young Dalinar over there!” She raised her walking stick, jabbing it toward Serena’s father. “If he didn’t spoil her so much, she wouldn’t be so immature!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2NiNTc0ZTQwYTQ5YmRhMjExMmY2YjgxY2VmZjE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, Sachiko,” Serena’s father intoned, stepping down from the carriage. He took off his overcoat and wrapped the cold, complaining demon in it. He turned towards Johan. “I’m guessing she insisted on coming out here?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDAyZGQwNmU0NjQ1NWI4MDVhNmFiYjFlODMxZTkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Highlord,” Johan said politely. “I warned her about the weather, but she still refused to take a coat. She claimed…” Johan frowned slightly. “That she survived much harsher winters before.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjQ3OWI3M2ZhYTRmNThhNDM4MTAwMTNkNzBmZDRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s father sighed. “Sachiko, you must be more careful. You’re not young any more! You need to look after your body and save your strength!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2M1YjY1MWI3ODQ1YTk5MDQ5MzQyYmRiNmJiZTU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha!” Serena’s grandmother laughed. “If you weren’t a Highlord, I’d show you how much strength this old body and its walking stick have!” She turned towards Serena, clicking her tongue. “Look how improper he is - calling a woman like me </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">old!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Tsk! Anyway, dear…” She placed a wrinkled hand on Serena’s shoulder. “Congratulations on your Golden Horn. Despite young Dalinar’s best efforts, you and Nina continue to bring prestige and honour to this house!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjJlOGQ4OTEyNTRjNzBhZmIzN2UwMWJiMzlmZTll" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Grandmother,” Serena said, glancing at her father, who was rolling his eyes. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTVjYWIwMTIzYTQ4NWFiZGI0YzMyN2UxZWIxODQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Grandmother had never fully approved of House Halen’s activities in the war. Sachiko Halen came from a generation where producing munitions was considered a lesser vocation, whereas farming and academics were held in high regard. Of course, after decades of steam-powered and ship-assisted Wilderness clearing, the East now produced more food than it consumed, selling the excess to Centralis. This immense food production meant farming was often thrown in as a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lowland</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> vocation and not given the appreciation it had previously held for centuries.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWMyZGM2NTM3ZTQ3M2E5MmUwOTIxOTIxNzQyNzIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wasn’t the only recipient,” Serena began, looking back. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjFlMTUyMDEwYzQzNjNhNDFhMjQ0NWJlOTM5OGVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">As if on cue, Amelia appeared. “Hello, Grandma!” Amelia chirped. “How have you been!?” She gave Serena’s grandmother a deep bow before adding, “You shouldn’t have come out when it’s so cold!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTRhOThmMmI3YTRkNDI4OTFkNDg0YTQ1OWUxYjVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“G-grandma?” Both Serena’s father and grandmother stuttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODgzNjkxOWYyYTRiZDc5Y2ZjZWY0ZWViNjU4MWQ2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amelia also received a Golden Horn, Grandmother,” Serena continued as if nothing had happened. At this point, she had moderate resistance against Amelia’s outbursts of… Amelia. “I wouldn’t have been able to save so many people without her spellwork.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzUyMzU4YmM4ZDQ4ZWJhN2U1NjQ4ZTI4MTliMGU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahem!” Serena’s grandmother cleared her throat. “Well, of course! I would expect those you associate with to be exceptional, even if they are only human! Besides…” Her eyes narrowed slightly as she examined Amelia. “I said she’d do, didn’t I? Although I wish you could have brought a nice man home instead!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTBiNjNhZTQ0NTQ0MjA4NDQwNzJlNzU4ODFmMzYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grandmother!” Serena complained.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTM5MjExMWM5NDRhZWM5NTJhYmM5NGU0N2MxZTQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sachiko…” her father mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjUwNzNjNTMwMDRkYWQ5OTkzY2RjZTkzYWE5MTU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!?” the old demon exclaimed, raising her hand to her ear. “I can’t hear you if you mumble!” She tapped the floor with her walking stick. “I stand by what I said! I want to hold some great-grandchildren before I die! I want to see some softhorns running around the house! See some snotty noses and hear some blubbering cries! I’m not staying alive just to spite you, am I!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWI5YjU5NGY4NzQ1MmRhMDg3Zjg1NmY4ODNiNzEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could have fooled me…” her father said quietly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDdkOWJjMDY2YzRlNTdiYjc4OGU5ZTkwMGI4Yjc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard that!” her grandmother protested, waving the walking stick. “I’m not deaf! Besides…” She lowered her impromptu weapon and turned her attention back towards Serena. “If you or Nina don’t have children, then Lani will beat you to it! And I just know she’ll spoil </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">softhorns every bit as much as your father spoiled </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2QwYWVhMWUwNzQ1ZDZhN2E5MjM0Mzc1YjYwZTUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“May the moons fall upon me and put me out of my misery…” Serena’s father muttered, his face suddenly showing an expression of resignation. Serena couldn’t help but smile at their bickering. Despite first appearances, she knew her grandmother’s horns were still as sharp as ever. Sachiko Halen was one of the few people who could put Serena’s mother in her place.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmYxYWY3MjAzNTQyY2ViY2NkNmYxYmJkN2U2MjU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greatlady Oshiro is with Highlady Halen and Young Lady Lani in the eastern reception room,” Johan said before Serena’s grandmother could retort. “I fear keeping them waiting any longer may be inappropriate, Highlord.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDY2NGI1ZWY2NzRmNTQ5YWQ3NDBkMzBjNjlkNGVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Johan. Thank you.” Serena’s father sniffed, adjusted his uniform, and then led everyone into the house and through the brightly-lit hallways. The house was unnaturally warm. When Serena questioned it, her father explained, “We had underfloor heating put in while you were away.” He pointed to the floor. “Copper coils run under the floor, with an aether switch and red moon crystal every metre. They’re connected to these rotary switches here.” He pointed at the wall where a crystal switch sat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGVkNzI5MTA2YTRiNTM4NzBkZjAwOTg1ZTI3NWQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impressive,” Serena admitted. Now that she knew where to look, she could perceive the aetherflow running underneath their feet. “Expensive?” she asked. Red crystal had been going at a premium for years, and acquiring it for purposes not related to the war effort carried a heavy cost.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjAwZTJiMWM4NDQ0OTNhMmUyY2Y1ZTAwOWM0Y2E5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not with our contracts,” Serena’s father replied, looking over his shoulder. “Right, best behaviour. Let’s give a good impression to Greatlady Oshiro.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDdkZDdiMDkxZjQ5YmY5NzQ1ODViZDk4NjEzNDk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They entered the reception room. Serena saw her mother entertaining Greatlord Oshiro’s wife, Ashina Oshiro, along with Lani who was doing her best not to look bored. Half a dozen of House Halen’s employees formed a ring around the room, ready to step in with refreshments at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGQ1OGJlOTUxYTQ5ODY4MTU0NTE2NWJiMzA5NjI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dalinar!” Ashina called out, her refined voice carrying a melodic quality that was pleasing to listen to. “Michiko was just telling me how much time you’ve been spending down in Shimashina! A good husband must make time for their wife!” Ashina turned towards Serena’s mother, saying, “Honestly, I’m half-tempted to storm into Vikram’s office and tell him to give Takahiro some time off! Every week, he has to travel somewhere new!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGNlY2FiNDlhZjQ5NDZhMzBlYmNhMWE0YjYyZDIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a pleasure to host you, Greatlady Oshiro,” her father said with a bow. “I’m sure every minute away from you brings pain to Greatlord Oshiro’s heart. He was only recently complaining about having to take another trip, so I’m confident he shares your frustration.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDE0MWJmZjg5MTQ2MmE4MTg4ODYzMDNjNTcwNzQ4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look!” Ashina said, waving her hand playfully. “Look how the men protect each other! What are we poor wives to do, Michiko!?” Before Serena’s mother could answer, Ashina turned her attention towards Amelia and asked, “Don’t you think women are more trustworthy, Amelia? Come sit here, dear.” She patted the couch next to her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzFjODc1Y2M5OTQ1NjA5NjBhMjI4NDYzYWY0OGE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay!” Amelia nodded. She curtsied politely before making her way over to the couch. “Hello everyone!” Amelia exclaimed, giving Lani a small wave as she sat down. “It’s nice to meet-” Amelia was interrupted by something. Serena saw her eyes widen and her pupils dilate. Serena followed her girlfriend's gaze to see what had caused Amelia to look at something in a similar manner to how she looked at Serena.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGYwMjhhM2NhNDRkZWY4ZTM1YWJkOTlhZjQ1MmRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, of course.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmVhZDFkODkyYjRmOTU4Mjk5MjA3NWMxOTZjZDU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Poro</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!” Lani explained, seemingly happy to contribute. “He’s an Ainese Shorthair! He costs over three hundred denarii, but he doesn’t like playing with me!” Lani pouted. “He scratched me once, so be careful!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmEyNDI0Yzc1NzQxY2RhYmQyYWMzOTkzZmJiNGVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s so…” Amelia’s eyes flashed dangerously. “Cute! Poro! Come here! Psst psst!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTMwNmFlOWI1ZjRmNDg4MjUxN2I1ODcyY2YzYmU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena resisted the urge to roll her eyes. She sat down opposite Amelia, saying, “He has a temper. Perhaps now isn’t the best time…” she trailed off, hoping Amelia would understand that playing with the house </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">peeka</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> could wait until Amelia wasn’t sitting next to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlady Oshiro</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTYyOGQxOWQ0MTQ3MTZhMzZlZTFhZjgxNWM5NzUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nonsense!” Amelia exclaimed. “Poro!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjExMzM0ZTc0ZDQzNGJiMmJmN2FmNGJiZWIyYTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Poro lifted his head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmUzZTUwY2VhYzQ2YzZhN2UyYzgwMjkwNzRmMDJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meow?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGY3ZTM5YTA1MjQyMTZhOTk3MTYwZjUyNWJiMjM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on!” Amelia clicked her fingers.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjk3NjJkODI4YTQ1N2Q4ODYyZDY1Njc3NTBhODY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">To Serena’s shock, Poro, the grumpy peeka that never let anyone stroke him without exchanging a few bites and scratches, jumped down from where he was curled up, bounced across the floor, and, after only a moment of hesitation, jumped up into Amelia’s lap! Then he began to purr as loud as a lift engine before kneading his front feet in circles and rubbing his neck against Amelia’s hands.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGNhOTk3MzZlMzQyYjI4M2UyMDFlMmI0NDBhMmM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He likes me!” Amelia said happily.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDU2MzgzZGQ4YTRlN2ViYmVhNzQ5OTczNWYyY2Qy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow…” Lani mumbled.</span></p><span class="cjYxNWFkZDM0ZDE1YjQwODZiOTNkZGI5OTk3MTgwYTVh"><br/>If you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM0MThiODc0NTg2ZjQyZTc5YjJmZGM5OTFkNDIxODYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena wasn’t as vocal but shared her little sister’s surprise. Poro the peeka, or as Lani sometimes called him, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Poro The Terrible</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, had never shown as much affection as he was doing right now!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDZjZmJiZTAwZTRkMWViZmMyMDYyODlhN2Q0YjM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly… did Amelia have to make friends with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">everything</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> she came across?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTk0YzJlNjFiYTRiMmE4ZjZmNzBlMmY0YmZmODM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re an animal lover?” Ashina asked, her voice devoid of any annoyance at Amelia’s impoliteness. The greatlady raised a hand towards Poro, quickly withdrawing it when he tried to swipe her. “It seems only you have a talent for the felines, Amelia,” Ashina said, pouting slightly at her rejection.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWJlMjJjODkyMDRhM2Q4NDllNmZmYmQxNzZlMzU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Poro! Behave!” Amelia chastised the peeka, who eventually settled down after having his ears scratched. The peeka curled up, burrowing its nose between its two tails, and fell asleep while still purring loudly. “Sorry,” Amelia said sheepishly. “I love cats-” Amelia coughed quickly. “I mean, I love peekas. Serena won’t let me take one on the ship!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTg3M2MzNDJlMjRmODQ5OTJlMGE4MTk5ZDZlMWU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?” Ashina said with a gentle smile before turning her attention to Serena. “Why not? I would have thought the presence of a peeka might do wonders for ship morale?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTJmYzk5ZDNiYTQwNjY5NDg2OGQ0MjljMzZkZGUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I fear it would be too distracting, Greatlady,” Serena explained carefully, glancing at Poro. She decided not to mention that the other reason was selfish. While they were sailing, she and Amelia had separate hammocks, and if she couldn’t sleep with Amelia, then she sure as hell wasn’t going to let a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">peeka</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> replace her!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2NiY2UyMDc0OTRlNzBiZjY0NzM5MDM4YWIwM2Rj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They make good rat-catchers,” Amelia said, grinning while giving Poro scritches.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmYxYWE0NWQzZTQ5MWQ5NDAzMjE2ODkxNzA5ZWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are no </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">rats</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> on my ship,” Serena countered. She’d heard stories about waterborne ships having problems with vermin. They climbed the ropes while the watership was tethered to the dock. Luckily, regular ships like the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> didn’t have that problem. Imperial docks were too well guarded to let any rats slip up the gangway.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTk4ZGEwNmIyYjQ1NjFhYzQxMzRmMzg3NTQ3NzRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, anyway,” Ashina declared. She clapped her hands. “Sachiko! Come and sit down and have some mint tea! I was worried about you being out there in the cold!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjNhNjkzZGRjOTQ2ZTk4NDUxYTRjNjIxMmNlNWFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s grandmother grumbled something that sounded like appreciation before sitting down in a soft chair. An attendant brought over a cup of steaming tea, which Serena’s grandmother greedily snatched. After huffing and puffing about it being too hot, she eventually stopped complaining.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmMxNWIzZTE4YjRmMWZiZWY5Zjk5NmI3ZWM1OWIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I must offer my congratulations,” Ashina said. “For the Golden Horns that you were both awarded. So many lives were saved because of you two! It was a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">dreadful</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> fire, was it not? You could feel the heat of it from our estate! Ash covered our lawn! I can’t imagine what it was like in the centre of that inferno!” Ashina tilted her head. “On behalf of the city and its people, thank you. The Blue Moon must have blessed us to have you both staying here when the fire broke out.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2NiNzE5ZjM4ZTRlZWViMDI5MWExZTZlODU5MmYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a problem!” Amelia replied happily.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWFiZjUxZDYxZjRlYThhNDg3OTRmZThiZmQ4MmM1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena bowed her head before saying, “We were only a small part of a much larger effort.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjAxNTNlZTRlMzRiMmM5MGRiMTAzZWUzM2JiNjU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course,” Ashina waved a hand. “But credit must be given where it is due, don’t you think? Besides, everyone’s contribution falls flat compared to that mysterious </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speaker, doesn’t it!?” Ashina leaned forward. “Have you seen the photographs? What an ethereal and beautiful embodiment! Did you notice its feminine figure? Doesn’t that mean the one who invoked the lost water god was a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">woman</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDFmYzJhZGU2MDRhNTU4NDM2ZTE5NzRhMTM3MWE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena was looking at Ashina, but out of her peripheral vision she saw Amelia’s hand freeze momentarily before continuing to stroke Poro’s neck. The greatlady seemed not to have noticed. Serena quickly said, “It was a truly magnificent sight. I heard rumours that the Overlord himself made the decision to reveal the communion in order to save the station.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNThkMjRlOTRhNDQ3MmRhMmFjZjg5NDZmZDlhNjY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, you only know rumours? I was hoping you or Amelia might know who it was,” Ashina said, her voice tinged with disappointment. “I was told you were both near the location of the embodiment, so I thought you might have seen </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">something</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzA2MWM2ZmI4MTQxM2ViNmUwZjkxM2QwY2Y0OWEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A wall of thick smoke surrounded us, Greatlady,” Serena said, trying to keep her voice even. “We could barely see in front of our own noses.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTE0NzM2ZjEyMTQ2MTg5Nzg5YjNjNmM5NzRmODQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so,” Ashina said, a teasing smile appearing on her face. “It must have required someone capable of cycling a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">tremendous</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> amount of aether, wouldn’t it?” She raised a delicate finger to her chin as if in thought. “There aren’t many people known for their large aether capacity. Isn’t there a…” She frowned momentarily before continuing, “A </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Inoue</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> at the academy? Wasn’t she famous for her talents in cycling large amounts of aether?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTFhMDRkMGU1YTQ3M2RiMTgyZGNhZGE0MTg4Zjky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can’t have been her, Ashina,” Serena’s mother interjected. “Lunaria Inoue was seen all night helping with the earthworks to protect the lifts. Unless it was an illusion, it must have been someone else.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTEyMjI1NWI3MjQzMzZiZTlmZDE2YWE2OGQ0NGZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, is that so…” Ashina smiled, turning towards Amelia. “What do you think, Amelia? You’re a talented Speaker. I’ve been told you invoked </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taranis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a while ago. He’s an elusive Word now, considering how much </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">aether</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is needed to commune with him. Do you have any idea about the identity of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speaker? I would have hoped your perception would have identified them, given how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">close </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">you must have been!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGMwNTcxYzk5YjRmYjE4NGY2ZDUxMmRiNTQ0ZGE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s fishing,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena thought. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She suspects it was Amelia but isn’t sure</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWRjZDdlZmU4ZTQ1ZThhOTA2NjI2MDQyOTU2NjQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena knew Greatlord Oshiro was not the type of man to spill Empire secrets to his wife, but she also knew Ashina Oshiro didn’t become his wife for any lack of shrewdness. Greatlord Oshiro and everyone else in the square had signed vows of secrecy regarding the matter. No matter how much Ashina Oshiro pushed, they couldn’t tell her anything.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2QyNDFiNDc3MjRkYzg4N2YyZTgxYjcwMjI1NDlk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which was something Serena suspected the greatlady had thought of.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDA2OWE2ZDZkODRjNzY4NWMzZWI5NWRiM2I3NmE2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe,” Amelia smiled awkwardly. She raised a finger and rubbed her cheek. “I wouldn’t know. I’ve only been in the East a short while and haven’t yet memorised all the significant mages. I was preoccupied with healing, you see? It must have been a powerful </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">demon,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> though. Don’t you think? Are we sure it wasn’t the Overlord himself? I’ve heard he wasn’t seen during the fire.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDZhYjgyNDYwMjRiMjU4YmFhOTBhMGZiMzVjNzg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ashina sighed. “Sadly, Vikram was photographed in Centralis at the time.” The greatlady sipped her tea before dejectedly saying, “I suppose not all mysteries have to be answered. Although…” Her eyes shone with sudden enthusiasm. “You must tell me about Katalin of Driss! She’s refused all my invitations! I was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> close to storming into the academy myself and dragging her out! You’ve been training with her, isn’t that right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmFjNTA2OGU1YzQ3MDY4Yzk5Y2EyNTI5NzZiOWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Greatlady,” Serena replied, glad of the subject change. “Highlord Driss has been teaching biweekly sessions for the academy’s instructors. Her swordsmanship is as elegant and refined as the stories say. No…” Serena paused, thinking about the time when Katalin taught them how to fight outnumbered, where the Northerner skillfully outwitted an entire class of senior warriors, all trying to swarm her. “She’s even more impressive than the stories.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTRjODY4MmJhODQ5MTBiNjhmODk5MzJjYWY4MmNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a memory flashed in her mind. In it, she avoided getting sand rubbed in her eyes by a dirty, sweaty, and snarling Katalin. Meanwhile, Serena did her best to slap the Northerner into submission with her hellfire tail.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Mzg1ZmI5ZGRhNTQzNWU4NGE4ZTRlYjkzYmIxOTAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena gave herself a mental slap. If she didn’t think about it then it didn’t happen, right?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjFjYjEyZDdkODRjNTQ5MWNkZmY1OGEzZDJjYTE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my!” Ashina put her tea down, leaning forward with excitement. “And what about her looks? Is she as beautiful as the Northern Lords claim? Is her hair the colour of fire and her eyes a shining emerald green that no man or woman can refuse?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODAzZWYyZjBmYzRjNGE5NzM1ZDhiNTYxMTQ5ZmQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena smiled at the naked eagerness of the greatlady. “Her hair might not reach the colour of fire, but she nevertheless carries a sharp and refined beauty that would satisfy any man. Although, I fear the poetics of her potential suitors may have led you astray. Katalin’s eyes are purple, not green.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzI5MWM1ZGM3OTRhMjQ5OWJmNTljY2ZmNTQ3YTE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm,” Ashina hummed. “I’m certain I heard about her green eyes from Greatlord Driss himself. You would think a man would know what his own daughter looks like, wouldn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzhiZDhmNzUwYTQ5MGViOTFmMzJmMDQ4MDRlMDk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps she is using a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaxai</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> glamour, Greatlady,” Serena said. It was a plausible explanation, but Serena knew it wasn’t true. Even under the heightened perception of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Narean,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena hadn’t detected anything unusual regarding Katalin’s appearance. Still, she didn’t want to argue with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ashina Oshiro</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> over such a minor detail. “Or perhaps, like Amelia, her eye colour is the result of her magic?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2FjYTIyMGVhMjQ1MmY5MGI2M2NmYWJjNGM2NDgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The greatlady no doubt knew Amelia Spoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Asclepius</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and would understand that was what Serena meant by </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">magic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. With that thought in mind… perhaps Katalin’s purple eyes resulted from that mysterious word </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMwZjI2YzNmM2Q1YTQyMGU4NmNhNDk4ZGViZTI1OGY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">No… that didn’t make sense. Katalin’s eyes had become a brilliant blue when she Spoke </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Alinyah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It didn’t match it would give her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">purple</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> eyes. Maybe it was the result of a different Word? Was it possible Katalin was a Second-Word Speaker? As much as that seemed outrageous for someone as young as the Northerner, Serena couldn't refuse the possibility after seeing her skill with the blade.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjQ4ODk5MDU5ODQ3ZjRiNTdkOGFjYzU1ZGY2MWU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Amelia existed, didn’t she?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODAxYjYyYTg1ODQ1MTFiNjBiNzg3NGQ1ZGZhMTIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as the conversation reached a natural lull, a house employee announced that the food was ready. Everyone stood up and made their way to the dining table. Serena, and she suspected everyone else, did their best to ignore all the peeka hair clinging to Amelia’s clothing. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzlkMmE4YTg5YjQ0YzViNDk1MWY4NjgxOGI0YjNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was strange. Ignoring a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Greatlady</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to play with a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">peeka </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">would normally be a catastrophic failure of etiquette that could be fatal to the reputation of a newly-formed house. Yet somehow, Amelia had once again gotten away with being Amelia.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODVlYzM4N2Q2YzQ0NzA5NDdjZWMzNjg1NzhlN2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their dinner was a traditional Samino multi-dish meal. They each went through a dozen different dishes, ranging from small appetisers to artistically arranged cuts of fish and meat that had been steamed, fried, and sometimes flame-grilled. In between meats, they had a light palate-cleanser soup or a vegetable dish. They then had steamed sardis for the penultimate dish, the aroma of which made everyone's mouth water. Finally, they finished with a frozen sugarfruit dessert.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTAwNzczNmFiOTQ1MzZhM2YwZTBiODM5ZDdlNTAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from the mid-meal drama where Amelia and Lani were caught passing bits of fish under the table to Poro who had somehow snuck in, the meal passed with no further prodding from Ashina regarding the secret identity of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speaker.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDZjYzM1YzZiNjQ2NTVhMTcxMzJmZWFlMmEwYzIz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your chefs are incredible,” Ashina announced after the dishes had been cleared and replaced with glasses of blue loqua. “If we had room in our estate, I wouldn’t be able to resist stealing them!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTNhYzU3YTc5NzQxNGNiNjQwZjg5MmU0MzIyNTEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will pass on your compliments, Greatlady,” Serena’s father said, bowing his head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTVlNmZiMmIyNzRkZTE4ODQ5YWI5MTFlZDhkYzhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And Amelia, my dear. You </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">must</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> come and meet my friends! They’re dying to meet you! Some have been sending invitations, and your lack of an answer has been most upsetting! We’ve been placing bets on who will be accepted first!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2JiNDE5MzE4ZTQ4MDE4MzQyNTc4NjIyODBlMGE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve tried to answer them all!” Amelia explained. “But… I get so many and it takes up so much time writing a polite refusal every time…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTk1MjY3N2YyMTRlZDlhOGJiNjljZjhmMWE3NDg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At her words, Ashina laughed. “Yes, I imagine you must be receiving quite a lot of letters. I understand you’re leaving the East soon, but you can’t avoid high society forever, Amelia! At some point, you’ll have to embrace the delicious food and womanly gossip!” The greatlady took a sip of her loqua and continued, “When you return, I’ll be insisting on you attending an event at our estate. Don’t think about refusing! I’ll make Takahiro order you to come if I have to!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjFiZTY5YWEwODQ0NzdhMjM0NmYyZTEzYjczMTg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm… thank you?” Amelia said, smiling awkwardly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjc5YjI4OTM1MjRjNDc5MmEyNjkzYWM0YzcwMzZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re welcome,” Ashina said, lightly tapping the side of her glass. “Besides, we might meet sooner than you think. You may only be a Lord-Prospect, but if the rumours I’ve heard hold true, you’ll be receiving an invitation to the Cellian Golden Ball!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjhiMmZlNWRjNTQ3NTU5NGQyNGM5YTFjYTc2NTVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">At Ashina’s words, Serena felt her eyes widen. She wasn’t the only one in shock. “Surely you jest, Ashina!” her mother exclaimed. “They wouldn’t do that!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGVlN2Q0NzU3ZTRmMmRiYWM4N2Q4ODNiNDlkYTU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s the Cellian Golden Ball?” Amelia asked innocently.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjUxMjkxMWUyMjRhZGZhMGJkMGQ4NTFmYzI2NmJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ashina coughed into her glass. Serena, who was used to Amelia asking about gaps in her knowledge, quickly explained, “The Cellian Golden Ball is the most prestigious gathering of Cascadian Lords in the Empire. Invitations are generally only given to Highlords and above, with only a few going to exceptional Lords whom the Empress wants to show recognition. A Lord-Prospect has never been invited. At least, not to my knowledge.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDRkNTdkMzY5NDQyMGFiOWY0OTdhZTNiZTRiZjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Never,” Ashina added, padding her mouth delicately with a tissue. “Which begs the question: Will the invitation read </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect Thornheart,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> or will it read </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? Who knows, you might break a record for the shortest time of having Vikram sanction full Cascadian Lordship upon someone!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzYxMTlhMTg3YjRkOGU5ZDViYjAyMzNhYTBhN2Ix" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh,” Amelia sighed. “Sounds like a bother…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDdiYjQwMDlkMzRiYzk4YmU0ZTgwMTlmYzNhMjdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena’s grandmother cackled while her mother and Ashina looked mortified.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjE5M2MxYWU0YzQ3NDNhMjUyNTU3NGZiMTlhOThh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s the spirit!” Serena’s grandmother exclaimed. “Young Thornheart here has more </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">grit</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in her little finger than most Lords do today! The standards are dropping, I tell you! Back in my day, you had to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">earn</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> a lordship! You-”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGI3YTlkMDY1YzRmNzliMGZhMGUzN2VmOTg4MjQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, thank you, Grandmother,” Serena’s mother interrupted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2Y4ZWE5MzgwNzRmYjhiYzI4YWRlYzA1MmRkMTJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just giving my opinion,” mumbled the elderly demon before reaching out and pouring herself some more loqua.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmFhOTg4NTI2ZTQ1YmVhY2MzMjE1YjI0OWU4OGQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well,” Ashina intoned, her usual smile returning. “Now I’m </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">definitely </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">looking forward to the event. I hope the rumours turn out to be true! Remember, Amelia,” Ashina said, raising a finger. “The invitation, despite its nature as an invitation, is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> optional. Each one is signed by the Empress herself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTE4NTU0NzYxNjQzZDc4NTU1ZTdlMjBkYWY3MGEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” Amelia rubbed her nose. “So I’ll need a good excuse? Maybe I’ll accidentally drop it off the ship's side or something when we’re getting shot at.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2M4ZmExMjRlNjRkYTQ4NTQ2ZWMwYmQ3MzU3NmFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena couldn’t help but laugh at the sight of the astonished faces of her mother and Greatlady Oshiro. Once again, her resistance against Amelia’s casual outbursts had saved her. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjI5MDMyYmU0NDRlNTQ4ZmNkOGVkMTgzN2M5OWRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was refreshing to see someone else experience the chaos instead.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWQ5MGJiN2U3MDRmN2Q5MmFkOTQ2ZDgxYjEzODA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This is what I have to live with</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, Serena thought, taking a sip of loqua. Despite her thoughts, she wasn’t complaining. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmYwOTNiMjQwNTQxN2U5NGY1ZTBlMmUwMDk0N2Rk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">For she couldn’t imagine living any other way.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDA1MGQwNGRlNDQ5NjNiM2VmYWFmMGFmZjZhMzZm" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not since she fell in love.</span></p>

      <description>Chapter Eighty-One: Secret Identity II</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM1MGFlMzlhZTBiNTQwMWViM2M1NDZlZGI4ZTY3MzU4"><img alt="image" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/amelia.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNmMDIyMzJmMTc3OTRkYmFhZjIwMmZiYTIxYzRlMjY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">On the morning of Katalin’s last session, Amelia and Serena entered the training ground together. Any expectations Amelia had for a special final session taught by Katalin were soon dashed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2NkMWNmYmQ2YzQwMzM5ZjAyMjhjYTUzMGNmODI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Given recent events,” Katalin explained. “I don’t think the Grandmaster would be too happy if I carried out the finale I had originally planned, yes?” Katalin smiled and continued, “We will focus on individual training for both sessions this morning. I’ll walk around and adjust your forms as I see fit. Meanwhile, remember all the previous lessons we’ve taken together. Use whatever style you want.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yjc4Y2RhODNkNjQzNWFhMGZmMDgxN2I1MjgyMzMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The instructors split off and began a variety of training methods. Some focused on meditation, refining their aura. Others concentrated on the more aggressive aura-stepping routines, quickly building a sweat. A few instructors practised their </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shimokan</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> katas while others practised the northern </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">hawk</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> style. Whatever they did, Katalin was there to give constructive advice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjVkZTk4OWY5NDQzODg4MDgxZDNhMzQxOTY3ODU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your shoulders rise when you transition, see?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWE1NjgxMzM0MDQ2OTlhOGRlNWRjOWVhOGMxODg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Narrow your convection, then slowly increase the speed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDcwYzQ4YTEyYTRmNzU5YmMzNmEyNjJmY2NlNzdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re flaring your aura too late. Time it with the strike.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGUyMzdlMDRmNTQyYTE4YjEzNzYwMTIwYjIwYjkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Keep the stomach in, away from a potential counterattack.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmMxMDU1NWZlZjRiZWViYTdjNTY4Nzg0ZmQxZjcw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a very ordinary training session, akin to what the academy normally provided. Amelia thought that, in a way, it was a fitting end to Katalin's series of exhausting and demanding sessions. Everyone was in a good mood, taking the opportunity to compare techniques and offer suggestions to each other. Amelia herself didn’t quite have the insight needed to join these conversations, so she focused on her kata while keeping an ear out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGNhMDk0ZjNmYTQwM2RiODVmZjhmNDVmMWUwMjRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, nobody who knew the truth of the last session mentioned anything. The others knew that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">something</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> had transpired but thankfully didn’t try and ask. They knew better than that. Amelia did, however, get to see an awkward-looking Serena when Katalin offered some advice regarding her future communion with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Serena was nodding thoughtfully, but Amelia could tell Serena was thinking about how, only a few days ago, she had rubbed Katalin’s face into the sand!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTlmYzhjYzRjYzQwMzdhMGUyMmRiOTUwMDMyZjU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shaking her head to suppress a giggle, Amelia finished her kata training and began refining her aura. At this point, she’d managed to bring the size of her aura down to a level that resembled an average second-year student. However, Amelia’s red aura was unusual - far larger and more intense than most. As a result, her ordinary-looking aura hid a frightening amount of power that could defend against far more than red aura normally could.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNThkNjFhNzg5NDQ2NDQ4ZDRlNDRlN2IxYzE3MWFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before she could push to orange, Katalin and Serena told her to focus on making her aura as invisible as possible. Those with a keen insight would still pick up on the intensity of her aura if they looked closely. If she wanted to pass for an ordinary aura user, she would need to refine it further.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTM2ZTExZmRkMDQ2MmE5YWNiY2RjZWEwZjA4MjRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She focused on aura refinement until the end of the session. There was no second part this time; since the session had been so lightweight everyone had stayed on after the half-way mark and continued what they were doing. At the end, everyone lined up and bowed to Katalin, expressing their gratitude for her assistance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDRmNTBhZTgwMjRlOWJiZjQxZWM2NjVmYjNlYjUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’ll be hard to match Instructor Driss’s intensity ourselves!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWM3NDAwNGI3ZTQ4ZmVhNzg1NGIyY2MzYzI1MDZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looking back, I gained as many insights here as I did on the battlefield!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWVmM2QxZTE1ODQwYjU5Y2I3NTg1NTMwODg0Yzhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s true what they say, you never stop learning the sword…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzQ2M2YzYTFjNjQzMTBhZWI3OGZhMzg1ZWFlZGMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel like a student again!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGYyMTk1Y2YyOTRiMjU4N2Q0YmFkODZiMzA5ODNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They chatted amongst themselves while people filtered out one by one, giving Katalin their final expressions of appreciation. Soon, only Amelia and Serena remained.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGExYTQ1NzViZDQxOTA5ZjZhOWExNDZiYTUzZjY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instructor Driss, no, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlord</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Serena said, bowing to the purple-eyed northerner. “It was an honour to train with you. I will remember everything you taught me. I will never let anyone disparage the might of the North’s horns.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGM4MDcxZjRjMjRiYzNiZjYyMmI4MjVmZjJlOTU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were an excellent student,” Katalin replied. “If you ever find yourself in the North, then stop by the Driss family estate and say hello. I’ll make the time, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjhlMmYyYTQ3NjRmYmY4Mjk1NDk0NDllMzMyYTUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.” Serena bowed again.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDQxMWQ4NzU2NjRkZGFiYzY2ZDM5M2Q3OGU2MDVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm…” Amelia began, looking at Serena and then at Katalin. “There’s something I wanted to ask, but it’s, uh…” Amelia raised an eyebrow awkwardly, throwing an apologetic look towards Serena. “It’s private, I think?” Serena tilted her head, her forehead furrowing. “No, I mean, there’s a personal training question I wanted to ask. I’ll tell you about it later!” she said reassuringly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTZjMDk0OGY2MTRkMDY4MTNiZDljNjY5NmI4N2Zk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Serena didn’t seem to understand fully but understood enough to know Amelia wanted to ask Katalin something in private. “I’ll be outside,” Serena intoned. With a final bow at the entrance of the training hall, she exited, leaving Amelia alone with Katalin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTljYzM2MzE3MDRiODQ5YTc1MmRmMDFhNzRjY2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few seconds passed while neither of them said anything.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzJiZGIxMjAwNzQ3OTY5YWFhZDM1M2ZkODQ0ZmJi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">How awkward! Since when were the training halls </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> silent!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2Q5M2M0NGFmNzRkZTJiMjllZWI2ZjE5OWQ4MjIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what did you want to discuss?” Katalin asked, her purple eyes blinking twice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGMwZjBjMjY3NjQxMjliN2UwMjI4OTFjNDgyNTk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” Amelia rubbed the back of her neck. “It’s difficult to ask.” Amelia opened her mouth before closing it again. What if she was wrong? Her instincts told her she was right, but it wasn’t exactly a casual matter! “Umm…” Amelia mumbled, lifting her weight onto her toes and back down. “I was… wondering…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjhjMDIyMjBiMTQxZThhYjMwOWNlNzY4ZDFhZWE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a question,” Katalin said suddenly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzY4MDM4ZDY1ZjQ0YTdhZTA4YjhhMWIwN2ZjNDNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, yes!?” Amelia jumped at the chance for a distraction.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWRiYjg5OGVmMTQyOWNiNDk4M2VmMGY3NDlkMDIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You and Instructor Halen,” Katalin began, looking at Amelia with a firm gaze. “You two are in love, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTE3ZDA3ZjcyZDQ1OGY4MGI0MzZjNTA5YTE2NjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if Amelia had wanted to deny such a happy truth, her mouth immediately formed into what must have been an idiotic grin. “Yes!” Amelia answered. “Awfully, terribly, unstoppably so! How did you know!? Wait!” Amelia’s eyes widened. “It wasn’t you who reported us, was it!?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmM4Yzk5ZDc2MDQ4YzFiMjg0NTljNzVlZGRiOTg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Katalin shook her head slightly. “That was another staff member.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmVlY2E0MGEwZDQwOWI4MjBjYzE0MzliMzJiNzM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How… how do you know that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjMyMmUwNWQ5NjQ3ZGJhNzJjMjQ0YTNjYmEwN2Ix" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Someone informed me.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTE4ZjM4ODQzOTQwZmRiYjY4NjFjM2M1NTE3ODFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGI0NjRiMDczMTQ0NTlhMDQxYzYwZTkxMzQ2ZDI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Half a dozen seconds passed before Katalin asked, “Do you want to know who it was?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGQzOWEyMGM2MTQ5MjRiOTQwNzU1MjJhNjIxOTNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh,” Amelia mumbled. She scrunched her nose and rubbed it. Did she want to know? Her first instinct was to say ‘Yes,’ but what if it was someone she respected? What if it were Ryosuke or Instructor Kawas? What if it were Lunaria? Besides, she was leaving the East in a few days. Did she need to end it on a negative note?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTQ1ODAxMTA4YjQ2YmU5NGIxYjg0NjM1OTA1ODQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of all the intriguing mysteries of this world, who did and who didn’t report her behaviour wasn’t something she felt she should care about. Those grumpy fools who hadn’t yet realised how amazing and cute she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Serena were together could remain grumpy fools for all eternity!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWM1ZmFjMzBmYzRhNzViMWZhYjcyMjY3MmE1NzQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess I’m more interested in how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> figured it out,” Amelia said, pointing at Katalin before quickly putting her hand down, remembering her etiquette lessons.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2RkNWFlNzIzODQ3ZTFiNjI5MDM1MzdkYjI5NGUz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well,” Katalin replied, her mouth curling into a smile. “Instructor Halen is more subtle with her reactions, but you are not. Your heartbeat speeds up when you are close to her. When you look at her, your eyes dilate.” Katalin leaned in. “It is noticeable when you know what you’re looking for. Even now, your cheeks are flushed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTJiOWYxYTU4YzRmMWI5MTg4YmE3MzJhZThjNzNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia’s hand snapped to her cheeks, feeling a familiar warmth. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDM1NGJlZjhmYzQxNmJhNThhM2M5YjhjODkxZWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry,” Amelia said with an awkward smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzI5MWI0YTExNDRlN2NhNTNjNGE2MGI2YWFiNjI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing to apologise for,” Katalin replied. “Besides, you are proud of your relationship, yes? Never apologise for love.” The Northerner’s face flickered to an unusual expression and back so quickly Amelia almost missed it. “No matter what it costs,” Katalin finished, her jaw clenched.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzM1MGU5ZTI4NjRlNGNiMjMxZjQ3YmY2NjdiODNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did you bring it… I mean, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">us,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> up?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWU3YjY2OTI2ZDQ3MWQ5YjZhYjk4MTdhZjBlZDU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In these times, your presence is a breath of fresh air.” Katalin sighed, taking a few steps away so her back was towards Amelia. “There is too much suffering in the Empire, too much stress. It’s nice to bear witness to such… innocent happiness. Don’t underestimate your influence on those around you. Serena Halen was known to me as the Hellfire Captain with a cold heart that had frozen over after losing her brother. Yet, when we finally met, her heart was warm.” Katalin turned her head slightly. “That warmth came from you, I think.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2NmZDgxYmU4MzQ2ZWI4OGRjYjBlZGIzM2M0MmY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks!” Amelia felt her confidence rise. She </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> been a wonderful influence on Serena, hadn’t she? Sure, Serena sometimes clutched her horns here and there, but really, it was just because she was so overwhelmed by Amelia’s cuteness, wasn’t it!? And on those rare occasions when she clutched her horns due to stress, Amelia would be there to heal it!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzM2M2FlMjFmNDQyOWFhYzFhYjFlYWNmMGUxNGFi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, your question to me?” Katalin asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWI5ZjY2YWFhMDQ2MTZiZGYyNWRiYzg0N2VkMjc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh right. That.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGE2NzMzZWE2MTQ5YTJhZDEzZWIzMzhhMzdmM2Y0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, as she always said: Nothing ventured, nothing gained!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTkzNjg4OTVlOTQ1OWU4YzA3ODJjZjY5MzIxYjJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You came at me with such a serious question so suddenly, you won’t blame me for doing the same to you?” Amelia asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzg5OTg0MmQ5ZTRmNDFhZmYxMzY3ZTU0NDc1MzUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh?” Katalin’s eyebrow raised. “I’m interested. Let’s hear it, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Assistant Instructor Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” The demon’s eyes sparkled with a sudden intensity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzlhODA3MmRmYzQ1ZjlhOTlmY2RhYTUxNWVkOGEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia swallowed, and before her mind could get in the way of her mouth, she quickly asked, “I was just wondering if </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin of Driss</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a real person or someone you invented so you could train prospective talents and Speakers?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmY4YmM2YmUwMTRiZWRiODFkMjU1OTJkMjJkZWJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">One second.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWE5NTlhMjY3NTQ2MGM5Nzg2NDg4OTA2ZGEwODY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Six seconds. Amelia began chewing her lip.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjgxMGRjMjVmNjQ2OWVhMDYyNDRmZTM4NTY4NDQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ten seconds. What if she’d been wrong?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTkyZWI1ZTU4ODRhNWViYmY3ODczMzJiMzNhNjIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a dozen seconds, Katalin responded.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTk1OWNkMTU1ODRlZmE4MDU3ODQ3N2Q0OWZiNTc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a… perceptive question,” Katalin said slowly, her voice even and calculated. “One I didn’t think you would ask so soon.” The demon turned to face Amelia with a look that seemed to see through all her cloaks and defences. “What is it that has raised such suspicions about my identity?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTBkNTA3Y2NmODQ2OGI5OGY5OGU3OThmYWI4M2Nm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, umm…” Amelia raised a finger. “Mysterious renowned beauty and swordmaster that hides away, only appearing to train Northern Speakers.” She raised another finger. “That same mysterious individual just so happens to appear at the academy Serena and I are instructing at just before our </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">important</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> duties.” Another finger. “Your eyes are supposed to be green, but they’re purple and turned blue - their </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">real</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> colour when you Spoke - and most of all…” A final finger was raised. “Your soul.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzMzZTU0MTdkMzQ3MmViYzJiN2FjOTYwMmY2OWRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My soul?” Katalin’s head tilted slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjdiYjUzN2Y0NzQ1ZTU4ZjA1MjhjM2UyYmMyMTRh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The cloaking is excellent, but when I flare my aether and look at it through the Shimmer, I can see the shadow of something larger, and-” Amelia spoke faster, her excitement getting to her, “When I looked at it under </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Aseco</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> I caught glimpses of its true nature! I don’t understand how you’ve hidden it so well, but it wasn’t enough for me! I thought you were limiting yourself during the fight!” She jabbed a celebratory thumb at herself. “So, am I right!?”</span></p><span class="cmU4OGY3ZjcwYjI2YTRhMTlhNTA1YTlkMjNjZGY1NTNl"><br/>Stolen from its rightful author, this tale is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlNzc5Y2Y5YzhjYTQxODI5MjY5ZDFlMDBiN2RiNjAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...I wonder,” Katalin mused. “There are all manner of strange souls in the Known World, yours included. Well…” Katalin softly sighed, her eyes looking away thoughtfully before snapping back to meet Amelia’s. “If I am whoever you think I am, what would you do with that information?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmQzMWRjZjk1YTRkZGI4MDQwZDdkNTc3NzAwZWU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanted to say thank you!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWM3MTczMmUwMTQ5YjM5MWE5YjIyMTA1ZDNkNTVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTQxMmQ4ZjcwNzRiNjM4NGNhMDBmYmFmYjljZDcw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For training me and Serena! I agree that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is right for her second First-Word! So…” Amelia bowed deeply. “Thank you for helping her on that path and helping me reach red aura! And…” Amelia rose, casting her best smile towards the demon in front of her. “Thank you for healing Mel! She would have died if you weren’t here!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzRlNWIzNWIwZTQzY2ViNDI3NTNhMjc2ZjkyYTky" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin was silent for a few moments. “You’re </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">perceptive,” she eventually muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjFhMzRlNmEyZDQyYzE5NGM4MWFhMjg1YTg5MDY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry,” Amelia said, tilting her head in apology. “It just made sense. What was more likely? That another powerful human healer had appeared and somehow evaded all detection while saving and healing Mel… or…” Amelia twiddled her thumbs. “It was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Yjg4ODFjOGM5YzQ4YzQ5NzhlNGRlMTkxMWUxNDM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here you are, thanking me for such small things,” Katalin said. As she spoke, her voice lost more and more of its Northern accent and speaking patterns. “Meanwhile, it is I who wanted to offer you my gratitude. For invoking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Suijin </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and putting that dreadful fire out.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzI4YzlhZGUyYTQwMDNiODk3Y2IxOTFlOTc4MDli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm! No problem!” Amelia nodded happily. “Only… why didn’t you do it yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTM1NGNkMmEzNjRkNjFiNDE2NzMzNjQ4NjczNWFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are… limitations,” Katalin replied. “Lines that are difficult for me to cross. Legal ones.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmE2NDRlZTgzNzQ4ZTA4MDhkYzU5NTJkZGNmZmUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would have thought the law would have been the least of your concern?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjQ1NDk4YjJjNDQ0MmM4YTc4MjRhNmZmNjQ1MmM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin shook her head. “We are bound by more than mere mortal laws. There are accords that even the gods dare not go against. You, however…” Katalin smiled, looking Amelia up and down. “Are lucky. You’ve gained tremendous power without the normal restraints. This is both a blessing and a curse. I pray that you understand why.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjU1NDU1ZGVmOTQ5Zjk4M2I4NTFlNGIyYjE0MDgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do! It’s scary at times,” Amelia said truthfully. “But it’s becoming easier every day to control. A lot of that is thanks to your training! It really helped! Umm…” Amelia chewed her lips briefly before continuing, “I wanted to ask about my, well, about </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">our</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> powers. Our </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">souls</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Why do they…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTliYWY3YmUwMDQ3ODFhMzFhMmM1NTlmNDAwNDA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Feel so familiar?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjhiYTAzNDFjMzQwZDE4OWQ0ZWZjNmI4N2UwNjhm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!” Amelia blurted out. Under the influence of the First-Word, the shadow of Katalin’s titanic secret power made itself known. While that was a shock, what was even more surprising was how </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">similar</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Katalin’s soul was to Amelia’s own. There was an odd sense of familiarity between them. It was why Amelia had been so trusting when Katalin requested her to drop her wards and fight while being completely vulnerable. There was a strange connection between them. Different from the connection between her and Serena. It was more like the connection of…</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjdmYzdmYmFlMzQxMGFhNjcyN2QwZDg4ZWRlNTA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Family.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGUwNzNmZWMzNjRlZjNhYjk5M2E4NGJiYWQ2N2Ji" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s because our powers originate from the same source,” Katalin said evenly. “Although, your binding seems to have taken place many centuries after…” The demon blinked twice. “Or perhaps it happened simultaneously, and it took that long for you to return. Time flows differently in the mists, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjI0OWIzNWMxYjQyNTliNDVmNzFlNjg4MTMzODY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Binding?” Amelia frowned. “I don’t remember being </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">bound</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to anything!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGVmZTRlODIzODRkN2M4MTBkNGU0YjIyYjI5NzU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps not, but you remember your affliction? I listened to the recording of when you arrived. What did you call it? </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Chronic Endothelial Collapse Syndrome?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> You told Captain Halen your world didn’t know where it came from.” Katalin tilted her head sympathetically. “It’s understandable. Your realm doesn’t have a manifested aetherfield. Your body wouldn’t have been able to handle the amount of aether forced into it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTJjODZlYjc2ZjRiNDJiNDZlNmQyM2IzZjBkZTNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Aether?” Amelia whispered, feeling an ominous conclusion manifesting.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2EwNzUyYzk4NDQ2NjE4ZWEzNGM2YjNjMmZiMWY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Deterioration of the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels,” Katalin said, recalling the symptoms of Amelia’s disease. “This is what you described to Captain Halen, and they also happen to be the same symptoms that follow when an aether user flares for too long or when a Speaker loses control of a Word. It’s a miracle the medicine of your world kept you alive for so long.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDY2NWU0OTdlODRiODRhMmYyZWFjMjM3ZTBiNDIy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia felt herself swallow, a lump of emotion forming in her throat. “So everything that happened to me… was because of my </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">magic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!? I was always… a mage!? Are you saying I could have healed myself the entire time!?” Amelia sniffed, feeling her eyes brim with tears.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTdhZTU2NDg5YzQyMzc5MGI4ZGY2NWUwYzEyODIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps, perhaps not.” Katalin shrugged. “Your world is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">aetherphobic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It would have been extremely challenging for a native to use magic of any kind. The laws of your world would have fought against you. I suspect it wasn’t until your old body died and your soul travelled into the mists that it was able to bond with your shard properly.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTE1MTNkMjBlNjQ3ODY5NjlkNjU0Y2E5NDJkMGY3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s it then? The source of my power?” Amelia asked quietly, wiping away the tears that were about to run down her cheeks. “I’m a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">shardbearer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?” She hadn’t forgotten the name Chesterfield had used to describe those who had bonded with shards of the fractured soul the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> protected.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGFlZjEwZTdmZTQ1MWU5MjIxY2I4MzI0ZDMzMGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Katalin answered. “As am I. There are others. Not all of them demon or human.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWQ1NTk4MTg0ODQ1OGY4Nzg2MjJmNGZlYzM5NTE3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia sighed. An odd feeling of relief washed through her. It wasn’t the most surprising revelation. She’d suspected the possibility for a while now, and although neither her nor Serena had ever vocalised it, she was sure her girlfriend had put the pieces of the puzzle together as well. If some shard of this shattered soul had given Amelia all her abilities, then did that mean…?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2NhYzEzMzNjZDQ2OWQ5OThkNTg4MTA1MzYzZDZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chesterfield said that shards can find other shards. Is that why I appeared on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vengeance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjIzMzM0MDRiYzRlZjBiZGJmY2E3NWNhNjA0ZWRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shards want to be whole, so they’ll naturally attract each other. Fate will bring you together eventually. It’ll happen far quicker if you’re actively </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">searching</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Katalin smiled, raising a flat palm. “Hence Captain Halen’s and your new duties. To do what I cannot.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODkyZTc1YzNjOTQyMWE5OGZkMmEyZGY4MjIxNWNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-whose soul is it?” Amelia suddenly asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2VlMjYyNGZmMjRiYWZiN2Q1NWY5ZDBhNjIwYTg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t give you all the answers,” Katalin said with a slight shrug. “Some you’ll need to find yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTg4MTJhMzUzMDQ5MWVhNjgxYjg5OTBhZDE0NjAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia couldn’t help but open her mouth in both surprise and annoyance. “Are you serious!?” she protested. “You’re going to hold your cards close to your chest </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">now</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!? I was just getting some answers! You’re doing it on purpose, aren’t you!” She knew it was rude but still pointed an accusatory finger at the demon in disguise. “Stop being so mysterious! It’s annoying!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjVhN2IzNDMyNzRjYTliMjRjZTI2N2M1NThiZWQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin raised a hand to her mouth, laughing softly. “As much as I enjoy having a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">mysterious aura</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, my motivation is far simpler.” She raised a finger at Amelia. “If I tell you the Empire’s most important secrets, then you’ll run straight to Captain Halen and tell her, won’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjY4MzM1ZmU3MDQ0OWI4NWU5MjNjNGQ5MzA2MTVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia crossed her arms and puffed her cheeks out. “Obviously I would! But Serena can be trusted every bit as much as I can! We can keep secrets!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODU4MTVjNDk5OTRjYjFiOTkwMDJlYzEyNzk2MDE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Funny thing about secrets,” Katalin responded with a wry smile. “Once more than one person knows them, they very quickly lose their status as being </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">secret</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. And…” The demon rubbed her chin slowly, looking upwards. “Understand that some things are unpleasant for me to talk about. The past holds a lot of pain, and digging up too much too fast can cause problems.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzQxZGYwZjQ3MTRiMDg5MTU5YThmZWE0M2I2NzQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine…” Amelia nodded slowly. “But I’ll have to tell her about…” She waved a hand at the demon in front of her. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">You!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> I can’t wait to see her face when I tell her who’s been training her all this time!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWI2ZTRjNGZiNzQ5MjFhMDlhODAxZDQyM2JjMDZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would like to see that,” Katalin said. “Just make sure you’re alone when you tell her, and wait until you leave the East. Can you do that, my Lord-Prospect?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWExYzhkYTJkODRmOGI5MzA5YTM4OGZiYzU3N2E3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded. “I can wait that long! Oh, and you can just call me Amelia!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDU4YWVhNzBjMzRjNGZhZGViNTE1MGZkOGJiNGI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin chuckled. “A Lord-Prospect permitting </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">me</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be casual. How bold… I can imagine Theresa’s face already.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODViZjFiZjVkMjRiMDM5YWE0NjIwMWYwZjA1Y2I5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who’s Theresa?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDQ2OWNjOThmNDQwZTZhNTFhMzU1N2U4MzgxZGE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An old friend,” Katalin replied. “I think I’ve answered enough questions.” The demon glanced towards the door. “We’ve kept Captain Halen waiting long enough.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODEzNjc3ZGRiZDQ0MTQ5Y2E5NzQ3NmM5ZmNmZGM0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait!” Amelia cried. “I still have so much I wanted to ask you! About the Empire, about the animal gods, about the lumina, and the Shimmer! I wanted to ask you about the Needles of Nai, and the Dectus Lines! Oh! And the giant skull they found underneath Centralis, and your Thousand Blades, and..” Amelia took a breath before frantically continuing, describing all the fascinating mysteries and historical questions she was sure the demon could answer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjY0NTU4ZjZlMDQ0Njc4ZjkyNjJjZTMwZjVlMjRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll meet again,” Katalin answered. “In Centralis. You can ask me then, although given your next destination, I’m sure you’ll find the answers to some of those questions yourself. You should relax and enjoy the journey.” Katalin’s expression suddenly turned serious. “We have a brief respite as this conflict ends, but it’s always quiet before the storm. Believe me, a storm </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> coming.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzZmYWJlZDNjYTRlNTU4OThjNjIzMDFhMDg3Njk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia swallowed. “We’ll be okay, right? The Empire and… everyone in it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMThkMTE3NWZhNjQ3OTBiNTQzNDFiYzgwNzdiZjZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are plans,” Katalin said. “Plans that have been in motion for a very long time. We’re preparing for the future, and whether you want to take an active role in that is a choice you’ll have to make. For now…” The demon's expression lightened. “Enjoy your adventures, and make plenty of pleasant memories. That’s my order to you, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord-Prospect Amelia Thornheart</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjBjNWJkMDZkMjRjYjQ5YjJlYmIxMmJiMjJjNDY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia eagerly saluted. It wasn’t exactly the proper response, but it felt right in the moment. “Mmm! I won’t disappoint you!” She bowed quickly. “Thank you for everything again!” Amelia rose up. “I won't-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzliZDg1ZTg1MzQ3ZDhhNjIxNjliNDVjMjA1YmYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katalin was gone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2Q2YTA2NGEzMTQwZjA5YzBkYmNhNDc0NmNhN2I1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia immediately flipped her perception into the Shimmer, but nothing was there. After thirty seconds of trying to find a trace of Katalin, Amelia gave up and exited the training hall. In the hallway she saw Serena leaning against the wall, looking as cool as ever.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTFiMTMwYjY0YTQxM2JiY2YyNTUwYWUyYjU5MDBi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what was that about?” her girlfriend asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDcxZmRkZGE0YzQwZjU4MzBiODBlOWNlNjM4YzFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe,” Amelia said with a giggle. “I just needed to clarify a few things; I’ll tell you about it soon, I promise!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGNkZjk3YjJiNjQyMzA4OTM5MDk1ZGYzYTg3NmRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, now I’m intrigued,” Serena said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWFlZWI1MGQ5ZjRkMTc4OWNmYzlhYmJkYTI4NzBl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">They walked down the corridor while Serena tried to get Amelia to spill the secret.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTJkMmNlODJmNTQ3YmVhY2Q5MGY3NGJmNGQwYTQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she wouldn’t give in that easily. She would tell Serena </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">soon</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTczMjZiMmUxMDQxMGRhZTAwMzY0OWRhNDgzYzFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But she’d make sure to pick the most opportune moment!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjlkNTVkNTE5YzQ0OWRhZmIyY2VlMjRlZDAwNjQz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Serena was becoming increasingly resistant to Amelia’s attempts to shamelessly bother her! She needed to maximise the horn-clutching effect!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Yjk1Y2Y3ZDg4ODQzMzk4YzcwY2M3NDdkNzc2OGRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Giggling at the future, Amelia skipped happily down the corridor, thinking of all the adventure and pleasant memories yet to come!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjQ0ZmExN2E4YzQyYjRhMjNhMjgwNDJkMGY2ZTY4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">And, if the future was dark, then she’d become a beacon of light.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODJlM2NkYjJhYzRjZTA5MzYwZjY2MDU5YjRlNGI0" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">This world was her home, after all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDBkZWUzODhlYjQ1ZjU4NjFiNWFmZDk4NDBhYTE0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMGQ0NTM0MzQ5ZDRhNmI4M2UwMTNjODlkMmM5MmM0"><img alt="image" src="https://cdn.novelpets.net/amelia_thornheart/elana.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnMzZjIxYjcyYWY1NjQyYjU5ZDJlMjZhNGU5ZDQ4MjRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empress of Demonkind, Elana, waited until her Lord-Prospect was bowing before making her move. She found her otherworldly shadow and stepped into it, transporting herself into the Shimmer. Centuries of practice meant she could make the transfer flawlessly. There would be no sound or smell to give away her actions.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjlmYTc3Y2M0YjQ5MjFhMjE0ZDYwMWIzMWFiODkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it wasn’t enough.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjI5ZmVlOThmNDQyMmY4MTIxN2YwMDliYjA2YjFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amelia Thornheart could look into the Shimmer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2E2ZTY5YTY4ZDQ3YjU4ZTE1NzFmNjlhM2FmOTMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">So, Elana took a second step, passing from the Shimmer into the deeper realm of reality beyond.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWUxOGYzZWEzYTRmNjRhNzM1OTFkNWFkMDczOGVm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Lustrate.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDYzODFlMjg3MDRjNTJiYTE5MzIyYmUyNmMzMzlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Here, Amelia’s titanic soul displayed its full brilliance. Its radiant hues captivated Elana’s attention, keeping her eyes transfixed on the soul that had engorged itself on Esmeralda’s shard. She’d spent many hours secretly studying Amelia’s soul, reassuring herself of Amelia’s good and pure spirit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWM2OGU1MTY4MzQyNjQ4N2YxNDY2Yzc3MzI1YThk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Elana watched until Amelia’s soul moved towards the door, where it briefly stopped near Serena Halen’s soul. After a moment, the two lights, one massive and radiant compared to the other, made their way down the corridor.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjIyNGU1MTNhYTQxZDdiOWI0MDk0N2FlOThmMmY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t miss the glowing connection between them, formed by their love.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzlhYjFmMDYxYjQ3YjhiOTIxNDc4MGRjNmFlMjE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe if it kept growing, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Taruna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> wouldn’t be Serena Halen’s next Word after all.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTgxYWM5MzE4NzQyY2M5ZTNmYzE0YmMwYjVkYmI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Elana sighed, turning away and walking through the wall towards Theresa. Unlike the Shimmer, real-world objects posed no obstacle. Only the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Lustrum</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, the otherworldly forest that manifested in the Shimmer as ghostly fauna, held any corporeal weight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmEwYjNlY2QzNzQyOTZhMmM3MWNhMDgxZDI5NmZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re done here,” Elana said to her maid. “Let’s return to Centralis. I have a meeting with the Western delegation in an hour.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWY1ZDE5MzdkODQ4MWZhYjdiYjhhN2I3ZjVlZTli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Elana began walking, only to stop when she realised Theresa wasn’t following.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmQwNzY0OWRlYTRkNzM4ZmE4YmU2NGE2MzNkNzkz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, the maid was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">glaring</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> at her!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2UzMWU2N2EwZTRlOWE5OTFiZjM3MDk5ODU4YjA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Theresa?” Elana questioned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDkyYmNlMGQ5ZDRjYThiZjNkMmIwNGM2MGFjY2M4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Divine One…” her maid responded, gritting her teeth. Theresa strode up to her, eyes filled with anger. “Who in the Seven Hells and Six Heavens do </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you think you are</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to call me </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">old!?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDdiZTY0OTY4NTQwODNiN2U0NDZjYzFjMmZiMTk5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I called you an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">old friend!”</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Elana protested, raising her hands in a gesture of peace.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWRmNjVlMWNhMzQyOTlhYWUzZTdlMzcxMTEwZGFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You still called me </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">old!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Theresa glared at her. “There’s only one way to make this right!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2U1MzczODRjYTQ0ZGE4ZDVjNGNiY2VjZWE5YWI2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empress of Demonkind sighed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDAzZWFiYmQ4NjRjMTY5NjhhZWE1MDkwYmMxZmZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d already increased Theresa's salary after the incident with that student!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzMyZDVkNzQ1NDQ0ZTY5ZjRkMWUyY2MyNzA3ZmZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now she was going to ask for another raise!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2Y5NjBiMmM0YzRmYzlhMzQxM2NiZTIwYjA1ZmU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright then…” Elana let out another sigh.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDIyM2Y4MGRlMzQ4YzE4OGMyNGI0YWI4MTE3MjEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was a greater threat to the Empire? </span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2RjMDNkMTkxODQ1OGU5ZGEzZTM3NWUzMTcwYTg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Enemy, plotting to destroy this world?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWFkOTdlM2Q5MzRkMWM4NzE0NTZiY2U3ZDNlZTkz" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Or her maid, single-handedly raiding the Empire’s treasury at every opportunity?</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNkZDI4NWIyMTg2ZTRkZjFhNmIxMTEzZWY3MzUzMjkw"><img alt="image" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd3Xreb4hmiBN2_nwQLpn9LO8gdnTWHD64zRWMG_IL1c1CMnyxR85aLA0BnNsHaTqZJC1dnk0NfvzRdoH3tzSR3xPiyEU5Xm0iSfMpGSdQ-9xX16qUx_DJR5u35A2wEJSQJSxUWbw?key=cVVs-z2eg0Ed3hl-oT1imE-G" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="600"/></p>
<p class="cnNlMjU5YTFhMjU4NTQ3NDM5MjEzMjY4N2Y2YjU3NmU1">As the final few days passed, Serena felt a growing excitement.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2I2YWNjMjRhYjRiODdhYjhlNzBkZGY5MzJiOTk1">It was an excitement of three parts.</p>
<p class="cnNmMWZjNDkxYzJkNTRiMDJhNjJkNDU5ODkwNjUxZDcx">The largest, most obvious part was the excitement of things to come. The cold winds that swept over the sloped roofs of the plateau city did little to suppress the growing excitement in the streets. It was an excitement that was visible everywhere. It could be seen in the toothy grins of young softhorns amazed at the sparkling decorations. It could be heard in the tired but satisfied sighs of their parents, who were waking up a little earlier or returning home a little later, all to work a few more hours to earn a bit more coin to make the upcoming day special.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTA5MjIyMzc0YjQ1ZjJhNmM5ZDY0N2YwZmI2Y2Ex">To Serena, it could be seen most obviously in Amelia, whose attempts at subtly inquiring about what she might want for Christmas were so naked it was difficult not to laugh.</p>
<p class="cnNmM2Y1MWUzZTZkMzRmNzI4OTRhNTUzODk1NzJlY2Jl">The second excitement was one that could be mistaken for the first. It was an excitement of that which was lacking. It could be seen in the broadsheet columns, where no longer did the headlines report on battlefield victories and growing discontent over a wartime economy, but instead they reported on peace talks and a new era of prosperity. It could be heard in the discussions of women, where their voices lacked the usual worry over losing their husbands and sons, replaced entirely by hope and anticipation.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGE0NWM5NzM4ZDRiNzM4YWQ2ODk3ODNkYmYyNTky">The final excitement was different. It was a personal excitement. One that thumped with Serena’s heartbeat and grew or shrank along with her aura. It was an excitement that was hers, but also one that she shared with those like her. It couldn’t blanket the Empire like the first or second excitement, but it didn’t need to. An excitement like this was most powerful when it was controlled, when it was kept simmering like a Word, ready to explode with sudden violence and grandeur.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTQyMjlkZjk0NzQ0Nzg4NGEzODA1Y2QxN2VmZmM3">It was the excitement of a warrior, and the excitement that Serena felt building up in herself and her colleagues as she watched the stands fill with spectators for the Asamaywa Officer Academy’s end-of-year tournament.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzU3NTc2Yzc4MzQ5MWM4Mjc2NzE0ODcyNjYyYTk2">With the exception of military talent scouts, the only people permitted to attend the tournament were students and their instructors. Down on the arena floor - where Serena and Amelia were - some students were warming up, trying to get used to the slightly spongy material they would be performing on. Others remained in the stands, silently meditating with their eyes closed, preparing for the task ahead.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjU2ZjQ2ZDU4NjRhYjNiNWMxYWZhMjY3N2RmZWVl">“Wish I could compete!” Amelia exclaimed, bouncing on the balls of her feet after Serena finished warming up her disciples. She’d joined in on the warm-up because she, as she put it, ‘Couldn’t sit still’.</p>
<p class="cnNlZmY1MWEyMDA4NzQ2MmM4Mzc0MmQxM2JlNTU4NjFl">“I don’t think that would be fair,” Mel pointed out. “Your wards are too powerful.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YTYxMDIyOGJmZTQ0YjhiY2M1YTZhOGIzODFhYWNl">“What if I only used aura?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p class="cnNkY2Q4NDU5NDkwMzRlMTliZDlmYzY2MWNiYjdhNmFh">“Speakers can’t compete,” Serena said, shaking her head. “Their increased capabilities from their communion give them too much of an advantage.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYWQxNDA0ZjhhMzQxMTk5NDQxNGU5Yzc3NmVmNjI3">“Bleh,” Amelia pouted. “Well, it’ll be fun just to watch!”</p>
<p class="cnM0YzdjYTQ3OTkwMDRmNTA5M2IyN2M3Y2VjYTRhM2Rj">Serena turned her attention to the students she’d personally trained over the last few months.</p>
<p class="cnNiNTliODZmYTFjYzQ1ZWZhMjk2YmYzYjM0N2Y3Yzg1">The reformed and capable Melanie Mori.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDFhODkyYzRhNzQ4OGJiZTkzOTFjOGIyN2MwNmU1">The quiet but powerful Flakken Holm.</p>
<p class="cnM2YThkMzE0MWY2OTRjOGU4OGIzYmE3NTkyY2MzODFi">And the cheerful twins, Ido and Arin Song.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDY5NTc3YmEzZTQxYzliNzFjODdiYzM1ZmNiZGZh">“Remember,” she said. “From the moment the duel begins, everything you do must be to further your victory. If you’re not attacking, you should be either moving yourself or manipulating your opponent into a position where you can keep attacking.” There was so much advice she wanted to give, but she knew it would overwhelm them if she bombarded them with too much. In the end, she decided to keep it simple. “If in doubt, just swing your sword,” she finished.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjU1OGY4MTc1YTRmN2E4YzhkZDMxZjliYTVmNDNh">The group nodded earnestly to her advice. Still, there was a lingering sense of nervousness around them that she didn’t miss. She could see it in their eyes, which would flick occasionally to the uniformed military talent scouts sitting in the stands. The whole situation was most likely nerve-wrecking for the trainee officers. Their performance today could mean the difference between an average contract or being offered a prestigious one that would immediately elevate their careers years ahead of their peers.</p>
<p class="cnNjM2YxMjZiNmY5MjRiN2Q4N2VhMmQ4ZGRjZTMzZmEw">Not that their performance today mattered to Serena. She’d seen what each one of them was capable of during their training sessions. She’d already decided to make an offer to each of them after graduation and even had a few names in reserve if any declined.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjgzYTA4ZDFiODQ0M2E4ODU5YmZjMDQ3MjNmODg4">“They’ll be starting soon, so spend as much time on the mats as you can,” Serena instructed, tapping her foot against the hard foam mats that formed the three separate competition areas.</p>
<p class="cnMwMzY1ZDUzMTc0YzQwZDlhYmQ1ODc0NjNhN2E3NzYy">With some final words of encouragement, she and Amelia retired to the stands, finding themselves a pair of seats with a good view. Down below, Mel was bouncing on the balls of her feet, practising combinations against an imaginary opponent with determined ferocity. In some ways, the woman reminded Serena of a younger version of herself.</p>
<p class="cnNlOGZjMDA4MTBkMzQwZTQ4Njc0NjI2ZDVlYTdjMWQ4">Flakken mainly stretched, apparently not looking to expend too much energy before the tournament started. Ido and his sister, Arin, practised their speciality <em>katas</em> on the mats. Ido had chosen an unarmed kata that consisted of slow stance changes before unleashing a flurry of upper-body strikes, while Arin had chosen a sword kata that demonstrated mastery over intermediate techniques.</p>
<p class="cnM3YWM4NjI2ZjY1YTQ2NTE5MmNhY2IxZDg0OTEwZTQ3">“It feels like yesterday I was watching you down there,” a gruff voice broke out.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjlmYTU1YTgzZDRhZDJiMDBiYWFhNzBhMDkyM2U2">Serena turned her head to see Grandmaster Shun settling down in the seat next to her.</p>
<p class="cnMwMTNiOTg3MGMyYzRmNGNiN2ZhNzk1YTAyZGQ2Y2Q3">“Feels like yesterday,” Serena agreed.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTgwNzM1ZGY3MDRjNDRhZGNjZmVkYTg3NmJmZjBm">“Hmm,” the grandmaster hummed. “The atmosphere is better this year. The students are more jovial.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODE0NmM4MWIyYTQyMjNhMWRhZDc3NDQ0ZDhjNjUz">“Jovial?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MTNkMGZkM2E4NDRmMjRiZDE4NTUzZDc1ZTU5OTMz">“For almost a decade, there was a spectre of death over this tournament,” the demon growled. “It was the last innocence they could experience before going to war. I would see it in their eyes. A fear they would never admit to...” He paused momentarily before adding, “Back then, I saw it in your eyes, too. Things are different now.” He raised a hand, gesturing to the students below. “With the war ending, I no longer see that fear. I doubt any of these graduates will see the kind of fighting you’ve been partial to.”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTRiNWNkM2I5NDQyOTM5NzM1MTU2NjE0NzE3NDI5">“I hope not,” Serena admitted. She’d seen enough horrors to destroy any romantic idea she might have previously held regarding <em>war</em>. Duty and honour meant she would see things through to the bitter end, but she could find no enjoyment in it. In fact, until Amelia appeared in her life, she’d started to wonder if she’d ever experience the feeling of innocent happiness again.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTBkMjFlYTVlNDQ3Zjk5YTM0MzQwYjg1MGMzMzJk">“What about my eyes?” she asked, turning her head to look at the grandmaster. “What do you see in them now?”</p>
<p class="cnMxM2QwMTY3NWQxODQ1MjhiNDQ0NjNlYWRiMzJjOGVl">The grandmaster locked his eyes with hers. After a few seconds, he said, “I see <em>growth</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTliODVlNTdlMTQ2MzViODAwNjBjMGI0ZWQ1ODEx">“Growth?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMjZlMTBlODM2ODQwYzFhMzQyY2FiODFiYWI0YjQx">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMWEyN2Q4ZjJjMzRmNmI4ODFkZTVmOTNmN2E0MTQy">“I see.” Serena turned her head, watching Mel continue her rapid practice. Then, she looked across the arena, to the seating on the other side, where the military scouts were making notes and pointing at particular students. “I remember being so desperate to win that year. To impress them. Now, I’m the one scouting for talent. The roles have switched in such a short period of time.”</p>
<p class="cnNhOWFiYTEzMGRiNjQ3ODE5N2VhODNjMTA4ZGI5N2Ew">“Of course they have,” the grandmaster said with a nod. “You’re a Speaker. It’s natural for you to rise through the ranks faster than others. You’ll be a commodore soon, won’t you?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NTg0YWRmNWVhMjQwZjlhOTFkMmIzN2NlZmNhYzE2">“You heard?”</p>
<p class="cnNmZjY3Y2NmZWNiNzQxMjViYmNhMGUxYWI1NGVkMTNl">“I heard. When’s the examination?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMWM1NDA1MTEwMTQ0MzM5ZTNjMTQ5NWJkZTI4Yjcw">“Just after graduation.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMjE1ODllZDQ1MDRhNjFhZGI1MmE2OTIyMjAzZThi">“How are you feeling about it?”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDNkOTg1Nzk5ZDQyN2I5MmE2M2JkNDhmNDc5MDcy">“I’m… trying not to think about it.”</p>
<p class="cnMyN2M4MjVlM2ZhZDRiYTE4MzBhYmNjNDljYmUxZjA5">“Ha!” the grandmaster scoffed. “From an officer cadet to commodore. We’ll be using you as an example in the lectures to come.” He leaned forward slightly to get a better look at Amelia. “What about you, Thornheart? Has the semester been… enlightening to you?”</p>
<p class="cnNiY2Q5ZTAzZDNmMjRmZmFiYThlOTY1OTg3NTM5ODdk">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded. “I’ve learned a lot! My magic control has improved, and more importantly, I finally reached red aura! I would love to stay, but I have obligations elsewhere!”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjk1YjA4Njk1NTQwZmNiMjliYzMwZjY3MDM4NjI3">“Ahem.” The grandmaster politely coughed in a manner that told Serena he very much <em>didn’t</em> want Amelia to stay and destroy more of the academy's infrastructure. “I’m glad to hear it. You were the first human guest instructor we’ve hosted for more than two centuries.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MzJiOWU1NDcxYzRlMGJhYzkxZTM0MzFjNzZkNDA0">“Oh?” Amelia’s eyes widened. “Who was the last one?”</p>
<p class="cnNhYWIzMTI3NGZhNzQzZjJiOWQ1ZGZiMjhhZWNmYTAw">“A swordmaster from the Sabanis Dominance. His name was Avyan Vinay.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NmQzMDllYzNiNzQzNzE5NzEwMzVlOTg1YjJjY2Qw">Amelia asked a few more questions, her enthusiasm for knowledge trapping the grandmaster until a whistle sounded. Below, there was a sudden flurry of activity as more than a hundred students lined up, bowing to the tournament organisers.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWFhZTQ3Mjc3ODRmYzc4ODlmY2FjOGVhZjRiYmZi">The first event was kata, and the three competition areas soon hosted a pair of competitors each. One of each pair would take a red piece of cloth, which they would tie to their red, orange, or (rarely) yellow belts. They would enter the mats, bow to each other, then to the organiser in front before making <em>heiko-dachi - </em>the ready stance. The organiser would select a shimokan kata from the first ten and command them to begin. The students would do their best, and their actions were closely watched by four more tournament referees, each sitting in one of the corners.</p>
<p class="cnMwOGNkZDA0MTJhMTRjODc5OTU4Y2RjNzI3NmExMjdk">Once both students had finished, the organiser would blow his whistle and they, along with the four referees, would raise either a white or red flag to determine the winner.</p>
<p class="cnM2MTBhNzVjNzUzMjQzYTg4MTY4MmIyYjBmNzg3Yjc4">It was that simple.</p>
<p class="cnM2YWJmMTI5NDNhNTQyNzVhZWRhZDRlODg1MTc1M2Qx">“How did you do when you took part?” Amelia asked quietly.</p>
<p class="cnNiMWEzYmJkY2RmODQ0ZjNhNTBkZGJiYzc4MjY2YzE1">“I came third,” Serena answered. “But my strength was always combat.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDA0NTE4MmVkZTRhNjdiYzI4YzBhMDNmNDVjZjM3">“Mmm, figures,” Amelia hummed. “Why are they only using red aura? To pace themselves?” She pointed down at one pair that were performing their kata with red aura, despite their orange belts indicating that they were capable of orange aura.</p>
<p class="cnM5MzEwYjE1NjFmZjRjNjlhNGYwM2FkMmU0MWViOWNk">“All events are done with only red aura,” Serena explained, her eyes flickering to the military headhunters across the arena. “At this level, control and mastery over the first aura is more than sufficient to determine a warrior's overall ability. But even so, after the kata, one-step, and sparring events, there will be an opportunity for them to demonstrate their higher auras punching and cutting metal.”</p>
<p class="cnNhOTQyOGNhZDEyZjQyMjY4ZWI5ODk0NjY5MDhlNDhk">“Is it the same for the mages?” Amelia asked. “Are they limited to first-circle magic?”</p>
<p class="cnNlYjJkYTMzNzljODRjNzlhNzdlYmMwYzQ0NGUyYmU5">“That’s right, for the same reason as well as to prevent the chance of a second-circle or higher spell accidentally hitting the crowd.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDE0NDBjMjM4YzQ2ZGM4ZDI0YTI3YTUxY2Y2ZjIy">“Can’t we ward the arena?” Amelia raised her arm, flexing a bicep. “I could do it!”</p>
<p class="cnNiZTkxZmY1ZWJkYzQyNDQ4ZjE3MGVjOWIzZjNlMmU3">“You could,” grumbled the grandmaster. “As could Lunaria, if she ever attended these tournaments. Very few mages could manage to cast an external ward for the length of time needed. The rarity of such a mage means the rules dictate the duels must be conducted with first-circle magic. Your presence doesn’t mean we go against <em>tradition</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNjdjZTZjMDhjYjQ2MmVhODBiMWM1ZjNhOWM5MGRj">“What about using the two Speaker training rooms?” Amelia asked, blinking innocently.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDRkMDY4MWMwMzRjZDBiNjliYjI5ZjRlOTBhMGU3">The grandmaster frowned. “They’re not big enough, and if they were…” His expression darkened. “One of them was destroyed by you and Lunaria, and the other was damaged by Highlord Driss and her… <em>enthusiasm</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MDM4YTNmMTliODRmM2I5Nzc1MzMwNmU1OTAyMDgw">“Oh…” Amelia audibly swallowed, turning and focusing on the matches below. “Oh, look! Mel’s up! Go-”</p>
<p class="cnNiMGExYzhiMWE0MDQzN2M4NmI5MDcxZmZhZDQ2OTNh">“Don’t cheer,” Serena interrupted. “It’s only allowed during the sparring event.”</p>
<p class="cnNjZjAwMjIzYmVlYjQwZDY5OTc5ZWQ2M2UzYjYxMzJj">Amelia quieted down while Mel finished her kata. She defeated her opponent with a passable performance, earning her three flags over two. Serena knew immediately she would be lucky to survive another round or two. Mel was a determined student, but her focus was on combat. She preferred to hone her instincts with sparring and viewed kata as akin to a warm-up.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTNhYmE1YWZmNTRmNTI4M2FiMjA5MTNhZjc1YTEw">This was different to her other disciples. Flakken performed better; his kata demonstrated explosive power but lacked enough flow. He moved through his kata like a shawa in a fengra shop; powerful and loud, somehow avoiding bringing everything crashing down.</p>
<p class="cnNhOTZjZmE3YzRiODQyNDA5Y2M4OWI4MTk3YWJkMzNm">The best were the Ainese twins, Ido and Arin Song. They were both in long after Mel and Flakken were eliminated. When one of them performed, it was as if their bubbly and cheerful personalities evaporated, replaced entirely with a focused and determined warrior who lived and breathed the teachings of Sangoism. Their katas were both explosive and elegant, with a flow that could only be achieved through thousands of hours of practice.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzQxZDBkNDg3MDQ0YmJiM2RlZjk0YWViYmE5NDk4">Serena only briefly covered katas in her sessions, but they must have been diligently training every day before and after. Once again, she was reminded of why she taught them. Not only were they some of the first demons in the academy to defend Amelia publicly, but they possessed tremendous mental strength that was a boon to anyone who might find themselves in a combat situation.</p>
<p class="cnNiOTEwNTliZDlmYzQyZjE4OGUzYTg3OTg5YTFjZWNm">The twins smashed through each round, often winning all five flags. They made it to the final eight where the format changed. Instead of their katas being dictated to them, and the voting done with flags, they would now choose their katas and they would be ranked on a numbering system from one to ten.</p><span class="cjM3NzVjZDU4MjFjZDRlODFhNWQzZDhlMDRkMDFmMDEw"><br/>The narrative has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the infringement.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNiNGMzN2E0ZGJlZTRlMGZhYjI2ODU3MTkxNmIxNGRh">The finals took place in the central competition area. The other areas were empty, and the hundreds of demons in attendance, students, instructors, and military scouts, would all be watching the finalists go up one by one to perform their katas.</p>
<p class="cnM2NWQ1YTVlNmEyYzQ3MTFhZmZiN2YwZDZiZTI1NWJj">Such attention would only annoy Serena now, but there was a time when a hundred pairs of eyes on her would cause a nervous sweat. As she watched the finalists, she could see that nervousness manifest. Some would slightly hesitate, or make minor mistakes they hadn’t before. Thankfully, the iron wills of the twins meant their performance didn’t suffer. More than a few instructors were nodding in approval. Serena could hear the hushed compliments around her.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDBiNmVlODkwODRmYWJiOGYwN2I0YmY1N2UxOTM3">“That was the best rendition of <em>Enpi</em> I’ve seen all year.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYWE2OTc5M2JiMTQ0ZjdhM2M5NWQ4MGE0OTA5Nzk2">“She invokes the right <em>spirit,</em> doesn’t she?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNzUxMWQ2NjJmZDRlOWNhNzg0NDAzZTU1MDE2ZjQ1">“Looks like they’re really fighting someone, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNWUzMGM4MWYxNDRjMzdhMTgwNWE2ZWY3MDllNTQ3">“They could become professional shimokan practitioners with talent like that,” the grandmaster suddenly growled. “Ido Song and Arin Song. You’ll be taking them, I presume?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMGFkN2M4OGViODQyODI5NDNjNjJkNTEzNmMyZDBm">“I’ll try,” Serena nodded.</p>
<p class="cnNjOTI4YjJhNDE1YzRiNDhiZGQwM2E5ZGZmMTYzNDYy">“Never forget what pathways of their lives you’ll be cutting off by binding them with a contract. Treat them with respect, Instructor Halen.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MWQ1NWQzOTg2MjRhY2E5OTZiZDE3MWE0MTgwMDMx">“I shall,” she whispered.</p>
<p class="cnMzODM4MWM2NWZmOTRjMWU4ZmZlNzVkODNhMTUxYTFm">The kata event ended, with Arin winning first place with her swordsmanship, while her brother, Ido, won second with his rendition of <em>Enpi</em>. Their faces were full of happy grins as they celebrated their victory, hugging each other and showing off their medals to their fellow students.</p>
<p class="cnM3ODUxNmUyZGU3ZTRkYTJiODc5MWY4OGFmNzVmNTZl">Next, the three competition areas were occupied as they moved onto one-step sparring. This was a structured form of combat. Each combatant would face each other, bow, and then the designated attacker would step back, announce their attack and then attempt to strike their opponent. If it were the unarmed variant, the attacker would punch to the head, then stomach, before switching to front and side kicks. The variant with swords would slash and stab at different angles and locations.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZWZiNDk1MzBiYTQ1MDQ4NTU0ZjRhYTFmMDQ4MDMx">The defender would block, dodge, or parry these attacks and then have the freedom to choose their counter-attack. After each attack, the pair would reset and move onto the next strike. After all attacks had been defended against, they would switch their role. Like with kata, there were five referees with flags. Each one looking for power, speed, and most importantly, control.</p>
<p class="cnNlYmE2ZjJmMmE1YTRjZTdhNDc3ZmZhYzY4ODA4NTkw">Ido and his sister did <em>okay</em>, and Mel did much better, reaching the finals, but it was Flakken who was in his element. His lack of flow didn’t hold him back, and his powerful counter-attacks stood out amongst everyone else. He ultimately came second, with Mel coming in at sixth place.</p>
<p class="cnM3MzYwYTNiZDFiNjQ1M2ZiNmZjZmUzY2NiZWEwYzM2">Flakken was a stoic individual, and he kept his emotions subdued most of the time. Even so, Serena could see him smiling as he examined his medal.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjE0Njk3ZGVkMTRjNDFiNGU3YzQ4ZWZkMWIzNWE5">“Hmm,” the grandmaster hummed. “The students who trained under the instructors taught by Highlord Driss are performing much better than their peers.” He turned slightly, looking at Serena. “Is that because you are passing on her teachings, or because the better instructors in this academy were inclined to participate in her training?”</p>
<p class="cnMyMWQ1YjJhMDZmNTQyYzJiZTQyZWUwMTNjZGYyMDQ4">“A bit of both,” Serena replied. “Highlord Driss reminded us of the value of intense and exhaustive training. I took some of the pressure she put upon us and replicated it in my sessions. It seems to have paid off.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZGY5NDI5ZTY0ZjRkMjQ5ZTI1MzRiOTM4ZDIxNjEx">To Serena, it was further validation of the teachings of Sangoism. Namely, the one describing how even the weak will become strong when the right pressures are applied. It was another way of saying that people will rise to the expectations you give them, something Serena had seen first-hand repeatedly in war.</p>
<p class="cnMxOWY5MGNmZTZjMDRiNjliN2VhZGEzMDMwMzRkNjY5">The penultimate event soon started. It was time for free sparring combat, both unarmed and armed.</p>
<p class="cnNkOGNkYmY5M2NlOTRlZjRhZmZiZTgwN2I4NDczMjM5">While four referees remained seated in the corners with their flags, this time the head referee would be on their feet, moving with the combatants to ensure there was no foul play. Each referee kept a whistle in their mouth, and the moment they saw an attack land, they would blow it and raise the appropriate flag to award either a full or half-point.</p>
<p class="cnMxMmU1Mzc0MDRjMjRiYWVhOTZhOTQ5MWQ5YWU3ZmRh">In a way, this was still controlled combat. The combatants would be reset every time one of them successfully made convincing enough contact. It was far from the terror of real combat, where a determined opponent would <em>keep attacking</em> the moment they saw the opportunity to kill you. Still, with red aura, it was the best method they could use to model a real duel without exposing the students to too much risk of injury.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGZmMzVhNTA5MzRmMjFhYzg5MDIxNDBkMjQ0MGZi">As the event continued, Serena was again reminded how dangerous it would be if they allowed the students to manifest their highest levels of aura. Even with red versus red, students were getting thrown across the mats from kicks that lacked control. On more than one occasion, matches had to be stopped due to concussions, especially when one combatant's aura faltered at the moment of impact. And that was only with red-aura-enhanced strikes breaking through! If an orange aura strike shattered a red aura, then the defender would be lucky to get away with only some fractured or broken bones.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjhjNWFiZWZhZTQ0ZjViZWE5MmEwNmRkZmIxNDVj">Unlike the previous events, cheering was allowed during the free sparring, and the students took advantage of that. It began as tepid cheers of encouragement, but as the sparring continued and the weaker students were eliminated, their hearts beat stronger and their cries became more energetic.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODMwMDBhZDJjMDQ3OWQ5NjcyYWExOTAwYTZkMWNk">“What are you doing!? Destroy her!”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGMxZGJiODYzNjRlZjE4ZjEwODUwYTU0YzljNzc0">“Break his horns!”</p>
<p class="cnNkYWFhNzExZTQ2NDQ2YjNiYjExMTdiZmMzNDk3N2Qw">“Go on, Mel!”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjVkNzQzNjFhNjQ5MDk4MWYwYTdmN2QzYjJjMDBm">“Stop bouncing around!”</p>
<p class="cnMxY2EzM2M3NDVjYTRiODM5YzE5OWVjM2FlZThlNTgx">“You can do it!” Amelia shouted, joining in with the chaos. “Woo, Mel!”</p>
<p class="cnM4ODcxNGRkZmNlODRjMzc5ODY5YWFkNDY1Yzc0YWVi">Encouraged by the shouts, Mel dove forward, executing a perfect <em>mawashi geri</em> that circled around her opponent’s raised arms before slicing down and striking their neck, earning her the winning point and advancing her to the finals.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzIyMjczZjg4NDQ0ODViZDc1NWIyNTVkZTUwYWY3">“Risky,” the grandmaster growled. “Reminds me of how you fought.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOTY4M2VlNGUxNjQ4NmE5MmM1MjE4NTY4ZTcyYmJk">“I’m more cautious these days,” Serena protested lightly.</p>
<p class="cnM0NmExZGYyYmE4MTQ4ZWI4M2RkZWQ3NDViMjA1YTgw">“Risky?” Amelia asked. “Why?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZjJkOGIyODZiYzRlZGU5YzdkOTIyOTM2MWFkNzFm">“Only for tournament fighting,” the grandmaster explained. He raised a finger, tapping the side of his neck so Amelia could see. “There’s a nerve that runs down the neck, connecting to the heart. It controls the rhythm of the heartbeat. Fifteen years ago, we had a tournament where one student executed a <em>mawashi geri</em>, and their big toe connected with their opponent’s neck in just the wrong way. Hit the nerve, and then…” The grandmaster clapped his hands, his face grimacing. “Dropped dead. Nothing we could do.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNGRiNzE0NjI4MjRlMDBhMDM3ODcxZTExMjFlODY1">“Oh!” Amelia brought her hand to her mouth. “Well, if that happens today, I’ll be here to heal them!” With that, Amelia turned towards the fighting below with newfound focus.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTIzZDNlMjNjMzQ0ZGI4YWM0NGFjZWE3OWIwMzMx">Luckily, for all involved, such an event didn’t happen, although Mel did cause more than a few nosebleeds. Her aggression and ability to flow her attacks together to give her opponent no breathing room meant she could punch above her aura, defeating even a yellow-belt, who had a far more refined red aura than she did.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjQzOTUwZTVmYTQ2MWNiMjBhMmEwMGU5ZDBjODEy">She eventually lost to another yellow-belt, coming third overall. Initially, she seemed annoyed at losing, but her expression quickly changed to satisfaction once she had the medal in hand. The free-sparring was the most prestigious event in the tournament and third place was a great start to her career.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTNlNTE1Zjk0ODRiNjVhZDUwM2YxYmVhNjNmOTM1">The military headhunters were nodding amongst themselves, making notes. Mel appeared to see this, but, if Serena wasn’t mistaken, she seemed more interested in glancing towards her and Amelia, only stopping when Amelia waved enthusiastically, causing the poor girl to blush awkwardly.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTgyMTBmYzg3MTRiZjBiYWRjNzcwYTgyOWFmZTA4">“She’s a real talent,” the grandmaster said. “I heard what happened in Kenhoro. Seems that <em>humbling</em> was what she needed to flower. Regardless, my brother must be doing something right to be attracting warriors like her.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNDgwYjkzNTg0NTQ3NmI5OTk2YjA2YjZjMjY0MGI3">Serena couldn’t do anything else but agree. She made a mental note to be prepared to give Mel a generous signing-on bonus. With her talent and ability, she’d be able to become a squad commander immediately and, of all the warriors she’d been training, Mel was the one she wanted the most for the <em>Vengeance’s</em> crew.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2RmYTY5NWE3MTRhYzU5MGJjN2Y0NTZkMDYzZWY1">With that thought in mind, the final event began. This was the chance for the students to demonstrate the upper bounds of their auras. Steel plates and rods were brought out, and the students would attempt to punch <em>through</em> the ever-thicker plates or cut through the ever-thicker rods.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzVmY2Q1OWUyODRhODY4MDdiZDA2ZmFjODgxYjg3">“It’s a traditional practice,” Serena explained to Amelia after she asked. “It’s meant to allow the students to expel all of their pent-up emotion during the tournament, and it also allows the military talent scouts a final opportunity to evaluate their capabilities.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOWRmY2NhZTYwOTRmYzViMTA3ZjEyYzgwODdmNjkz">The students were called up one by one. There wasn’t a tournament structure for the final event, and there were no medals or awards. For that reason, the atmosphere was casual and jovial as they began denting and in some cases, punching clean through the steel.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjM1ZjU3NTc5NjRlZjQ4OThjYzkzZDg1Njk0MDRl">The average red aura of a student could punch through a five-millimetre plate, or slice a ten-millimetre-thick steel rod. Seeing the performance below really highlighted how much Amelia’s wards enhanced Serena’s abilities. She’d already verified that <em>without</em> her aura, she could punch through a half-inch armour plate. With her red aura, that would double.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjEwZDI0YjgzZDRlMTFiNTdiNGI5YmQyZmNlODM4">Her girlfriend’s magic was truly incredible, wasn’t it?</p>
<p class="cnNmODRkYjEzNjU4ZDRkYjZhNWY0MmRjY2Q4Zjk4NWNj">Of her disciples, Flakken did the best. His orange aura made clean work of a fifteen-millimetre plate, and he was able to slice through a twenty-millimetre-thick steel rod. Mel and the twins did okay, but nothing exceptional. That was alright, though. They would have time to grow in the coming months and years.</p>
<p class="cnM5MmIyOGUxMjZiMDQ1MDE4M2ZmZjY1NjI5ODIyZWEz">With the final event finished, everyone lined up and made three final bows. One to the tournament organisers, one to each other, and a final one to the crowd watching them. They then cleared out, moving to the stands or elsewhere while the arena was changed to prepare for the magic events.</p>
<p class="cnMyNGZhNTg5NDAzZjRkNzliZGUxODA1ZmFiZWZmMjVi">“Oh, I see Hinako!” Amelia exclaimed. “I’m going to head down there and give some words of encouragement! See you soon!” With that, Amelia bounced away and was soon down below, chatting to the mages she’d been assisting over the last few months.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTlhOWQxM2Y2NTRhM2I4MjBhODhkYjUwZWVlYmI0">“She’s not suited for a life on a military vessel,” the grandmaster intoned quietly. “She’s still too naive about the reality of war.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMDRmZDVkMDdkNzQwMjZiMDdlNzE0MGUxOTM2NmQw">“Don’t mistake her optimism for naivety,” Serena replied. “She’s far more aware than she lets on. Amelia <em>chooses</em> to be cheerful in the face of uncertainty and conflict. That’s her strength.” She hesitated before adding, “She didn’t earn her Golden Horn from breaking down and panicking at the charred corpses.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMWQ3ZTdjMjM1MzQ3NTU5YmFlZjMxOTM2MjQ5MTE0">“...I suppose not.” The grandmaster scratched his nose. “I still don’t fully understand humans. Demons are so much easier to understand.”</p>
<p class="cnM2Zjg3NGIwNDJiODQyNzJhY2U4MjBiMGQzMDQyMmJk">“Tell me about it,” Serena muttered, prompting a chuckle from them both.</p>
<p class="cnM5MWY2NDcwNTk1NzQ4ZTU4ZTViOGI5YzljZTk3ZjI5">“Has knowing her made you change any opinions?” he asked, turning to look at her. “About their race?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDQ2MDYyNGE0ODQ4MjNiNmU1NjY4N2M3NDc0NWY0">“Not <em>change</em>, so much as <em>reinforce</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMmFiNmUzNDRjZjQ5ZWNiNjJlMzc2NTkwYmZiNWFk">“Such as?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZjM1MDI1NzQzYTQ4ODhhZDdjYzUzYTk3YTEyOThk">“That we’re more similar than we are different,” Serena uttered with a sense of finality. “Too many demons think they look weird because they don’t have horns, and because they look weird, demons think humans <em>think </em>differently. They don’t. Even if some…” She frowned, watching Amelia cheerfully motion-casting spells below. “Even if some are <em>extra weird</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZjAxNjc3ODA5MjQyMjlhZGQ2OWQxYWJmZWUzMTgz">The grandmaster smirked at her words, but otherwise said nothing.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTczYTdmNzRkZjRlNzY4MzExY2ZjMWEzNGI1ZmFh">They sat in silence until Amelia returned and the magic events began. Most of them followed a similar structure to the last warrior event, where there was no direct competition. The mages were called up and given a short time to demonstrate their aether control with first-circle spells.</p>
<p class="cnM4MGIzNGUwNDdkNDRlNmM5YjQ4Njg5NTU0NmVkNjdh">What each student did significantly varied. Some demonstrated their ability to conjure large columns of water, before freezing it into distinctive shapes. Others showed their control over earth and sand, creating impromptu defensive structures that could house several soldiers.</p>
<p class="cnNhMGViMmViMTFjNjQwNGI4ZmY5N2U2MTJmYzU1NTQ1">When Hinako stood up, she demonstrated her skill at quickly casting multiple spells, manifesting fireballs, rocks, and shards of ice in quick succession that she bombarded straw targets with. Daichi, the most talented mage of the upcoming graduates, did something similar, no doubt inspired by Amelia’s training. However, he carried out his demonstration while floating in the air, causing more than a few people to gasp.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWM1MGRmYzUwYjQ5NWRiN2ZiMjM0ZWFjOTNiODhi">Serena understood why. Normally, a mage could only slow their descent by pushing against the lumina four kilometres below. If they were extremely talented, some could glide or even fly by manipulating the wind at the same time. However, to truly levitate like Daichi was doing required a strong connection to the aetherfield itself. Usually, a mage would have to Speak the First-Word to manage that.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGZmZDc3OGEwYjQwNjBhMmVkYTdhM2U5ZTVhMTMy"><em>He’s the most powerful prospect</em>, Serena thought. <em>I must make him a good offer</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMyODgyM2ZkNjNkMjRhNzhiZGNhMmJiYTE1NTU1ZjZk">With the demonstrations over, they moved on to the duels. For safety, everyone but the referees and the combatants evacuated the arena floor, moving to the stands to watch. The mages were given strict instructions that all spellwork must be aimed towards or below the horizon, and they were only able to cast first-circle magic. The students were given time before to construct their wards, and combat would only begin when they were both ready.</p>
<p class="cnM2OTAyNDMzZjE4NzQyMDhhOGYzMTU1ZmZjODAwNjc4">Serena thought the duels would be relatively boring, simply a matter of who could be most aggressive and quickly overwhelm their opponent, but to her delight, there were layers of tactics that gave the event a high skill ceiling.</p>
<p class="cnNlZmQ3ZWVmYzY3YTRmMmE5ZjI2ZGNlOTk2OGRhMzc5">Mages were most vulnerable when they were concentrating on constructing their spell formations, but the students below were taking advantage of this by feinting their spellwork to invite an incoming attack, only to either dodge or dive behind a quickly constructed earthwork. Others would construct one formation, while cloaking a second formation behind it, forcing the opponent to either adapt in time or take a hit.</p>
<p class="cnMyOWNhMzRiOTFjNzRmNTliZThhYjAwZWE1NzMwM2I1">When Hinako was up, she’d become locked in a battle of attrition with her opponent. They were both crouched behind their respective earthworks, preparing their spells and then peeking up to take shots at each other. It reminded Serena of two snipers on the battlefield duelling. Just as the time limit was reaching its end, Hinako used her control of earth to burrow under her earthwork and pop up outside her opponent's vision, hitting him with a powerful strike that won her the round and advancing to the finals where she ended up fighting Daichi.</p>
<p class="cnM2NGU3YjBiNmM5YzQ4MDY4OWM0YmRlNDYwODc0NWIw">Despite her disadvantage against the third-circle mage, Hinako used every trick in the book, and seemingly invented new ones when she’d run out of ideas. At some moments, she seemed more like a warrior than a mage and near the end of the fight, she even tried to wrestle Daichi to the ground, only having to retreat when he manifested hellfire around his body.</p>
<p class="cnMxMmVlMzFkMmYzOTQzMmM4YmU3ZTFhZTU5MmMxNDcy">She ultimately lost, but received relatively high scores from the referees. Her variety of tactics and determination had partially compensated for the difference in power, earning her second place while Daichi took first.</p>
<p class="cnM3MzdjMzI2Yjg1ZTQ0MmJhOTZmMTQzYWE2YzMzOTdk">“She fights dirty,” the grandmaster said. “But it’s effective. She’ll go far.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NDA4MGEyMzRkYTRlODZiNzAzYTYyZmE3NjJkMTI0">“Mmm!” Amelia nodded. “I told her to fight like that!”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDRlMTY1ZDBiNDRlZGJiMGFhZjBhMzQ4MjFjYWZh">“You did?” Serena raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjIzODE5MzNiNjRlNjRhNGU0N2RlMWQxYTc5Mzhl">“Yeah,” Amelia grinned, flashing her a cheeky smile. “I told her to fight like you!”</p>
<p class="cnM3NTBmNjE0YTE5ZTRjNjM4N2FiYmRjMzMyOTZlOWY2">This idiot!</p>
<p class="cnM2NDAzNTNlOTVkMTQ2Yjk5ODhiMmIxZWU1ZDNhMTU4">The grandmaster coughed politely.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmQ4NTg4YWNmNDQyYjE4OThiMmZhMmZkNmIzZjZk">“Right,” Serena said, forcefully changing the subject. “I’m going to go down and make my offers.” She glanced at the military headhunters. “Early bird gets the worm, after all.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzk4MjZjYjk0YTQzNDI4MWYyNDk3NGNlOTc5Mjll">“Good luck!” Amelia chirped.</p>
<p class="cnM0MmJmNDZhZTU3ODQyNmU4M2MzY2EwOWQxYjJmNGEw">Resisting the urge to roll her eyes, Serena made her way through the stands, grabbing Mel, Flakken, and the twins. They headed down to the arena where the mages were congregating and grabbed Daichi and Hinako. With the students in tow, she found a quiet room and pulled each demon aside to talk to them individually.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDQ4MjZmYTVkYzQ1MzA4YmFhNzZkM2Q1ZDIyNDIx">She reintroduced herself as <em>Captain</em> Halen and explained that her purpose in joining the academy’s staff was to recruit for an elite team that would operate under her and from the <em>Vengeance</em>. She couldn’t tell them the true nature of the mission they would be undertaking, but highlighted that they would likely travel across the Empire, undertaking unconventional missions that would bring prestige to their names and houses, once their contract was finished.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2JmY2VkM2I1MjQxOWRhODVjZDZjY2JlOWIwMjY5">“Will Amelia be there?” Hinako asked.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGE2ZGY4YzZiMjRiN2NiM2YyYThkZmU1Nzk3MDRm">“Yes. Not as a member of the military, so neither you nor she will have the right to order each other. She’ll be travelling with us as a civilian advisor.” Serena thought for a moment before adding, “Should you accept, you’ll be able to continue your training under her.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDViYzAxNjIxODRjNzNiOTFiZjI0YmY2MmQwYWIx">“Then I accept,” Hinako said firmly, bowing deeply.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTZmOGVjODI0NTQ1NmZhYzUwNzE2ZTk2NGJmNTg4">Daichi took more convincing.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZGFlYTJmYTdkYTRhNjBhODM3MDJlZjdkODk1ODk5">“I don’t know if my family would agree to it,” he said with a frown. “House Ishitani is, uh…”</p>
<p class="cnNmZTdkOGM5ZDI5MjQyZDFhOTdhM2E0ZTgwNmVlNGM3">“Anti-human?” Serena finished. She’d read Aiden’s reports.</p>
<p class="cnMxY2M4MjEwYTVlMDQxMjM4OTVjMzYxNjU1MWI2ODNh">“My parents have always been political isolationists.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODhlOTAzMTk5NDQ3NTY4YWRkMjQ2ZDk4NmFhYzY2">“And you?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNTYwZDE5MWY4MjRkNGY4NzM4ZTIzZTVkNDU3OTE4">“I…”</p>
<p class="cnM4MWU0ZmU1NmJkMDRhZmRiNmE4OGIxMDdmZjZhMjU0">Serena let him ponder his words before pointing out. “You’ve been training under her for a while now.”</p>
<p class="cnNmODUwZThiY2VhNjQzYjQ5NDAyMjA0MTNhNjUxMzg2">“I know.”</p>
<p class="cnM0YjQzMDQwODVmNTQ4MGFhY2NjNzgyODllNWJkNjcw">“She’s a Lord-Prospect.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MDkzNjI0MjllYjQ5ZTdiNTM5MTUzNTBhNzdiZGI4">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NDZmODUzMGY3ZjRjNTY5OWFhZDBlMmYwYTgwZDNl">“And a Speaker.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZTFkYTM2OGM4NzQ1OWQ5ZTY0ZTUyZjRhMjJkZGQ5">“So?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMjYxMDg0MDRkYzRmMWM4MjRmOGE3MmY0NzZhZTNm">Daichi was quiet for a moment before saying in a low voice, “I must prioritise my family's concerns over…” He seemed to struggle to find his words.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTViYmU5OGIxMjQwM2VhZWM5NWM3MjI5Yjc2YWU5">“Does your family's concern weigh heavier than your obligation to the Empress? Are they more important than respecting the concept of Cascadian Lordship itself?” Serena could see he was close to agreeing, so she kept up the attack. “The war is ending, Student Ishitani. You won’t find any greater opportunities for prestige than what I offer. We won’t be sitting on our arses on <em>patrol</em>, I can tell you that. If the presence of Lord-Prospect Thornheart is such a problem, then simply don’t mention it to your family.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZWUxOTI2NGFhZDRiN2ZhMTE4NDNiMmY1YjFhNDNh">Seeing him raise his eyebrow at her, she continued. “She won’t <em>officially</em> be on the <em>Vengeance’s</em> manifest. As far as your parents will know, you’ll be taking a position under me, the <em>Hellfire Captain</em>.” As much as Serena didn’t appreciate her own nickname, she valued the prestige it brought.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzRlYjA5ZDI2YzRjYzI4NTRjNTc5NTM4MzRkMmYy">With a bit more prodding, Daichi agreed.</p>
<p class="cnNhMWUwYTM1MDdkMTQ0ZjFhYjNlM2QzYjk1MTM5OGRj">He was a close one, only just passing the background check. While his xenophobic family had almost eliminated him as a candidate, his personal growth under Amelia had given him the edge. He was simply too powerful to let go easily. As a third-circle mage, he would be the strongest mage on the <em>Vengeance</em> after Amelia herself. With Daichi’s agreement, Serena moved on to the warriors.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZThiOTU0YzI5OTQwODhhMGYxYTYzZjgwYjZkYzIw">Mel required no convincing.</p>
<p class="cnNlMTJmMzE1ODhjMzRmNWI5YmViYjVkYTFjMjkzMjg3">Ido and Arin needed a little prodding. Their main concern was being away from the East for too long, but they quickly relented after Serena convinced them that the <em>Vengeance</em> was their best pathway to moving up the ranks and perhaps even becoming Lord-Prospects.</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2IzNDZjZTg4ZjRhZjA4MWExY2ZlYWFhYTAyYjAw">She’d been hopeful she’d manage a clean sweep, but her hopes were dashed by the last person.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjQ4MWE5N2I2ZDQyN2M4Mzk1MTRjYmNiZDcwY2M1">“I apologise, Instructor Halen,” Flakken intoned with a bow. “My heart is set on the Northern army.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YWY5NWMwODkxYjRkYTRhMTZlODYxZjhhNzFjZjBk">Serena saw in his eyes that there was no convincing him.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjA5NDhiNjlmNDQ5ZDFiNjU2ZDZiY2NlZGMyMjI5">“Very well then,” she replied. “At least allow me to write you a letter of recommendation.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjdkMzk1YjEyYzQxMTQ4M2VlNjUwYmNlMTYxNDQz">“...It would be an honour. Thank you, Instructor Halen.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYjg0NDkwN2Q4NTRjMjViNjUwOWNmNzE0NTBlZDUy">After Flakken left, Serena sat in silence, pondering her options.</p>
<p class="cnNmNmY0YTdiZWRlNzRmN2ZhYTRkYTBlNDA2ZDhkZDJi">She’d been given permission to recruit six from the academy.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzFkNmRkZjU4ZjQ2MTU5NDZlYzBkODZkYmQ0NTc0">Daichi. Hinako. Mel. Ido. Arin.</p>
<p class="cnMyY2VjZWJhNjVmMTQyMTc4ZDkyNDI3YmQ4YTM3N2Vk">Five talented individuals, with the room for immense growth.</p>
<p class="cnMyMWE2NjJiMWQxMTQ4MGM4YzVkNmZlYTA5NDEyOGE2">Noburu. Seonmi.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2M3NDFmMmYyYjRjZGZhYWJlOWVhN2NiM2E4ODI4">Two cadets with little combat ability.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDk1OWFkMzVmOTQ0ZmU4ZDcxYzU3ZTgyN2Y1NDI4">She needed one more.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTI4NzNmYzkwMTRjYTA4OThlNDMyZTgyNzVkZjk3">Serena went over the names she and Aiden had prepared in this eventuality. It was a short list of warriors, promising students. The only problem was that Serena didn’t <em>know</em> them.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjY5NzY0MjcwYTRjZTY4ZWUxMTZhNzI2NzJhNzA4">Ideally, she’d want one more with <em>experience</em>. Someone who was open-minded, but had also served.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTFlMGNlOTU1YTRkYzliYTkwZjkzNzEwZDg4NjIy">Someone…</p>
<p class="cnMxNjg3N2UyNzg1NjRlMDg4NTJhNzMyNmEzOTVkOGQx">Ah, damn it.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGUzZDUyNjdiZjQ0YWZiOTg4N2JkZjJiOTI5OGM1">Serena sighed.</p>
<p class="cnNkYTBkMmFjNmExZDRlM2Y4N2M5NmRlZTJmYmFiNDg0">It would have to be that woman, wouldn’t it?</p>
