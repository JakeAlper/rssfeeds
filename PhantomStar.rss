<p class="cnM3MmQwNDgyOWQ3NjQzNjRhMjAyYzM3MDY4YmY1Yzli"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurtz StarSector</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmZlNGE4NWJhNDQwNjE4NTcwZWVjNzEwNTk5OGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kenish Duchy</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDc5YTQ3YWUyNTQ5MGFhYzcyZjdmNjc3NDFiNTc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">System 100212-B</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTEyMjM2NzgwNzQyYTQ5YWI2MjMwNjhhMzY1NWY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Scrap processing station UNK-L</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGY0MDgxMjFkYzQ3MzZiOWIyZjEwMmNjZWUxMTBj"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZGRiZDYwMWE3ZTRhMGI4ZDEwNGU4YzBjOGRhMzM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Watching star ships fly past the massive port windows was something that I once could only dream of, but now it was a daily occurrence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTYwMjI2OTAwMjQwY2RiNWJjY2YzNDBkYjZiNzMz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMTNkYWJiNzQ3NzRkZWM4ZTMwNzE2ZGUwNzcxZjY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a Zimmer Halogen. See the large bulb around the engine room in the back? That means it’s the B variant because it has the expanded engine room.” I chattered away as my Mother did her best to hum along at my words to show she was listening even if her interest in ships was nonexistent.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWIwMGQyMjliMDQ1ODFiOTgwZTZhZmMzNGEyYTQy"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYjUzZDY0N2ViZjQ0NDg4NWJhYzYzN2MyZjI1MjFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed weird to me that so many people living on a space station above a dump planet would basically just treat it as a diversion and nothing else.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDBkMjM1YWU3YTQwODFhMDcxZGI4NjQzZjQ0ODBh"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYzY3Y2U2ODY0NDQ0MmM5YzBkOWQ0ZTJkN2Q3Nzc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh look! That’s Dad!” I called out pointing and Mom looked up, her blue eyes shining as she smiled, her lips covered in purple lipstick, a weird fashion quirk in my eyes, stretched brightly. The tug shuttle went out and pushed the ship into the dock.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjAzYWE4ZGNmYTQ0YzhiYzM0OGI4ZDA0MjdiMGEz"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYWVhYjBlMTc3MzQ3MmQ5N2IyODNkOGJmZDk4MGYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">That ship was an older freighter, and it was beaten to hell. The Zimmer had towed it here. A pretty common occurrence. It was easy Cred. Haul some old scrap ship into a dump yard and we’d pay, and then scrap the thing for whatever we could get.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNThlOGExNDE1YTQxMWU5YTNiMmFkYjgyNWE4MGVk"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZGUxNjQ4YTAwNDRhODA5N2E4YjI0ZWY1OTRkZjFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Because that’s what my family did. We scrapped spaceships. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWViNmQxMTc4MTRhNDE5NGI1MzdhNzU5YWJlNjc3"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMWM1NDg0OWNjNTRkMmZiMjY1ZjIzZTVjODM3MWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">A great great great uncle had once done some amazing things for the Lord of the Duchy and had been rewarded with the right to set up a scrap yard.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGUwYzQzMGRjMDQzZmE4YTYyMjg3Y2ZhMzA0MGFh"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZTU2NTkyZWVlZTQ4OTRiZjY5N2I0ZDlmYWI3NTc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been running for over two hundred years now, and it had kept my entire extended family in enough Creds that we had become middle class.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGZiZWZiZDY3ZDQ3YzM5Y2ZjOTY0Yjk0NjQ4Nzc5"> </p>
<p class="cnMyN2U4MmJlYmQwYjQ2ZTdiYjhkMTJmZGM3ZWFjNTQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something not easy to do when the population of any star sector was in the trillions at least and most places were nearly feudal in how they treated people.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWNhY2EzOGRjMzQ0ZTI5OTA3OTU2OWY3NDM5ZjE0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNTY1ZGQ3NGFkYTQ2ZWRiMTM4YjE0ZWI4NGUxMjdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I was even more different than most. I had been reborn in the far and distant future, memories of a past life with a blue open sky had haunted me from the moment I had become aware I was alive.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTIwNzg0MWE1NDQwYTA5ZmZmYTY1NGIwNmU0MDY1"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZjM4ZjcxMzZlMjRhNjk4NmYzZGNkMDYwNjg1ZjYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Earth was so distant from here, you couldn’t even see the light of the Sun.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2JlMmE5NzM1YjQ0ZDc4MDViMmQzNzRhN2FmMDk3"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZTg0MmIzZGM0ODRkYTQ5ZDU1NWY0OGQyMWE5ODU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t even tell what the year was. Too much weird stuff had happened. Dark Ages. Calendar resets fighting other calendar resets. And after time people, at least my schooling programs, just didn’t really know. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmEyYWU2ZjJlNTRiNWQ4ZmRjOGMzOTI0MzU1YTIy"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYzJjNjE0NzllNDQyMThiMzk5OWViMjU2MGE1OGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. Will the ship scrap well?” Mom asked, and I nodded, trailing a hand through my blonde hair, my eyes searching the floating scrap heap. It would scrap very well. Everyone would be happy. I could feel my hands pressing against each other, a nervous habit I had picked up. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGQ4NDE4Y2NlYjQyY2NhYTg3NDNiNmIyYmQzMTli"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MzYyMDlmMzY3YjRjN2M5Njc1ZDAwOTIxMWJlNDBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to be out there too. Space was… Amazing. Special.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTg3OTljYzhjMzQ5MTQ5YzkyNWY3NWVmNzY4ZTRl"> </p>
<p class="cnMwOGVlNTRlZGU4NzQ4NDdhNWRiODQ5NTYwZGMxYTVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no regrets that I hadn’t set foot on a planet in this life. I had the soul of a spacer through and through. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTk5MjQwNmQ3ZjQ5NTZiNzg3ZGQxYzg1ZWMxMmFm"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYzgwYjM1NDJmZjRmYmQ4ODA0ZGE4YTM4MDY5YzQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I refocused on Dad’s tugship. The old freighter was pushed into the grapple arms of the station. Where it would be scanned, and scrappers would go through it. Some would be my cousins, but most were off station workers. Scrapping was good enough money for normal people, and despite the whole working in space, it was actually pretty safe compared to a lot of in ground jobs.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjRhMWM1OTM1MDQzZDViZTAyNzMyMGY3ZTE2YTk5"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYzg0YzYyMjdkMDQ0YzY5OTI2ODcyNjFmMmUzNzA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">You never had to worry about a station having a super hurricane, or a Mega Earthquake leveling continents in space. Not all terraforming was made equal after all.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGU3MzgwNTNiZDQ0MGFhYzk0MzcxZGE0ZWYyNzAy"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OGVjNGIyNTk0ZTQ5NWE4ZTc3MzNmNjIzYTI1NWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">And safety measures were very solid. Great Uncle Kyle was the current manager of the station and since so many family members worked here everything was reviewed constantly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWQ5ODAwNWNiZjQ5OWFhYWNhZDY0OWQxMDkxZDlk"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZGE5NDkzMDIzNzRkYmRhOGZiMWMzMDNiMDgwMmJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course that was for normal stuff. As Dad was pushing the freighter I felt it first. A rising of the hair on the back of my neck that had me jerk to my feet. Mom stopped and looked away from the Tab she was playing with as suddenly it sparked, and she nearly dropped it as she looked up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmMzYWJiZGMwMDQ4NjA5MGIzNjJjNzlmNGNmZDcx"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNTc2NTNjOWRkMjQ4N2ZiMTVlMjIxM2U2ZDNmYmMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Space, dark and shining with stars was suddenly cut through as a kaleidoscope of energy burst forth. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzFlZmRlNDA1NDQ2YjQ4YjBiYjAyNTE2YjNmNWJj"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNzU4YjY5MmNmMTQ1MzU5MTI2ZmMyNGUzZGZjMzky"><span style="font-weight: 400">A Warp exit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWQ4MDlkMDA2ODQ1ZDY4M2U3M2JhM2E2MTFmY2I3"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YTdmZTU3OTFmZDQ2NGY4ZjM5ODc2ZTI4MDE2YTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of static in space, a rioting flash as unreality touched reality, and suddenly empty space was filled with thousands of tons of ship!</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmVkYjI5M2FlNDRlNGQ4YjBhNGI3ZTkxMTIwNGRj"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZDcxM2U2OWYxMjQ3NjU4ODhiYjgwMWEyMzhjNWE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">No. It was more than that. That was a battleship!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTYxMzAwMjQ2NzQ0MjFiYmVlMGIwYWIwNmNmMGI1"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYTM2ODk4YTYxYTRlNTA4ZmJiNGM0MTI1YjNkY2Jk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I gasped. The clean lines of a military vessel were very different from the almost bulbous form of most civilian vessels. It was a shock to see. Especially since it was way way too close! Well within the safety distance of our station!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjYwMzNiYjliNjQzMmI5MTMyMzBhYTIyNGUwMjM5"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYTAzZjlkNTdlZjQ0OTViNDhlMzkxZDkwOTk4MmVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The lights inside shifted red, and the forcefields activated at full power. I could even see the light shimmer in space as our station's Shield Emitters activated trying to protect us against an attack.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzMyYzcyNzIzYTRmMmJhNjE1MWE2MmY0NTVjZmQy"> </p>
<p class="cnMzM2Y3OWI5MWU0YTQ1ZjhiOTAwZDc0Y2M0ZDAyZTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like many of the people on the station that had been looking out the windows. I started suiting up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2MxZDhiZWNlNDQ1MjhiNzAzMGY2NjA0OTI5Yjc3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYjZhYmRlMTk4NjQwMWZhYzJmMzZjYjNkMDE3ZWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally the heavy jumpsuit was only half on, the arms tied around my waist to keep me cooler, and to feel lighter, but I untied it in a rush and threw my arms inside. The suit was sealed up and I grabbed my gloves from my waist and threw my hands into them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTM2ZGQyM2M3YTRmMzhiYzJhOWExZjljNGM5ZTg1"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NWY5Nzg3NjM3MjQ0NjBhYjMzOWI4NjU5NDEzZTg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The seals instantly locked into place around my wrist and once everything was in place, the force field activated.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWRlOTYxZDMzODRiNGRiMWNmZjMzZTE4NWFlZTc0"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YzYwZmJmN2VjODRlOWE4MjRiM2FjOGNhNTY3MzE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I could jump into space without any fear as I stood right now. But I turned to Mom, who was unlike most of the staff wearing a more trendy fashionable outfit.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWRjYTI3ZDFiOTQzM2FhMWY3MTA4ZDk3YzYwYjgw"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYzVjNjQyMjQ3MzQzZDA4OGY1NGI3ZGEwNTNiNzhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on!” Mom called as she grabbed me and started rushing me away.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGYxM2EyNWFlODQwMTViZmRkNzk0YmE5NmZmNmIx"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYjg2YzU5ZmVkMjRjZTE5OGFkZDNjNDMzNDEyNThl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I wanted to keep looking because honestly if that ship was hostile getting into an eva suit, or into an armored room wasn’t going to help. But I did look and relax as Dad was already redocking with the station. Safe.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmJmYmZiMGU0ZDRmZDliZmRiMzlhNDM4N2M0ODUx"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMTQwZDg3ZDhlMDRjOGY4MDlkMDA5MzliMDRmNjJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTdlNWYzMWIxMDRjNjk4NGUyNWNiZWQ3ZTQxOTk1"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YjE0Njc3MmNlZDQ5NzI5MGEzZDkyY2ExMWYwNGNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dad!” I called out as I charged and jumped into his arms. He spun me around a bit which was doubly fun because gravity was low in the hallway section so we lifted off the air and spun around before landing gently.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjU1YjdlYjhjMTRiMzNhZjJkM2I4MTk0ODE2Y2U4"> </p>
<p class="cnNkM2ZjMzgzMmE2ODRjMjNhMzRiMDkwNTA1NGNjMjVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey! There’s my StarBurst.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re okay?” I asked in turn, looking him over. His own suit was well worn, but clean, and he looked fine, even if his forcefield was down.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjNmOTRjYTBhMTRiYWI5NTgwNmIyMTNlYTFkODI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah you saw that huh?” He asked, smiling and patted my head. “Bit closer than I’d ever like to be to a Battleship. Anyway, the ship that dropped off the freighter was the pirate responsible for attacking it. Turns out it wasn’t the first time they pulled this stunt. Considering everything. We get to scrap the freighter as the owners are gone, and we don’t have to pay the pirate so it’s a good day.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzI4NjBhOTM4MzQxMDA5YzM0ZTM2M2M1M2NlNjBk"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMmEwZDk2NTdhZDRmYzA4ZGJhMTcxZTVlMmQ4YWJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed in relief. That was good news. Nobility could have called us pirates as well and taken over the station, or just took the freighter entirely, or made us pay them for the mistake.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjdmOGJhZTQyYTQ4MTdiNTBmMTVlMWE4YmRhNWJh"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYTk1YTZjNThkZjQ3ODFiZThjYmFmZGM1Mzg1MDkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dear.” Dad called out as Mom pulled him into a hug and kiss. “Good news. I’ve been given scrap rights for the freighter. Gonna be busy for a few cycles, but-”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s amazing!” Mom called out happily, and I smiled along with her for different reasons.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzQwOTE1ZDY3ODQzNTY4YjlmNDg1YWRmMTQxMjVh"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZDE2NmI1YTFiNDQwMzY4MDI3NDU2MjEwODMzNTE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact was, Mom was… Well a credit digger I guess would be the right term? She loved my father of course. Truly. Yet she hadn’t married him for love, but to get herself out of poverty. It did lead to some awkward times when Mom thought Dad should push for more credits or work when it wasn’t culturally right.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDZkM2QwOTVmNjQyYjE5MDg5MjUxY2EwZTk3OWRl"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYmZhN2I2NmMwNzRmMWFiYTA3OGEwYjExYzBiZWI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Weird how despite having memories of a past life, I was more a child of the station than Mom who had been born in this time.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzJhOWI0Y2I2MjRmODk4MTgxYjQwZmMzODk3OThl"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NTBiZGY3YjFkZTQyYmY5YWFlNWE3MDVkNmE1ZTUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dad wasn't in the direct family of Uncle Kyle. So he and I would never own the station, or really make more than enough to live comfortably.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTNjNTZjMzAxMDRmNzg4YWQwZDJjMTg5YjRiMDRi"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YzkzMWZlOWU2MzRjMDhiNzdhOTBiOTk3NTdiZTFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was fine with that. I had my own desires, and it had nothing to do with staying on a scrap station my whole life, but Mom had… Ambitions.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDk4N2M2NTQwNzQyZjM5NDhhOTE5NTJlYzUzMWNk"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDMyZDg4ZjBlNDQ4NGI5OTI0NTJjOGUyZjY4Y2Mz"><span style="font-weight: 400">But sometimes it meant when Dad had to work more Mom took it as a positive.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzhkZjU5MjU2YzQ0ZDA4NWM3ZWVjOWQ0ZjAwMzM0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMGFhY2VlMmE1OTQyNGViMGJkZDQzOWRmMTcxMWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s awesome Dad! Can I see the engine room before you scrap it?” I asked, smiling already knowing the answer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDMxZjJhOGJlZTQxNjNhZGQ2YzUyMjQ2ODg4ZTY3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMTUwZTNiZjUxYTQxYTM4YjU1NjZlNmFjZWM0YTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not until you finish your Scrapper Exam.” He answered instantly. My fascination with ships was well known to every member of the station and nearly every traveler that stopped for a refill or anything else.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTVmMDI0ZWVmMjRkMDQ5NTdmNmM0OWEzYjI5MmYz"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNTFjZWFiNTE0ZDQxN2RiNTdmMjhkNTAxZmQ2NDRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed and nodded. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGJhNTI1MzA4YTQxMmI4ZmE1ODZiMzY2NDVhZTQ0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNzE4ZWVlY2UxMTQ3MmFiYjk1ZGI2ZTNkYTM1MDI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey StarBurst, why don’t you head to the hab, okay?” Dad asked, and I wrinkled my nose as I instantly knew what I was being shooed away from.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTA0NGJiNWZiYzRlNjlhYjVmNzVlMjJlNmRiOTI3"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OTZlMTUyMDI5NTQ1YjFhNDNlNGUxMWY3YjA1ZjMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gross! I’m running away! Just let me get my Tab!” I demanded giving both of my parents the stink eye as I knew they were about to have sex.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWQzZDgwYWFmNTQ4OWQ5MTAwNTQ1NDU3NWM1Zjg2"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ODZkYjM2MGQ5MDRkOTFhZGYxMzc0MmZhYzBmMzY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I headed into my room, which wasn’t very large. Most rooms were just a sleeping bed, which was actually an emergency pod as well. If you were sleeping and the station decompressed it would close down and keep you alive hopefully long enough for someone to save you.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2I3YWYyNjg2MzRhY2M4YTg0YWFlNzcwMjU2M2Ex"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YmRmYTJkZTFlNDQ5ZmU5NGMyZWJkMGY3YzkyMzEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hopefully.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzU0YmExMjBjODQ3MDdiNjYxMTE2ODI0YzBiYmEw"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YTRlMmQxMDJiZTQ2Yjk4YWMzYTViMTM5NDZlNzQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I grabbed my bag full of parts and my Tab, which was just a future tablet, and headed out once more giving my parents a disgusted look as I moved past them. The two were already close together and kissing, and like usual my face made Dad laugh as I left.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWFhMDFlZGE5NzRlMTBiYTA0YzBjN2RiNjU1ODkw"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYjI0YmU3NjExNDQwODg5NzZjNzAwNTMyNGJjNGFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I was outside, my face smoothed out. It honestly didn’t bother me that much, but it made my Dad laugh so it was one of our little jokes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTFlNjM2MzFlZjQ5MzFhMzQ0NWRiZDBlZmE5NDc4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YTlmNmY0OGJiMTRmN2I5NTIwZTg0NTJjMDY4NTFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurried down the dimly lit residential hall. The lighter gravity in the hallways meant I was practically bouncing as I made it to the elevator and slipped in. My feet touched the flooring solidly once I was inside the elevator the Gravity Panels set to a more normal Gravity. I hit the Hab button.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmFhYzZlMjZhODRjNTFhNGZmZDNmNjI4NjIxYTJk"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MDE5MDIyOTAxYzRmZTVhODdjN2U1NGI2OWZiYjU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I started digging through my bag. This was my work bag, tools and parts for my projects cluttered the inside. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2Y4ZjdjOTMzMzRkODJiNDhhODY2NGVjNTQ3YmQ5"> </p>
<p class="cnNjY2ZlZDNkOWY2YzRhMmU4ODI0OTRhMDEyMmRjYTlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had long ago realized that any hope of getting off station was going to take me actively making it happen.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjNkNGU2MWNiYjRiYzg4ODhiMmNiNjc5ZTdiMzEy"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMWJiZDg0ODMzODQzOTg4ZTc3NTEwY2Y0NDVlMTNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it wasn’t that I hated the station. I loved the rickety old place. It was just that I was in the future! People could explore the stars! I wanted to see it! Like Anakin Skywalker, I wanted to see them all!</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGM1MWYzODRiYjQ5Mzc4OTBlMzgwMjJiMWViOWNj"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZWE3YjZkN2VkOTRmYzRhN2QyMzE0NTA5OGU0NDIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The elevator opened into the Hab floor and I walked out into the noise of people.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWI1NzZhM2M1MDRiNWJiZDNiNjhjNjk4OWNiN2Nm"> </p>
<p class="cnM3M2Y0Y2VlZmJlNTRiOGVhM2I3MzBjOTdkNDdiYmNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Here at the top of the station was a massive park.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWQ2OTYxNzlkYjQ5OTE4MTUyM2EwNjJiNzRlNmNm"> </p>

<p class="cnNmNTg2MWJjODg5ZDRlYWNiN2FjNzQzMWJkZTA1Njkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I finished installing the interior hardware on the chassis, and the next important part. I had been planning on using this second grabber arm for my first Crabbit, but this way they’d both have an arm, and that was more useful than a more put together single Crabbit. Especially since I now had two gravity manipulating drones… Well I would once I started this one up.</span></p>

<p class="cnNjZTRkM2Y1ZTNlYTRjZjRhZTk3Nzc2ZDhlZWVjZDAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact was, I wasn’t exactly working with the best hardware, which meant the Crabbits were running off cleaning drones, and the like. It didn’t exactly make them smart, and I needed them to be smart.</span></p>

<p class="cnNjZTU1Y2RlMTAzMDRhNzY4N2Y1ZDZiZDgwMzI4M2M3"><span style="font-weight: 400">So I had taken an idea. Both Crabbits were running off hardware that was below what they each needed to operate optimally, but… What if they shared their hardware?</span></p>

<p class="cnNhYWUyM2U3YTEyZDQ3NzJhNzU3ZDgzOGRjYWI5MjFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crabbits each were formed from the same AI kernel, but what if I did even more Synchronization? </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWU0ZTRhZTYzZTQ0NTA4YmRhYjI1MTQ5YjlhMmU4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZjU0ODI3ZmZkYzQ1NThhY2U0MTk3YmVjZjAzYTIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The idea was really simple. The Crabbits would share their memories letting them learn faster than a lone AI could, and on top of that, they could share hardware, since the AI on each Drone wouldn’t override each other. They would be used to sharing digital space, and so could share their own selves with each other.</span></p>

<p class="cnM2MTdmODAwZWY2YTQyOTVhMTU0NDQyMGM1OTFjODA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">One Crabbit, many bodies. So if a Crabbit was doing a complex task, it could request hardware power from another and in essence, become smarter to handle the task better.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmZmJmZGFjYzZiYTQ3YmRiYTgxMTQ4NTEwNTVjZDA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the idea, and just like I had relied on the song that helped guide me as I built things, I had followed the songs guidance as I aimed to complete this upgrade as well.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlNTlmMjA1NzZhYjQ4OWZiMjc4NzE5NjdmN2Q3ZmY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">We were scrappers after all, but not everything that was handed to us was garbage. Quite a few ships were still capable just needing a refit or repairs.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjRhZmRiYTZlYjRjYjA4MWYzOWI4MjQ2ZjY4OGI5"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZDRiYTIwYzJmOTQ5MjZhOThlMWE5ODViY2MwMzEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s where the Scrap Field came in. We went through the ships and took out anything of value we wanted, and then pushed the ships into place. Tied them together, and left them to sit. Of course it was also a good place to store extra salvage that we found. Some of the old freighters were used to store spare parts so the Station didn’t end up filled with junk.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzQ2ZTQ1OWI1MDQxNGRhZWNmMTZhODgyYTAyNzM3"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OTc2NWVlMmVmZDRhNWE5NDAwYzhmMDRlMWMwM2Qz"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was another reason we didn’t crash them into the moon, or launch the junk ships into the sun.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODQxZTE5OTM5ZTQ1NThiOWQ5ZmZjNzdiMDk3Njky"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MGRlZGViOTNkODQ0ZDQ5ZTQxZDdmZGZiMzkwM2Nk"><span style="font-weight: 400">War was a real thing, and sometimes the Duchy needed ship hulls regardless of quality, to quickly put together more ships. Taking a freighter and refitting the engine and adding weapons was an effective method of adding a new patrol boat to a defense screen. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjE1YTVjZTU3MTQ1MzI4ZmM3YzVhMThlNTE5OGY3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZTUxZGI3YTRkNDQzM2Q5NmViNTE2NmQ2MWVkOWRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">And so we saved everything. Just letting them all float quietly above the small moon until it was needed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTViYzQ1ZDBkMDQyZTc5NDBkY2RjYTExM2EzYjgx"> </p>
<p class="cnNjM2IxMmE4NmJkMjQwYWY4OGY2YWY1MGY0M2E1OThm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well it wasn’t actually a moon exactly. A small Planetoid. Like Pluto back in Sol. Just a random space rock that UNK-L floated around.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTcxMjMxN2E1YTRmZDk5ZWVhNTFhYjZiNTQ4ZmY3"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZmRiNTc4NWI5YjRkYTE5MzFhNWJiYzU0MjM5MTVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">And this was the first time I was going to be allowed to go with!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzM2YjQ1Yzc2ZTRkNDJiZGQxYzZkOWVmNDk2YTJl"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMzY4YmFmNGIzMjQ3Nzc4NWU5YmFlNzk4YWQ0ZGI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">You’d be amazed at how many of the ships hadn’t been completely searched through before storing. There were times where the station would end up with dozens of new ships to scrap at the same time, and we simply didn’t have the manpower to handle them all. So they were stripped of the most important bits and pushed out to scrap through later.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjA3MzhkN2JlMzQ4ZjNhZDQyNmM5NWNjZTY3Mjg1"> </p>
<p class="cnNiODlhYjU5NGNhMTRmMjZhMTI4ZTFmYjk1NGU2NTQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s what Aunt Sheila did. She went out, usually by herself, and searched through the old derelicts for things we missed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzAxNTE0NDU5MjQxNGNhYTUwZDMzODcwZWYzZWVj"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNDhiOWQ3Y2FhZTRiODc5ZWVkZWJjZDY3M2NhMzZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">And now thanks to the Crabbit, and their sensors, I was allowed to come too!</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmViMTAwMzM1NjRjMWFhNGQwZjIzZDNkNGQ1NDdi"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NjRiM2ZlYzc4ZDQyYmM4NThjNGZiMjNlZGZkZjA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was staring enraptured as we flew under a large cargo freighter, the block shaped ship was all brute force and even floating quietly spoke of how it was made to force its way through whatever astral phenomenon there might be to get to its destination.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWUyMGYzMTUwYjRjYWM4OTAwYzFlZTI4NWFhNDZj"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNzc5NTNiNTk5ODQ5YTA4ODdkNGM1MWRjOGU0NmMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">There weren’t many ‘pretty’ ships in our field. We were out in the middle of nowhere after all. But that didn’t mean a few old pleasure craft weren't scattered here and there. The smooth curves of those ships were beautiful and caught the eye against all the brutal, or bulbous modification jobs of most of the ships.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDIyNGUzYWYxYzRkZWJiMmI3OWE5OTE3MTE4Zjky"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZWI2YzVkZjhkZjQ4NTBiNzZlYmNiMTE4ZTZlMTI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright kid.” Aunt Sheila said as she slowed. “Let’s get those scanners going. I want to make a haul today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded and turned to my Crabbit. “Go ahead and begin scanning. Work together.” I told them and both of them bobbed from my shoulders where they were grabbing onto my space Jumpsuit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzgzZWM0ZDk3NDQ4MDk5MDA1MWE0NWE5M2RhYzRj"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NTUxNDVkNTAxYTRlYzk5NGRkNjY4ZDdmOWJjM2E1"><span style="font-weight: 400">They started looking all around, and I pulled out my Tab to get a look at their returns.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGRlMTJhYjNjMzQ4ODJhN2Y0MzJkZDYwY2ZjNWIy"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYzIzYWVkNjM2MDRlMGE4OTQ3YTQyNmVhOGZkMTYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looks like that one has at least six Iris Drives.” I mentioned with a bit of fiddling my finger was in the right direction. An old Ecal Freighter from the looks of it. Tough as shit, and usually the sort of ship a family might take care of for centuries just keeping the maintenance going and the freighter moving.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTA5N2M2MTkwODQ4MjQ5YjQyMDU4ZDdlOGFmOTc1"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YTM5OTMzYzAzMTQ2NmFhZDQzMGRjNzE4MjMwNjc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">But this one had taken a nasty looking attack, a chunk of its side was just gone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTc3MzhmYjMxOTRiNmE4ZGE3MDgxM2M2YjljNGJk"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMTc5OGE0OWNmNTRiNzJiNGFmMTYyZmU2ZWY1OTVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it. Let’s go take a look.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDE3OTdjOWIxNTQ3ODA4YWE5NDc1YzgxNzJkNGNl"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZTQwZjUwNmE0ZTQ5ZDc4YjQ2YzNmZmE3ZDAxYTVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I grinned feeling the excitement, exploring ships was the best part of being a space brat, but exploring an old Space Hulk? That was something even more exciting! Loot! Salvage! Treasure!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjNkYjY4MjZjYTQ5NTJiMmVjOGQyMzc3ZWE3ZjQz"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NWVmMTZmMDZlYzRkNjQ4MTlhMDI1Yjg5ZGY2NDIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I giggled as we pulled up to the airlock and locked in, even though the ship wasn’t pressurized our airlock would depressurize us so we could get in.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjY4NTc0NGVhMzRlYWFhOWI5ZjBjNjhjYTcxODMy"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMzE0MmZkMGMzNTQyMDk5ZWRhYWUzMDI5MjA2NWRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Double check!” She ordered and I did, checking my helmet and getting green on my seals, and my oxygen supply.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWU3MTA0MzhjODRkODg4MTQ3NmQxNWZkMDcwMzFh"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMzEzZGI2NzRjODRjMGZiMmMxMjhkNDc2YTE0ODE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Radio check.*</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDJjZTYxNjE0NjRkYzBiOTBjNjdkYWFkZDg1ZGNl"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OGVjYTJkMmUzMzQwYTM5MDA5YzA4OTM3MjNiYjY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Loud and clear.* I confirmed and we moved, walking out to the back of the ship, we stepped into the airlock and it sucked the air out, storing it for later before the door to the ship opened and I got my first look inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTI1MWMxNDIzODRlZTJhNjVjZjg5NGEzZjdkZGMw"> </p>
<p class="cnMzY2E4ZmE3OTQ0NDQ5Yzg5MWMwMzU2MjcyY2ZjMDVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Old and broken down. I could see tire tracks on the floors where the station could have pushed salvage sleds out of the ship once they loaded them up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTQ1ZmU0NWEwNzQ0N2M4OTY2MWVmN2ExMjcxNDM2"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDVjNTI0Yzc2ZTQ0M2FhMmJiM2I0Zjc5MTg2NTFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Alright follow me.* Aunt Sheila said as she took a step and transitioned to a sort of floating motion as the gravity panels inside the ship were obviously offline. I moved to follow before grinning.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTQxNTZhODg0YTQ1MGNhNTVmZGNiNGY5NDI0MmJm"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDZlNjUxYWE4NTQ0M2M4ZjkwODhjMjEyNzc5Mzcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Give me something to step on.* I told my Crabbit, with a grin, and suddenly instead of floating in zero G, my feet touched the floor and I felt like I was in normal gravity.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzEzYjAzYjRjNzQ5MjM5ZWM0NDdhYzhkMWJlMjdl"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MjEyZDY2NmU3YjQ4MzNhNWYwN2Q2MGZlMDY0NzQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Smirking as I walked after my Aunt until I was beside her as she adjusted herself to grab a door further in and open it, she looked at me, and then looked back at the door controls before jerking back to me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDQ2OWRiMzk0NzRhYjRiZDcwNzhhOWM4ZDY1MDZi"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MDk0ZjdmN2MxYTQ0ZDg5YWY5MjJiOTUxMzFkN2E1"><span style="font-weight: 400">*What? I told you they have integrated gravity panels… Want one?* I offered and I could make out her visibly sighing before her radio activated.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWYxYTNiZjEwZjRjODY5NTYwZTQyYzVmMmI4N2Mz"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZTQ2MDk1M2Y4ZDQxODdhY2I5MDZlYmUzNjc1ODM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Yes… Brat.*</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM1NDI1NGE3Y2U5ZDRiNzA4YzRmY2FkNTk5MjI2M2I4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon you stupid thing!” I growled, loosening connectors that had been flash fried and then left to cool in the vacuum of space for a few decades wasn’t easy. The plug wasn’t moving and I finally gave up. *Crabby, give me a hand?*</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">*Yes! I’m here to help! Strong Strong Strong!* It repeated as my Crabbit floated over and grabbed the plug and instead of pure strength used that gravity panel inside to just push against it. I moved back and the plug popped, sending Crabbit jolting up but she inverted her Gravity and just spun for a few moments instead of smashing into the ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2ZmYzhmMjI1YjQwMWZhNmI3M2M2OTIwN2Y0NWUy"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNzIxMzVkZDY5NTRkMzRiODlkYjdiNzA5NjNiMzdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Wheeeee!*</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODI2ZmI3NDE4ZTRkNzlhMDE4MjgxMjRhOGI3MDA0"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMjRkMzYyMjUzMTRiZWI5MjBjYjNiMmI2ZDQzM2M2"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Okay you goof.* I said laughing as I reached up and grabbed her to stop her spinning. She could have stopped herself, but she was playing. *We’ll play after. But we need to get this console moved.*</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjg1M2M5Yzg3NjRlYjQ5YjI5MjRjNDhmYWM4MjQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Yes yes!* It cheered and I nodded. I had been working with Aunt Sheila for long enough she no longer hovered as I worked, and let me just explore and scrap whatever I wanted without issue.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDE2MTA1YzRkNDQzNDE5NzE1ZmY4NjM3YzZlY2U0"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MTdkODI1MWRmZDQ1MGJhYjBmM2JhOWJkY2M5ODc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact was? I loved it. Exploring old Spaceships was the coolest thing in the galaxy!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWRjZTgyYWQ0NTQ2OTQ4MjdhODFhODFkYjYyNzNj"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YTg4N2E0YzdjOTRlYmFiMjllZGNiYjNhY2I1NzJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I giggled as I walked back through the dead ship, my helm light the only thing lighting my way. *Hey you all. Once you are done with that. The console is ready to go too.* I called out, and my little gaggle of Crabbit cheered as they continued to leap frog a large chunk of the engine shielding out through the door. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGU0N2JlNmM0ODRhY2Y4NTM1NjEzMTkzM2Q0Mjc3"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNTdkZWI2YzFlNTRmYWM4NmMzNmQ5ZDY2MWQzMTFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to Aunt Sheila looking the other way, I had a dozen Crabbit now, and more in the works constantly. I was at the point where if I supplied the parts, I could basically go to sleep and there would be a new chassis to finish the AI install with in the morning, as they built themselves…</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTc2YTlmMjZlOTQzOTk4NDhjMzkzMTM2NTA2NDU1"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOWZhNmFkNmQ5ZDRmYTE5OTlmZTliZjBjOWQ4ZmU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">There might be a few laws that I was skirting close to breaking, but my Crabbit were completely safe. I wasn’t worried at all.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjM5MzI0ZGM4ZjRhYjU5ZGRiMDEwNjFkM2JhYzc4"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNDdhNzdlMzkxNzQ4NjFhMjRkNzdhNzMyNzlmMTgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Aunt Sheila. I’m finishing up here.* I called out over the radio as I watched the Crabbit move the large piece of equipment past me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjRmNzZjZGE1OTQ1YThhYmZmZGI2ZDE5ZjA1YWUw"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNjVhZDA2ODEyNjQyZTk5MDVkNTYzNjIxZTgxMmM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Brat. I’m not even halfway through. Double check again to make sure… But if you are done feel free to do what you want.*</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">*Thanks!* I confirmed having already done a second sweep. The Crabbit were far from infallible after all, their child like mentality sometimes got them distracted. Type 4 Sensors were extremely good, but there were always materials that interfered with sensor readings, so sometimes you just had to take things apart and use the Mk.1 Eyeball.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWVkZGZiMDY4NDRhMzBiODU3NjE0NTkxZmFkODEx"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NzE5OGQ0NjU1MTQ5MjZiM2Y5YTJlNzYzMjAyYmVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I floated back to the engine bay and stopped looking over where the Iris Drive used to stand.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGIxYThiMWVmMDRkOTI5MWEyZDg4YzVlNzUzYTJm"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOGU2YTAxMWJkMjRhYTFhZTUzY2RhODQ2NjBhMWNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was amazing. Even without the Drive the entire bay was beautiful in a way. Iris Drives were the piece of tech that allowed expansion into the Galaxy without limit. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTVmMmU4OTg3MzQwY2M4MzZlNjVmY2MxMmY3ZWY0"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMDQxNWYyZGI2NTRjNzY5NWZjNWNiYTFmNzY5MDNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinite power. It only had a certain output, but an Iris Drive as long as it wasn’t damaged could output power for Millennia without a hitch. They were both ubiquitous, and incredibly valuable. They came in all sorts of sizes, most people just called the smallest version of them Tiny Drives, and they were used in everything. Even if the smallest version were the easiest to produce, there was such a constant need from the ever expanding humanity that they were still valuable.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzY4YWU5ZjcxOTRiMjQ4ZDM5YTRiZDJhYTA2NzVh"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMDljMDNjZTE3NTQyZGVhZWE0YmY5MjBhMzUwZGZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">And the larger the drive the more difficult it was to make. The more expensive the shielding and power systems were needed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmY1YjVhOGM2MjQxYmJiZTAwZGEyZWQxY2VmODBl"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMTBkMTk4NTk3MTRmYzQ5YWQ2YTRjYzk1ZjA5OTE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I closed my eyes and I could see the engine room I was in at full power. I could see every piece of shielding, the plasma transfer conduits. It was a good engine. A bit old. It used some older parts, but it had been a good engine. Solid. The reason this ship died, hadn’t been because of engine failure. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGI1MmI4NWI5ZTQ2ZTJhMTczZDFkMTFiOTA1OWY5"> </p>
<p class="cnMzM2U3NTJlOGU4NzQ0ZTQ5NWRiNjJjZmNjYzIxODRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Crew death. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook it off. Opened my eyes and saw the room as it was, scrapped to the copper in the walls if the ship had such a low quality material.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmY0OGQ1ZjUzMjRlODI4ZjdmZmZjNmIwZjhhZjAz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOWViNWQ4NGZiYjRkYTA5NjM4NjgzMmIzZDI0YWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a lot of good engineering in this room, but nothing of value. Better tricks of the trade and better results were possible, shown in a dozen other ships nearby. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTI5M2NjMzEzNzQxOGJiZDZhZjY5NzZhOWIyNTVk"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNDg5ZTRmMTUzNzQ0ODBhZGQxMzFiNDk1MjE0NjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly, I was putting together in my head all the best tricks I’ve seen. I wasn’t the only techie in the Galaxy. Wasn’t the only weirdo that wanted to live in an engine bay and tinker with the engine until it purred just right.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTRmYmJjNGU3YTQwNzhhOWEwOGJhNWE1ZTYwYTcz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNjBlODMyYmEzZDQyMjVhNzU3ZjA1NjE4ZmVjNmFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">But I could learn from them. Even if the engine was gone. The parts taken, or the engine destroyed by directed energy projection from a pirate, the ship still sang to me what it had been, every piece of hull remembered what it had been like to fly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjQwYTk1MmZhZTRkYTBiODE0NDFhNTBjMTBiMTlk"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZjI2NTcxY2ZmYzRiMWM4ZWQ3YmFiZDQyN2Y1NGNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hummed along with the song of this ship. Smiling at the feeling it brought. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmJmOTc4Mzk2YTQwNmE5N2IxZmI2MTAyYWIxNTQw"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZGRhZGI4NWQwNjQyY2I5MWM3YTZjMzU5Yjg0YWNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was getting closer to my goal. I nodded satisfied and turned around. Heading out through a second airlock letting the Crabbit continue to load up the shuttle to head back to the Station. I stepped out into nothing. Spacewalks were surprisingly peaceful when you still had Gravity. I bounced a few times casually drifting towards the binding cable.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTkxMTk4MDBlYjQ4MjE4NGZmZTY5YWMwMTNlNGJi"> </p>
<p class="cnM0Yjk0NmM5NDY3YzQ1Y2E4YjQ0YWZmZTQzMWQ4YjRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was basically a cable with a built in gravity plate. It would hold whatever it was attached to, securely, keeping it from jostling around. It meant even when the Scrap Field was hit by micro meteors, or whatever, the ships weren't smashing into each other. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmYxNTUxOGQ4YzQyNDdhMjIwNzFlMjFjZjA5Nzc4"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYWZiOTcyYjc1NjQ2MGRiY2ZkNjIwZTdmZjcxZGRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were all connected but not always well. Making the entire field a sort of spider's web of connected ships.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGVkYmZhZWY3ZjQ0NTM5YzJkNTUxMjg5YThmMWE5"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZjhjZjYxZGJkODRkNThiNjkxOWNlOTAwMzMwOTJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I leapt and my Crabbit assisted me as I landed on the cable I wanted and I let the Gravity shift, letting Crabbit basically ‘drop’ me away from the ship I was just on towards another. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTdjMTUzYTFjMzQyOWNiYzQ0NDhhMWQ5YjA3Zjdm"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYzVmZjlmNmM4NzRkN2FiNzY5YmYyZTE5NDllYWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was exhilarating. Falling forever and ever until I landed softly on the hull of the next ship.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTQ0NmJmMWM1NTQ0OTM4ZTU0OTQ2OGE3NTQyY2Zk"> </p>
<p class="cnM1Y2I1MzFhNTQ4NzQ1OTdhNTUwNGY4OGJmYjQ5YmY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I moved on, three more drops and I was there.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzBjOTQxN2Y0OTRlNWI5ZjJhYjc4OWU2YmQ5NDli"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMzVlNmE4Zjk2NDQ5YTZiZWNiMTYyMGJhMjlhZTZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an old Super Freighter. It had been completely gutted so long ago there wasn’t anything of value inside, and the ship itself was pretty useless to anyone. So I had basically started using it to store all the extra scrap I had found that I was going to keep.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDVkM2FhY2UyMzQyMzhiYTNhMWE0YzViYTk4Nzhk"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYzVhODUyMmExNTQ4NTZiMTU3MzQ5ZjViZjQ5MjI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Aunt Sheila had been annoyed, but had agreed that if I was scrapping I should get some rewards as well.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTU0N2RhYTRhNTQ2NzFiNDJiMTU5NmVkNGRiNmQ3"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNWJhMDc3YmM2YzQwZWY4N2JjZTM0YWZmZTU5MWIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">It helped that the Crabbit had sped up her job by an incredible amount, and we were clearing ships just the two of us faster than ever before.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlYTlhMWRjMDZiNTQ2OWY4MGFiNTA1NmQ0OTA5YzBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurried past once he was gone.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNmMjAzZjZkY2FkMTQ4MzFiMmY4OGJiMmU0NjA3Yjg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the most difficult moment of my life. Line after line was typed in, questions that I just had to get right answered one after another, and then finally it popped up a message.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGM2ODc4ODQyYTRlN2Q4Y2JiMWYzNjQxZjBiMzlk"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYjU5Njc4ZGNjYzQ2ZDJiMGM5OTQ3MGNlODgwODRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exam done.” I said and looked at the tester. Uncle Milbert. A very exacting man that always frowned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGJhZDNlODU4ZDRjZjg5NjViZmQ3NTRmZWJiZDdj"> </p>
<p class="cnM4Y2RlNmY5ZGNhYjQyNjVhNGViYzE5NzJhN2U0MThj"><span style="font-weight: 400">He nodded and in seconds my results were posted.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzllMWE1MWY5MjQ1ZmFhM2RhZTk3N2RmNjA0Yzli"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ODAxM2I5YWQ2ZjQxZTA4YmIzYzE3OWExZjZmNmNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I slumped in relief.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTJkMjQxZTJiNTQzOGI4YWFiOWE0YTNiMTFiMWJj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NjA0NjkyZmI0NTRiOGNhN2Y3YTg5NThlMmJlMjNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s close, but a pass. Work on your policy knowledge.” He said and I nodded, rising up and running out of the room before he could say anything more. My desire to escape from that room was too great to wait any longer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDc4ZWY1NzQ4YjQzNzJhMmYxN2U1ZGRhYTdlMzI0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOTNiYWFkZWM2ZTQzYmQ5NTkzNTgwMjM0ODRkZjE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was finally free. Taking the Exam a year early had been a surprise to everyone, but by taking it now, I’d still have a few years before anyone expected much from me, and I could continue to do my work with Aunt Sheila even if Ops wanted to put me with another work segment.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmRkY2JjNmZmNDRkOThhN2YzMDMxOWI5OGQzYTZm"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNTU2YWM2MTM1ODQ5M2Y4YTg1MjdmYjI1ZjQxZTIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a few years before everyone would be expecting me to lock my job in, and start working full time.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjY0NTNkOTlkMTRhZWFhZjBmZjUwNThiNzI2NTA4"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZTE5ODQ4MzAxNzRhZDY5NGFlOTA5NGM0MmM2MGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">So let’s say two years to get everything ready… That would be cutting it close.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWFkYjE0NmUxZDQwMzY5YTFkMDY0MzdiYzQxNWZl"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MzIxZGJlZDk1NzQzNjY5Mzg0Y2Q5ZmNmZjE5M2Vh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurried away. Running through corridors and bouncing off the walls in the low gravity segments. Finally I made it. A shuttle was waiting for me. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDIzNjFkM2Y2ZTRlNjQ5Y2Q4NzRjN2IzNjMwZmRl"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re early.” Aunt Sheila said from just outside as she was loading up a few tools. I quickly rushed and started helping.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDAxM2UzNTUzNDQ5MTlhOGMyNTU2MzkzOWYzNjM0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NTMzYTc1MTNjYzRhNjhhNGM5NzYzZWRhMjdmNDJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Finished early. Passed.” I confirmed breathlessly, as I wiped my messy hair out of my eyes quickly throwing it back into a messy bun that it had escaped from as I ran.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You did?” She asked, shocked. “What’d you score?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Passed with a green mark in everything, except for Policy. Got a yellow.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh.” She chuckled at that. “I scored a yellow in Policy too.” She admitted and I smiled, but I was also lifting her equipment and practically hauling it into the shuttle. “Okay what has got into you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a project that I put on the back burner until the Exam is done. It’s why I took it early. Now I have all the time I need to finish it!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWExOGQ2NGNiOTQ0NWJhYmNiMjM4YjZmZTYyMGRl"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNWVjYTAwMzk3OTQ4NTg5ZDgwOGJkOTBlOTQ2MjEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm.” She muttered but in the end my exuberance, and perfect acquiescence to her orders while working meant she just shrugged me off. Once more, me being a bit odd came in clutch!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjExMjg2NTZlOTRmYTI4MWE4ZTFkOGMxYzI1N2Nm"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNjAyZDcyYTUwZTRiNWVhMjYyYjdmY2RjMDEzNzM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">We set off, and I pulled out my Tab contacting the Crabbit Collective on my space base to start preparing for my arrival. It had been over a month since I’d been able to come do some work longer than a short stop here and there to make sure the Crabbits weren’t starting a Cargonia cult or something.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTk3YjYyNWZhMzRjY2M4NDRmMGI0MGM1NDI2ZmY5"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZWFkMzBmZWE5YjRhNTViN2Y5YjM4ZjIzZDM5ZTg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I split off from Aunt Sheila with a happy wave as I jumped out of the shuttle and into space. For a moment I was floating peacefully, then my shoulder Crabbit maneuvered me to the freighter I had taken over.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGNjOTg4MjdiYjQ4OTI4NjljN2Y4NWUyMDhkNzE5"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYTIyZDI5ZmE4NDQwYjJiYjAwYTc5YTVjYzczY2E4"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Crazy brat!* Aunt Sheila called after me over the radio, but it wasn’t the first time I had done so, or the first time she had done it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjk2M2Q1MDllZjRhMjBiZTExYWQwZTVhMTAxOTc4"> </p>
<p class="cnNlOGFjYzExMjk3NzQ4YmQ5YmRhYzg2NzI0ZDE3ZDRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Entering into the freighter's cargo space I pulled off my helmet with a gasp and looked around.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTJiZjdhNzY4ZDQwMjhiNGJjZWY0OTA1NjVlYjZk"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMTY1YzIzMGVlMTQyOTRiMWY3ZmJhYzliZjY1ZDI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a lot of scrap gathered inside. Pieces of valuable bits that I would need that would save me time trying to make them when it came to putting together a ship. Of course the most important part was still hanging in zero gravity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTExZjU3MWY5NDRjMjU5MDVkODMzNmUwODY1NjY3"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZWI3MjQ1ZDNkOTQ2Mjc5MzIyZGUxNTAyMmUyNDI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked over to the Diamond Drive, noticing the slots for the Iris Drives were still empty. Today.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWNlYmEyZGYxNDQyNDI4ZmFiNTUxOWY1YzM2OTQ2"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MjVkYmM3OWY4ZjQzYmJhM2VjNGU0OGZhY2QwMGJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Today was the time. Aunt Sheila would be working on a new cargo ship that had been dropped off, and it would be on the other side of the Scrap Field. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjQ5YjQ2YTBjZjQzOWM4MzdmY2NjMmExMzE4ZDhk"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MjBjYTNkYmZlYjRhMjM5ZjBjYTA1ZWJlMWU2OTc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impossible.” A voice denied, and then dozens more joined in chanting the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTY3ZGMxN2EyODQ3MTk4Njg2MThlOWZlNTg0ZDhm"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYWE2NmQxY2U5NTQ1ZTQ4MTI4MjViNWFhMjQ1OGJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’ll work.” I told them. The song hitting a rising crescendo as I said it. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlODcyZGNjYTAwNDQ2Mzg5Y2QyMzY5MjY5NDJiMDRl"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYjIyNWE4OGQ3MjRhMWJiODYyMTVmNzJhNmFkOGI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impossible! Simulation shows a 100% chance for complex deconstruction!” The Crabbits argued, and I turned because that voice was different from normal, she had sounded intelligent, a lot of them must be synced up for that level of sentience.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmJkZjA4NjdhNjRhNTA5YjgxNTEwM2ZiNzBhODZi"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYTAzYjczNTkwMTQ1M2Q5Y2FjMDUwZTU5Mjc5MDkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s because your simulations can only simulate what it already knows. We’ll gather data today proving it’ll work and you can update your simulations.” I told the one that was arguing with me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impossible!” It denied waving its arms at me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWU5ZWFlNTlmMTQ5ZGViMmUwMGM4ODBmYzA5ZDc0"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impossible!” All the rest then chanted at me, and I laughed. They weren’t wrong. And their tugging at my pants to pull me away from the empty drive was cute. They were protective of me. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2YyMDc1YTRhZjQ1OWI4YjhlZmRiYWJiYTI3OTg3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNjMwYjcxZDhmNTQyZDJhNjdjNzg1Y2RhODI0MTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. We’ll take it out past the other side of the moon, and activate it.” I told them. Mostly because I didn’t want anyone to see the explosion if it did go up. “I’ll be behind the edge of the planetoid.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impossible! Resource loss! Catastrophic! More Crabbit instead!” They argued with me, and I laughed. Sure, having seven more Crabbit would be useful…</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTY5NzNmMGM3ZDQ3MmZiZDc1MjQ5MDAwN2ZhZTlh"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZjkyYTEzZWY4YjQ2ZDFiZDMxZDExN2YwODJiZDkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around the bay. I was up to what? Twenty? Or more. Sometimes new ones popped up randomly. The only reason I knew that, was the random blue paint most of them now had. I had started giving them a little blue to offset the metallic chrome, but then they started trying to paint each other. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDdkMzhhYzc1YjRjZjg5MTVjMGE3YjQ2NTZmNmQz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkODUzZGYzM2NiNDQzMjM5NmU3MzRlMTAyNDNlNjNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was messy but cute. And I kept seeing new paint jobs.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjdmNGNmOTY3YjQzYmM5NTI5ZDMzZTdjZjhlYzhk"> </p>
<p class="cnMxN2Q1YjlkZDdmYjRhOGM4ZTU0YTg4Mzc3OTA1ZTg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sneaky buggers were definitely making more of themselves. But this wasn’t something I was going to put off anymore. “This is it, girls. This engine works and so everything we’ve done has a purpose, or it fails, and my life as a scrapper on this station is locked in forever. I won’t fail. I can’t.” I told them firmly. Trying to Impress how serious this was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2NhMDM4OWMwNzRlZTU4Zjk1OTdkNjEwMWVkY2Nh"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZTExNjg3NjdjZDQ2NmE4Nzk3OWQ1MDBjNjRhMmE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">They drooped around me which was cute, but eventually I had my crew on my side. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDU4YjgzMWIxMjQ1MDFhNWRmNjYxZWJlZDUwYmMx"> </p>
<p class="cnMyODkxZjU5NTZjYzQ4NDY4YTZkZjUwMWQ1OWY3MDZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath. “Let’s get it moving girls.” And I went and grabbed my helmet. We had gotten the Hangar doors working, including the force field that kept the oxygen in. I did a quick double check, everything was still working, and then started the doors. The massive cargo bay doors slowly opened up, and I stood there looking out over the light of the sun glinting off the ship hulls and took in the impossible sight.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjZmZDE5YWQwMjQ2OWQ4YzcxZmIzOTBjMzg3NWI0"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNmQ2ODJmYmZhNjQ3YTZiZmY3Yjk0Njk2NDQzYWRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">This life had been all about impossible things. What was one more?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjhmYjZhNzVmODQ0NDM4MDMxNWY1ZTNlZTBlYWI5"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NWE4NjVjMjI3NDQ4NWJiNWMzYjMyZjVmZmI3OTRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crabbit worked together picking up the Diamond Drive. The Iris Drives, and the console and scanner systems. We were doing this right. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGFmNzEwMjhkOTRmYjlhNmMxMmU4ZDk0ZTI1NWFl"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NDRlMmRmMWJiMDRmNDM5ZjFjNzkzZjVlZGQwZTZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting a full reading on the diamond drive as it first activated would be important.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDc4MTEzM2ZkZTQxZjNhMTVhMGY0ODQwNThiM2Fi"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NTEwNjljYmNiMTRlNWM4NzdmZjQwNmQ2NDVmMmZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t need a shuttle with so many Crabbits. My little group all jumped off into space along with our equipment and started flying. They already knew where to go and carried me along with them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjQzNGUzNzllZDRkYmY4YjRiOTBiOGQ1MGNmMzgy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZjhiZjk2ZmIzYzRlODJhOWQ0MTM1YmVlMGFkYTg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was dropped off on the nose of an old Freighter on the edge of the Scrap Field. I took a moment to adjust my boots on the cold hull plates and looked out away from the scrap field into the distant space that would be where we finally tested something that would change my life, one way or another.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2FlYmU0YTVkNTRjOTNiNzA1ZGRiZjA5ZjczYzIy"> </p>
<p class="cnNhODVkNjE2MmU3YzRmYWQ5ZDRkOTBmODg1MjA5N2Ew"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not on. Not on.” I turned and noticed the Crabbit were poking at the monitoring equipment we had brought and I smiled. They must not have much hardware space themselves right now. I walked over and started setting up what used to be a ship station, and started turning it all on.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmN2UwYmUyYjY2MjRmMTI5N2ZkZWRhNDA1OWU4YzJk"> </p>
<p class="cnNiM2YxYWI5YzgzZTRiNDA5YzE3YWZkNTUxZDhmZTMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly my little cloud of Crabbits and equipment flew off into space. Farther and farther. The Crabbit were using their gravity Panels at their maximum, synced together to get some serious distance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWJmNjhhNWU3YzRjNDI5NWQzZjQ4NjgzZjIzODMw"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNThhYWY1MmUwYjQxOTZhZmUwMzdlZGQyODMxOWE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once everything was stable, I connected and was looking through one of the Crabbit’s eyes as they reached an acceptable safe distance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDQxYWVmODM4YjQ4MjNiZmEzYmVmZTQ4MGFhY2Mx"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYTc5Zjk4OTU5NDRlMGI4ODBlMzUyMWI1YzVlZDEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Impossible!* They argued once again and I laughed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTI4NTcwODFiZTRhODFiOTc1YjNmODkwN2UzNWQ4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NzcxZmIwMjliMDQ4Zjc5YTljNzg4NWM5NzZmZGY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Only if we don’t do it. Everything is impossible until someone does it. Finish preparations.* I said and the Crabbit jumped into action. Twenty minutes later I was looking at the Diamond Drive with seven Iris Drives floating around it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmI0YTdkYzg5YjRlNGRiYjdjZGNiNWQzOGU5ZTdk"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MzY2ZGRlNzg3MTQzYjI5MWRmYTZiOTk4YTM4Yjc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Insert Core.* I called out, and the Crabbit maneuvered the first Small Iris Drive into position. The Diamond Drive was in two halves, and as the core was put into position the two halves were maneuvered closed with the gravity control. Slowly it sort of twisted shut.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2FlNTY5YTY0MDRkZTZhMzg0NWFlMDE5MTZlODFj"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MTI4YjhmOTIwNTQyYzA4ZjQ5Y2MyMDBiZGRhNDg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Insert Secondary Array Drives.* I called out, and Six more Iris Drives were gently brought closer, each with a Crabbit moving it so there would be no bumping anything. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWRkYzQwNjNjNDQwNDdhNjU3N2I5MDM4NmFkZjI2"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OGIzNTMyY2I4NDRjODM4NDRiZGZhZThlZTI2ODRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The measurements for the Diamond Drive were… Exact. Incredibly so and I didn’t want to fail because an Iris Drive was shoved in a bit too roughly and set the measurements off.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjYyMTE2NzE3ZTQzYmM4MDIwYmJjNTY1Y2I4MjZh"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OGNhZGIyMDYwZTRjNjg5Zjc1ODI0NjMwNjQ4Zjdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Each one was brought into the square insert at the corner of the Octahedron and Inserted. Clamps securing the drives into perfect position and slowly the gravity controls of the Crabbit were released until it was floating safely.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTQzM2RhMDFkMjRkYzY4N2M2MGQ0NmUzNzE1ODVk"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZWJkMGQ2YTk0MTRiOThhN2U0YmMxMGViNmYwZTY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything was still locked down. So as far as the Iris Drives were concerned they weren’t connected to anything…</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWM3MjQ1ZWU4ZTQ1Zjg5NjhlYmUyZDBmYjQzYWYw"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOTRkNzc5YjlkNTRhMzdiZjcxYzEzNDJlOGI4MWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODRlYTRkMjE5YTQ2NmM5MWM1NzBkNWMwYmFlMWY0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMDI2ZTFlYzBmMzQzNjViN2VjMzI4Mjc1M2YzZDM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Achieve safe distance.* I demanded and they all buzzed away leaving a single device behind that would be our close up eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2VjZWJkNTQyMzQ4MWJiNTMzZDNmYTI0YjI0ZWNk"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NzcwODNmZjE4OTQ2NDRiMzU1NGEwOTBlYjVhYmY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Every scanner I had was then pointed right at the Diamond Drive. I waited impatiently, but I wouldn’t risk my Crabbit for nothing. Especially since I would already be down a lot of Iris Drives, and time if this blew up.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGZlMjgzMTA5ZDRjYzU4NzdiMzcyODc4OWE1ODRk"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZTA2YzViZmI1OTRkMTM4YjNmNjkzZWZiM2RjNmU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Only when I got confirmation from every drone that they were at a safe distance did I start.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTc1YzZiODcxMzRiMDdhOTVlM2YzNTgwMWE5MzRk"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZDU2MDJhZDYxMDQ2NzhhNWRiYWY1YTc5ZWE4NzQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Be-* I nearly choked on my spit. My hands felt wet in my gloves. I swallowed and started again. *Begin preliminary activation.* I called, and despite whispers of *Impossible!* Still coming through my comms which did make me want to laugh. My crew did their job. I watched as the Diamond Drive began glowing as power was drawn from the Iris Drives warp rift. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDRkOWZkODYxYTRmMTU5MmQ4MmMxMTEwYTNlMDQw"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZWUwMzVjZWExNTRkYzU5YTk1MGFjZjVkOWMzZmUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was still blocked though… I took a breath. Felt the fear and anxiety, and exhaled it all. It was useless, I didn’t need it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmQzZjNkMmUxNDQ0NzJiM2Q2ZDAzNDk4MzQzNTVl"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNWQ2OWI1M2VjMDQ2OWY5MGM1MThmNDI5NDE1ZWQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Begin array activation!* I called out confidently, and the song around me reached an almost overwhelming Crescendo!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjM5MGM4OGE5YzQ3YTliZjU3MTM2MTUwMmFiYTdh"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMTRkYjA2MGMyNTQyOWNiMTBhYWM1YjEyMmQ5ZWQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I winced as suddenly that beautiful blue light of the Iris Drives shifted, as the Iris drives all started taking in power, something they weren’t supposed to! Yet, instead of exploding, as the rifts overloaded, they sent the power through the shunts into another and another, and then back into the Core.</span></p><span class="cmFjOWI0ODk0NjdlZDQxYzA5OTk4MGQ1ZjE0NzA5ODQ3"><br/>Unlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkYmRiNDk3M2MzNjQ1ZjlhMjkzYjdhZmI5ZWU4OTY0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMzRiMTY0MmYwYjQ4Y2ZiZjEwNmUwMjJiZWIzYWE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then instead of exploding like what should have happened. Instead of causing a Warp Rift that would grow beyond containment, and then fail, somehow the energy flowing back into the Core pushed back the rifts expansion.

<p class="cnM1NGM3ZGI2NjFkNDQyZDU5ZTA2YzU0MWFiNTdlM2U5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn’t been sure the best way to build them, but eventually I had decided to use a bunch of the older parts. Honestly they were basically just the older Crabbit builds, from before I had the ability to use nanopaste to print whatever I wanted with nanomachines. So each of them would be unique looking, which was actually a benefit since no one would mistake them for my own Crabbits.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzNlY2MwYTBjNTRkNTU4ZjBmYWRhMDMxNjhlOTlk"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNTZkMjYxMWNhZDQwNDJhNGQ2M2NhMzM4MWE2NWNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">And unlike what I just said, they were already long done. Setting the Crabbits to the task meant they all got completed while I slept.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODhiNDNjOTljYzRjYTE4ZjgwNWFjM2NjYzJjOWY5"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZWUyNGRkZTQ2NzRkM2Y5MWQ0MWE1MzU0MTc3ZDNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thirty drones was a lot, but not for a group of fabrication drones. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDk4YjBlOTBjNzRjMDhhZmM1OTQxZjhiOWI4ZDM4"> </p>
<p class="cnNhOWI4MTY3ZGU1ZjRhYmVhZjlkYWY4YmUzN2Y1OWUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">No, the big reason I was heading out to my lab was because of what was inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTM0ZDQwZmQ2ZTQwNWQ4ZDVjMmViMzIzMzVmZDVi"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YWYyZjZhZmQ1YjRhMjFhYjZiNDI3MWJjODM5Njgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The old super freighter was more than large enough for me to stick at least most of the hull I had chosen inside so I could work on it undercover.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Yjg2NzZlYWMyNjRiZTVhZDA1NWFiZmUwZTQyYjBj"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNjhkYjk3ZjkwMTQyOTg4NjhiY2JlN2QyYTBiYjlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Because the hull I had been given was an extra large freighter ship. The sort of rust bucket that was made to just blow through anything in its path and as such had way more material than a normal ship.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGZjZmViMjQ4MTQ3NjFhMzEzMjQ1ZDgzMGFkMWE4"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNDU0Mzc0MDdlZDQ5NTZhMGMxNjg3YmNmNjIzMWQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I would need every piece of it too. I had slowly come to a decision on the ship size I wanted, and the fact was I was going a bit over what I probably should. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmU0N2UwZjdkMjQ3ODM4N2Y2ZDUzN2QxNmFiZGRl"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMzZjNjNiMzc1ZjRjODZiOWEwMDQyYTliMDc1Njgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">When I started designing the ship adding in everything I would want including my creature comforts, it had been… A bit too big.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWUxOGExNzIwMjQxNzc5OWZmZDRjOTE1NTY3NjM5"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMzM4ZTcxNzRiNTRjNDM4MTA0MmM0MWZjYmViNjM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was frustrating to have solved the problem but still ended up lacking that perfect system.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDQ1NTQ2ZGU5MTQwNzJhOWY4ODU2NGM4OWQ0ZWZl"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMTM2ZTNmZTcwNTRiN2JhNGI2NDRmMDU5NzU3Yjgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">So I had taken my completed ship design, and started cutting. It hurt every time, but what I could do was make the ship capable of reattaching the missing pieces.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Nzg3Y2MxODAzYTRiMjY4OTUzNzI0ODI2ZTBmZGVl"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MjY1N2M1YmNlNjQ5ZWE5OTMwOGNmNDkyMzg1YjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I cut most of the crew's comforts. My own living space was still there, but no crew space. The weapons were mostly cut. Then because I simply had to remove mass and size, I had to cut two of the four engine nacelles. Instead of a quad engine design it would be a dual engine, and…</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDFkNDNiYTNhNjQ1MDY4MzE4OGU4NzBkZTNmMDM3"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDk5OWE0YTFjZjQ2NzdiZjNhMmFiMTU5NTcxYzBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It would work, until I could get a bigger Drive.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWY4YzA2NjY5ZTQ1YTA4NmJjZWRiOWE0OWVhODky"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZmIxOWExNTNiYTRjNTM4ZDcwNjE2MmVjZGI4NGY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I left all the connections in the design, and with my Nanopaste I’d be capable of connecting the completed modules later without any issue.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmQ5NjU5ZmRkZDQ0MDdhZmRjMGFhZjQ4YjNiOGU2"> </p>
<p class="cnM0N2Y3OTNjOWMxNDQ4Y2E4YmMxOTk2MTMxYTkzZGU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it left me with some issues because my dream boat wasn’t going to be as heavily armed as I had planned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWJkOTE1MjE4YzRhMmRhNzE4M2NkYmY5ODFhZTNm"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMjgwZDAyZjZjNDRiNjU5ZTk0OGM2NWY3YTE0ZTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The plan was to have a cannon at the front, but nearly everything else? Side Repeaters for point defense, and fighter screening? Gone. Expanding missile racks? Gone. Laser broadsides? Gone. It hurt my soul to have so few weapons, but I would just have to make up for it in other ways.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDYwYzgyOTEwMjQyZmI5ZjQ4OTM1NWMwZTQ4MDgy"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNDNhOTUxODUyODRkNDlhMmM4YmQ2NTk5NzA4ZGEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Armor? A composite ablative mix that I had tinkered with, that would be completely unusable without Nanopaste repairs. It would have been astronomically expensive for a normal ship to deal with, as the armor ablates in a way that repair would have to be done with fully repairing the entire section of armor. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjYzZjBlYWQzMDQwOTM5ODUxNmMyMWU5OTZjNjE1"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYmU0ZGFlODM5YzRjMWRiMmJmYWI3OWY4ZGMxM2Ni"><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I could produce my own nanopaste, which could simply repair the ablated sections of plates, repairs were easy. I would be much tougher than an equally armored ship.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTljNGJkMzUzNDRhODRhM2NiYjk4MmI0NDJiYjlj"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZTZiMzQzZGY0MTQ4YzQ5N2E2MDE4MzBmOTZhMzYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then there was the superstructure itself. I was literally using the nanomachines to break down the materials of the freighter and then remake the material from the atomic level to what I needed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDljODZhYjRkNDQ4YmM5OTFjN2RhOGI2N2I4MmQy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNzgyNTNlYmQ4ZDQzMjdhYmM0NzEzYThiZjFjODJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took scrap Klint Metal, already a future alloy and reprocessed it, Altering it into as strong a variation of the metal that I could make.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTM1OTRhMjNkNzQwZTlhM2U1Yjk1MzIyOTZmNmY3"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YWYzNWE2OGZlNTQ0YTdhYmQzMDAxMjQ2MTc3OGE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly material science was pretty crazy already so I wasn’t even doing anything out of the ordinary with the material itself, but taking the time to configure it from an atomic level through the entire superstructure was definitely a high end manufacturing method. Luckily I had been creating nanopaste continuously, so I had a lot of gray goo already prepared, more than enough to keep the process going quickly as the nanopaste was able to make more of itself faster than I was using it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzNlMDY2MWI4NTRiNDRiZTM0Y2RiN2MyNDBlMTMy"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMTNjYmI3NWQ0ZTRkMmM5YTczMzVlNGM5ODFiYTc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then of course like the armor. I’d be able to replace damage incredibly fast by just throwing nanopaste onto the damaged sections.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTU3ZDFkMDgwZDRhNzFiYWI3Y2QzY2I0ODRlNmY3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMzM1M2FjYjU0MzRiNTk4YWI2MDdmNDkzYjhkNDY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">But if my ship only had armor then what was the point? </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmQ2YzBiNjhmZTQ5MmY5M2NiZmQ2ODI3ODFkNTYw"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OGZmNDEwN2QxNjQ1N2RiNzJjNjg1NTNmNGZhMGUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">By this point I had arrived, and I flew the shuttle right under the massive freighter that I already had sticking nose first into the even larger freighter.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWRlYjU3OGI2NzQ2NzI4Mjk5NjJhMzQyZDE4MjQz"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MzZjMTQzMmE4OTRmYzdiZGJmMjBhNzY2OWFmYjdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Within a few moments I touched down, and then stepped out. “Go ahead and grab everything inside!” I yelled to the Crabbits, who cheered at my words and floated over to start grabbing the extra parts I had gotten from Aunt Sheila.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzAxZjM1YjY1ZTQwN2U5ZGU2NTYzMGE2Yjg2Y2M1"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZmI1Mzk0ZDQwMjRhMWNhNWU5OTY5NjJmNTBkYjE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">There were just… Too many issues.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDg1ZDAzYTY1MjQwODU4M2NiYWQ0MzhkZmRkOTUy"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZTVhNzEwYTQ2ODRlNjdhZmVjN2Q3YzUxMTlmZmI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I really needed a pretty solid shield emitter system to make use of the extra energy I’d have from my Diamond Drive, and a few back up emitters in case the mains went down was pretty standard ship design, but if I had medium Iris Drive’s in a Diamond Drive… I’d be able to support double, or triple full shields arrays.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjAyZTQ4NmE5YTQ3OGNiZTA2YjIzYjk3Mjk2MjQy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMGI5YzJlOGY2OTQ2Yjc5MWNjMTc0MWNmMTFiYzAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which I didn’t have, nor did I even really have the emitters. Those were valuable and quickly stripped off the hulls as soon as they arrived. I’d only found a few hidden in storage rooms on some of the old ships from time to time.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGI0MThjMzViZTRkYWJhNGU1ZDQxMTFkOTlmNTAz"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZGQwOWJjZTc3ZjQxOTBhYWY0YTY1N2RjN2NhYzVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">But then came the biggest issue. I needed a stick. Something that would truly turn my somewhat anemic ship into a danger that shouldn’t be poked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTkxMmJkMDY3YjQxMzU4ZmIzYmE4MDc5ZWNkZTVi"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YTc5NGM3ODU2NTRmNDBhNTk0YjZmM2NlOTk4ZTE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">It couldn’t be weapons. I didn’t have the power for anything crazy. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiODY4ZGFhMGJhOTRjMjJiZGEzNDc3NTkxYWQ2OGM4"> </p>
<p class="cnNhN2QyMTAwMGRlOTQwNmZiOWRjYThlNzQ0NWM2NDQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">It couldn’t be shields. Those had the same issues. Couldn’t be speed. With only two nacelles the ship would be sluggish, even with all the cutting for a modular ship design, it wouldn’t be good. I needed something else.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWQyZGQ4M2JmZDRlN2NiYjQwNzUwZjE0YmM2M2Uz"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNWUzYTQ4ZTI1ZTRmMmI4YzdmMDQ4NjZhMzRhYzNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sensors would be solid but unremarkable. Unfortunately to get up to a Type 5 sensor system I’d need parts I just didn’t have the time to make, even with nanite forging.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTMwNzlhNTgzMDQyNWI5NmIyYjk1ZGQxNmIwYWE0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMjBiZTQwZjYxZDQ0ZDI5NDVkNDMyNDJiMjZjMmZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">If a ship couldn’t hit hard. Or endure, or go fast what could it do?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzcyNWEwYWFiZjQ2MWZiMzMwZDlkNmI0ZjllNTY3"> </p>
<p class="cnNjY2Y1OWVjNDM1NTQ3MGFhNjM0M2JlNmQyMWNiMzJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The question taunted me as I kicked my feet. I was hanging my feet out of the force field just staring into the vastness of space letting my legs feel zero G while the rest of me still stayed in the atmosphere of the hangar. I liked doing this. The weird dichotomy of gravity and not gravity. Of being in space.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDA1NDMxOTQwMTQwN2U5ZDcxMjFmZDQyNjllYmZl"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MmQzZGYyYjJmMTQ3NTA4MTlmMjQ4NzEzMTNjZmI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">God I loved space. I ran my gloved hands through my messy hair and played with the small ponytail I had been growing. Mom hated it, as it wasn’t a popular style. I mostly just didn’t care and kept forgetting to get it cut since I was so busy. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmI3NzA0NGNjZDQ0NmNhODM2YzdiYTk4MzcwMDc3"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZjA5OTg5MzU5YTRhMTc4ZWRhM2Q2NDAzMjJlNmUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">What could I do?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGY5ZGM3YzZhYTQ3YzZhOGQxMjkwMDhhMzI3M2M2"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNjU2OGZiOTFjOTRmNzRiYjU2NmRlZjk0Y2M2MmVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d have my Crabbits. Which could be useful boarding troops, but I’d have to weaponize them a bit more first, and that still asked me to be able to board an enemy ship. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDI4NjM3NTdhNzRmNjNhMTdiN2QyMTcxMTI2MTE2"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYTM2Yzc4NTliYTRkZWU4Y2Y4Mzg4NzJhMjAwNWE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crabbit working around me reminded me I had a time limit. The moment they started forming the superstructure any hope I’d have of changing things would extend any timeframe out obscenely. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTM1ZTI2YTc3YjQwMDhhZTAzY2M5NWExOWQ3Y2Zh"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZjAzOTBmMWYxMTRmNWI5NjUxZTdhNDJkNmI0ZjM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I needed to figure something out. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzBlNGM1MjEyNzRmYTliYWU3YjE1OTNiN2QyZmRi"> </p>
<p class="cnMwOTJmOTFkNzgzYzQwYmM4MmM5ODdjNDM1MzRkMjM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">If you can’t hit hard. If you can’t take a hit. If you can’t outrun them… “Missiles?” I wondered. I could do a missile massacre… But no, that was stupid. That would be a one time thing and then I’d be out of material, and that was assuming I even had missiles in the first place. I already said I didn’t have materials for extra weapons. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiODllZjFhNzBhMTQ4MzRiM2UwZDA1ZmQ3Mzc4ZDVj"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NzdmMGFjNTFmOTQ1NGRiYjRjNDVkZDUzMmQ3Mjk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d already likely need to secretly gobble up any extra scrap I could get my hands on without anyone noticing to finish the-</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDY1YmU3NmIzNDQ2NjZhZGFmMzgxNGYzNGNmNDg2"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YWRjMjM5MjkyYjQxZGM4YWYzYTU1YzQxY2I1MDkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I rose up, nearly stumbled at the mix of Gravity and not as I got my feet under me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTYyZTYxNzg5ODRlYWE4N2UyNGQ5OTc4Yzc1NjA2"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NjgwZjNkNmY3YjQzZDdiYWUxMzE4NTQ4NDdmNDcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Could I? The Diamond Drive was already something different. I probably could.</span></p>

<p class="cnM2YjhkNTIwNGJmOTRhZGNiNmUzNTNiYmE0ZGFlMWI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked slowly back towards all my equipment, hearing the sound of everything singing pleasantly around me.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3Zjc5YTkxZjlkZDRmNDg5YjZhYzZmOTQ4MTNiNWU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kathy! There you are!” I looked up from my Tab, food half in my mouth and blinked at the familiar figures. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDVkZDM0Yzk0ODRmOWM4ZmYxM2RkNjUzZTU3Y2Fl"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YWNmYTIwMWYwNDQzNDliZTc0ZmZjY2EyZjAzYWUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t quite say anything but I threw up a hand in hello and started chewing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGQ4ZmE5ZDg0NDQxOWViNWQ4N2Q5MzBiZWQxZTM3"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYmI2MTIxOTNmZDQxZmU5ZWM0ZTU0OTQyMDgwNjM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve been gone so much! I haven’t seen you for more than a second or two in forever!” Marie whined and I just shrugged as I continued swallowing,</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGYwNzI0MGIyMDRlYmI4MGMwMTg1MWNhNTFkMzhh"> </p>
<p class="cnMxY2U1ZmZkMzY3MTQzMjhhM2Y3ZjE1OWEzNGZmMTMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Marie, don’t whine. You know what Mom says. Kat, nice to see you not running for the black.” Heather said. She was Marie’s younger sister. A few years younger than me, but nice enough. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTQ3NmNiNmRlNjRiZTc5MmVhNjFjMGJhNTk4ZTRi"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MjcwMjI1YzgzMjQxYjk4NDg5NDE1Mzc5ZDBlYWY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You too.” I said and then blinked because that was dumb. Ugh. I had done the you too thing. Uuuuu.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDU2OTQ3OTE3YjRmZjg5MzcwOTNmMDljNjAwYWVm"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYWNmYTAwZmY0YTRlOGJiZmY0ZDZkMDMyNjQ3MmJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So tell me something Kat, because I heard a rumor.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t do it. Simon is lying, a lying liar who lies.” I denied instantly and completely truthfully.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWUxMWEwMjljMjRkODk4ZDA4ZjhhYmRlMmY5YjE0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MTVmNTViMTlmNzRhNDViNjI3MzFjZTU4ZjkyMzA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moving on from whatever that is, we’ll talk about that later.” Heather said then pointed at me. “You have a ship?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDZlNmIxZTc1MjRhNzdhNjhmYzc1MzEyZDk2ZDRk"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNmRjMmUyM2EwMDQzODQ4YTZhY2RlYjdkYjRjMmM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have an old super structure that has absolutely zero internals… Who squealed?” I demanded looking between the two and then when neither responded I stood up. Time to loom.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODhjZmQ2MDRkMTRlNDFhMTdjNGQzZDZmMTljMDFk"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MDhmZmQ0NTk0ODQ3N2Q4NmIwYjk3NzJjYzViY2Nm"><span style="font-weight: 400">But I was instantly defeated by Marie pointing at herself poking her purple lips with an impish grin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGEwYThlZWVhZDQzODFhMzkzNzBkMWNlY2QxOWY2"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYzhkNGQxZTI2MTQ2MTNhMzMwNzQ4MjYzMmMzYWYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Logistics.” I grumbled, and sat back down.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTE2NzhjNWQ0ZjQwOTY5YWQ1YjU2NjcxOTNlMjgw"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NDRlMzZiYjAwNTQ1YmU4OGNkM2JhZTM2MTc0YTQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe! There is nothing that happens on this station that I don’t find out about!” She proclaimed and a few of the travelers at a nearby table looked up at her words but then went back to eating.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWRlZTQyMDA1MTRmODY4YTQ1YTYwZTU5ODkyNTA2"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMGJhOTU3YmVlMDQ2ZTQ4YmY5YzA0MTNjOGIwNWYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I see it?” Heather asked and I shook my head. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjE3OTgwM2MxMDQ2ZTc5NmFhZTFmMTQ4MjgxMDJj"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NDViMTVlOTI0ZjRkMzFiZDY4ZTJiNWQ4Zjk1YzUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s in the scrap field, inside an old super freighter that I’m using as a repair bay, and there isn’t anything to see.” I lied, but I didn’t want anyone to see the Diamond Core. Even if it was shut down and stable it still would instantly be a weird object people wanted to know about.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODA1NzY3ZTUwNzRlNTc4ODEzNDFjYmJmMDI2OGFj"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNmNlODFjMTcyMTRmM2RhOTY3NmQ3YjRmNTI2OWE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heather here wants to-”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up Marie! I don’t want to travel! I just like ships. I mean, more than just shuttles. I’ve always wanted to be able to really look around one, that’s all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure I’ll end up docking it at the station when it’s repaired, and I’ll be around. I’m not planning on leaving, leaving.” I admitted and Heather looked pleased. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTJmZTdmMGNlZDRhNzQ5OGMwMjMyN2NkN2VmNGY4"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of your audacious plans… I’m going to be denying your request.” Marie suddenly said and I looked up. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTVlNzBhNzE0ZTQ5MDk5YmRlNjA3M2Y2ZDlkMWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What why? It’s just cabling and-”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“And a dozen other things. All of which are being sent off station as soon as we get it.” Marie whispered and very sneakily looked around making sure no one was listening as she leaned in. “Something is going on. Every request for scrap parts has been surging and all of them are coming from the same place. L1T-Z Station.”</span></p>

Much closer to the capital of the Duchy though. Normally it acted very similarly to our own work, but if they were buying parts instead of just scrapping them, its secondary function had been activated. It was the station a refurbished fleet would be gathered in during war time. </span></p>

Seeming to realize he was still looking at her. He did his best to keep a glare off his face, but instead was using his ‘I am a disappointed superior’ look.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmY2U1M2JkOTQ3NzQ4NmM4ZWU2YWJiNTBkMDFiYTcx"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NTI0YjI3ZmE5NjQ2NmI4NjA0MTE5OTYzNTNjNzE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, what’s your question?” I asked back, smiling at the drone that looked up at me. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzBiMmZlZWJkYjQ3NmRhN2NiNWVjNDRlMGZlZTUy"> </p>
<p class="cnNlN2Y1ZDhlNzhlNzRkZDA4MGVhOTM5NDQ0YzljN2Ex"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Purpose? What is… My purpose?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWQyNDg5MWU3NTQxOTA4Y2RhMmU3ZjdjMjAxOWQz"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NjY0ZTdjZmNmYzQzYmU5ZGFkZmM2OTNhMzE5MDE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I went still at the sudden question, because it wasn’t normal. That’s not a question they should be asking, especially not yet. They didn’t have the… I looked around.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmRhZmUwN2VmNDQ5Y2E4Zjg2MWVlYjIxMWMyOTBh"> </p>
<p class="cnNlN2VmMmNlNzYwYjRmODc4NmI0MTQzMTUxZTYzZTIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? What is my purpose?” The Crabbit at my shoulder asked as well, and at that, like a virus, it spread through the crowd, any of the Crabbit that heard the question turned to ask it as well.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTQ0ODM4MTA2OTQ4ZWFiNDNiM2M2MjAxZTYzNmVl"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMmY1OGM3MDY4YjQzMWE4OGE0OThmZjFlODY3MzAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The crowd… How many Crabbits were in this room? A hundred? How many Iris Drives had they stolen out of things without me noticing?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDJkN2JkOThmNDRhOWJiNTJlOGFjYmUwMWQwNDNm"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNDZhZmIyMmEzNTRjZmI4MWQ4ZGEwNWE5OTY2Nzli"><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh. Had they just reached enough processing power to gain awareness? I smiled and reached down, pulled the Crabbit that first asked the question into my lap.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWMwZGI0ODViNjRkZGY4OTVmOWE1MTkwMjVmNzQx"> </p>
<p class="cnM5M2Y3OTdlOTdmYTRhMDE4ZDZkMzZjY2EzOTA1MWU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a tough question, and it’s not one that even I can answer for you. Purpose doesn’t come from someone else telling you what you are for, it’s for discovering it for yourself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Are we not helpers?” Another Crabbit asked, and I shook my head.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDM0ZWU4OGJkZDRiOTNhOTE0MjI3YzU1NDU4ZjYw"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNjBiZDc2NWNkYzRjNDZhM2NkZWExMTNkYTRmYjNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s your job, not your purpose.” I explained gently patting the Crabbit in my lap. “It’s easy to think they’re the same thing, but even for you little ones, it’s not true.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm.” The Crabbit in my lap muttered as it tapped a little claw to its face cutely. Where did it even find that motion? TV? “Purpose… Unknown. Uuuu.” It whined and I couldn’t help but fight back a snort at the poor thing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDZiOTc5MTIzZjQ0M2I4YzY3ZTE2MzZjNzViNmI1"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NjM2M2I0YTkyMjQ2OWU5YmIwNjVkYWM1YTBjMWVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know what my purpose is either.” I told her. “But someday I’ll have an answer, and so will you. It’s okay not to know.” I told her, continuing to tap her shell. It was a deep question, purpose. Was I reborn in this world for a reason? Some cosmic destiny, or just a mistake, a random blip of spacedust interacting with whatever soul I had?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjg1NTQ0ODYwMTQ4MzJhOWQ4ZDBkY2E3N2I1Njkw"> </p>
<p class="cnNmOTc2Y2FiYjE5MTQ2MWI5MWIxOTg0Y2I1Mjc5YjQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll keep living, and someday we’ll find our purpose together, okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Together. Together.” It repeated back to me, settled in to seemingly quite happily rest in my lap.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMxZThjNzM2ODExMjQ0OTg5NzM1ZjA0MzA0Y2FiYTg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The actual broadcast of the start of the war had finally happened, and while at first everyone had gotten tense, months of nothing meant that eventually everyone relaxed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWUyNzNhNjUzMTRhYzViOTM2NzBmNjc5NzhmNTk1"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYjk2MGE2YWFmZjRjNDNiNzQzYTZhZTYxNjEyOWJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">We weren’t anywhere near the front lines, or even the sidelines, or backlines.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODEzNDgyODRkYTRhNDY4ZTFkMmI3M2RiOTgxOTgw"> </p>
<p class="cnNkOWE0N2U2ZTJmMjRhYWM5YjkyMmY4NWQ5ZmFhMjNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Benefits of being far out onto the frontier.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmU1ZTNiZmUxYTQ5MjFhMWYyYTk0ZDU1ZDcwNmUz"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZWU1MmExZDAyNjQ0Y2U4YTA0NTUyNTllNDY0Mzll"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything slowly settled down, Baron Ritz slowly became a normal part of our lives, eventually a new status quo was reached. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWY2YjAyZGQ4ZjQxYTZhYTQyMzQ5NjQ3MzgyZWJl"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYTdkZDVkOWMxYjQ4MThhNDNiMDBiODYzNjBhMWJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which is why I was kind of uncomfortable. I had finished the Babbit that the Baron had requested, and Uncle Kyle had handed it over.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGEwZWVjMmUwNjQzYzg5ZmFkYzUyMDhlNzRjZDhm"> </p>
<p class="cnNjY2FjNDU4YWY1MDQ1YzI5NmM3ZjNiODc2ZWQ3MDdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">But instead of that being the end of things I had been called into a meeting a while later as I was heading out to prep another hull for transport. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjJkZjE0YzU2ZjQzOTJiMzA0NTA3MDhjNTA1NTFi"> </p>
<p class="cnNlN2Q1NDYzODE4NjQ2NzdhZmJiZWYyN2ZiYTZiM2Vh"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only when I entered the room did I relax a little. It wasn’t the Baron himself, but an older man, with a friendly smile, and a Babbit floating around his head.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTVkMzNhNzI0ZjQzNTBiZmVlOTVmZWQ3YTQ1OThm"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ODMxMjc2Y2QwNTQxYjY5ODJiY2ZhMTY1YjdlZTVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">If a Babbit liked him it was probably safe.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDg2ZGY5M2ZhNTRhMDE4ZWZmNjBhZmEyMGU3YjFh"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MGUxNmU0ZTIzMTQwMzFhNmM0NzgyNzFkZDA3NTdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm… Hello?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Good, good! Welcome come in come in, you’re Katherine correct? The bright girl that made these little drones?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, the Babbits are mine.” I said and waved at his drone, which waved back at me just a little.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTFhMzcyY2E5NjQ5ODM4OWI1ZWRjM2ViYzMzODNl"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMDcwMWQxMTcwNzRlZTE5Mzc2ZjY2NzZhMzc0ZTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How fascinating! Oh how foolish of me, I’m Eugene Kilver, I’m the chief engineer on the Octavius. But more importantly, I wanted to ask you about these delightful little drones. I apologize about this surprise meeting, but I had a delightful time looking into your little drone, and I had so many questions. Where did you get the AI work from? I’ve never seen an AI like it before.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I made it.” I answered honestly, my hands already brought to my chest as I wrung my hands at the look I received in turn. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTIzOTU5MmEyNjQxZmJiZWUxZDkyNTUyNDE0ZDQ2"> </p>
<p class="cnM2Nzk3NzczOGIxZjQ3YTdhNmM1MDVhMzkwM2QzNjY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?” He asked, seemingly disbelieving. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDMzNmE4MmFjYTQxYWJiY2Q0MTZlZTAzY2NjNDEy"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZGY1OTU5ZDgxMjQxZDU5NjY0MDMyMTk0ZWNhMDA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.” I fidgeted a bit under his stare. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzcxNWZkYTdhMTRmMTFhYmQ3NDM4OTkyYjE2MGM2"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YWJkOTZiNDc5NzRkOTU5ODYyYmE2MGFhYjJjODBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhmm! Kat made us!” The Crabbit at my shoulder chirped. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGE4NTcwOTFkMzRmNjJiYjIxZTNiMDYwNjM2NDU5"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZjg2NjU3YTYxZTQ4ZTdhZmY5NjIxNjEyNzM0OTk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Creator Katherine: True.” Babbit said from above Eugene, who looked up with a smile at his Babbits quiet halting words.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmVmOGRlMmRhYTRmMzM4NjYzNDljMzgwMjk4N2Uy"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMTBhZGMyN2ZhOTQ5MjA5NzQxMzAxYjEwZDA1Njhi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed? How fascinating. I’ve tinkered my hand with AI creation before. Where did you learn? Did you take some university program?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I blinked. That was a thing? I mean… I guess it made sense. If you wanted to learn something, it wasn’t like you could always travel the light years to a university. I just hadn’t considered what actual high end schooling would be like. Sure we had our educational programs, but those were very focused on the Scrapper Exam that we all took, and that was in house.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWNlNWNiNDgwMTQ2ZGVhMWMxYjViODZjMTA4ZTQ5"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NjBmZDE3YWYyMTQ4YzM4NTNjNjgzYjEyMDA2ZGM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Miss Katherine?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Oh! Sorry. I didn’t take any university programs. Just the educational programs we have on station. I didn’t know you could study university stuff like that… Probably should have.” I muttered but stopped myself from getting lost in thought. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjA4YTNmOGNjZTQ3OWVhMzM5YTg3MjllYjYwMjBl"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZmMzYTBlOWFjYzRjODQ4YTc5Y2E5N2I4NmM3MWQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Your educational program must be quite advanced then. Your programming is… Extremely pure.” He said, and then smiled. “If it isn’t too much trouble, I would like any documentation you have, on the creation and maintenance of these Babbits. I’m always interested in improving my own work after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh… Sure.” I agreed, and it wasn’t long before I relaxed a bit and was having a really fascinating conversation with Eugene about drones and their maintenance and creation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTUzZjc4ODkwNjQwOGVhM2MwMDA0Njg1N2JiNjdh"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNTVhNzAxNjRiNjQxNGZiODRjY2QzMjZhYjliNGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I actually picked up some tricks that would make any future Crabbits better. It was… Nice.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzdkNGYyMWMwZjRiYzk4NDg5OWMyMzJhMjUwMTEx"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZjY5M2NmZjAwMjQ0MjhiMTI1MmRjZWFjNTMzOTg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">—-</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDU4ZjA1NmI1MDRiNzQ5OGRjYTYwNmFmZTMwN2M2"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZjRjMWNhNzhlZDRjOWNiMGZlMzQ5NDc4ZTk0OWVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few days later, I decided to try my luck. It was my off day, and I had gotten bored of just watching the construction through my Crabbits eyes, and wanted to get back to my hangar so I could dig my hands back into the formation of my baby.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzI3NzRiMGNlZjQ4ZmU5Mzk4MzY5YjJiMWFmMDFh"> </p>
<p class="cnM2OGQxNTNiYmY2NDQwYzBhZWE5YWI2MWJhZDk3OTZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course everything had more restrictions now. I walked out of my apartment, and up to the docking ring level and couldn’t help but notice what was out of place.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjllODIxOTQ0YTRlZTVhMjdlNGFmMjM2ZmYyNzAz"> </p>
<p class="cnM0Nzc3Njk3NzA2YzRkNWE4NGEyN2ZhM2FhY2MxZjc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Guards, The Baron had stationed a small set of Marines on UNK-L to watch over things. We were told that it was for our protection, but everyone knew that the real reason they were here, was to enforce the law, and make sure everything kept going.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTY2ZmIzZDYzNTQ2YjU5OWU5ZmZkODY0NTEzNjMy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZWJkNGM3YmY3YzRkZTdhYzU4NWI0NTBlOThmMjRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It honestly wasn’t that big of a deal most of the time. There wasn’t anyone on station that had any interest in rebelling or stopping processing of the scrap field, but it was a restriction that altered our usual freedoms.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODJhY2JmMmY3YTQ0ZjY5Yzg4NjY1ZTVkZjFjODRk"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OGY5MzZiODNjYzQzZTRiODE4YmI2ZmY4ZjBkNjdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which is why I hadn’t been able to go out to the hangar myself. The scrap field had been restricted to only work crews.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGNlNzRjNTExNTQwOTJhOGM4YTU5ZTRmMzhmNDk2"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMDQzY2I5Yjc4MzRmZDY4ZTQ0YjA1YjJkODcwMjE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">But… I wasn’t planning on going to most of the scrap field. I wanted to go to the hangar that was already registered as my drop off, just like Aunt Sheila had her shop on station, and technically the hull inside, the old freighter had been gifted to me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTc4ZDU1YTU1MDQzOThiMWIyMTlkNzZhZGVkMDkw"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMTNlZjkxOWI2NjRhODk4YzRlYmFiNmI1Yzg1YjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was mine. So… I should be allowed, right?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjIxMzE2NmI4MTRlMzZiNjc2NTYzMWI1ZmMxZTc2"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNjdiZTU2ODZmYjQ2NWE4ZDJkN2VlNmM0MWI1YTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked along the docking ring, towards one of the hangars. I was looking for someone that could actually give me permission, as I was done just accepting that I wouldn’t get access to my own stuff.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjhhMjlhNTE1OTRiYWRhMTAwYjY2ODRhMWY2NzIw"> </p>
<p class="cnM5OGUyZjFiN2I2MDQwYzlhZWVlOTA3MDJhYjM5ZjJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle Kyle was here. Supervising, he didn’t always, but we were processing a hull and waiting for the transport ship that was going to come and transport it out of the system. I had been one of the crew working on it the day before, so I knew Uncle Kyle would be here, and I knew they’d mostly just be waiting around.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODlmYzEzZmQzYjRjNzFhN2Q3MDE0Yzk2YjIxYTM0"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZjA2NzRhMjQyZTQ0MGNiYmE5NjQxZmFiMDRiYzM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath as I entered and firmed my spine as I strode across the busy hangar. It was mostly open, although some parts were being put onto the hull in large containers, for transport. Basically some of the equipment would need to be refitted quickly that we could send along.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGI2NjBhYzMzZTQyY2FhOTUxN2Y0NDMwYzhkZmVk"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDgyOTI4MDE4YjQ2YjJiNDliNmVjY2Q2NzQwOTZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was all part of the refit process that we took part in during war time.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzk0ZmJmN2NmYTRkMGRhYTY4ZWI0ODUwOTQ5ZGZm"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Work crews were walking from the hangar before taking a small leap into zero G to land inside the old passenger liner? A Nauxia. They had nice interior design, but terrible hulls. Too many windows. Those would be covered, and the outer rooms likely filled with quick armor foam.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzMyOWZlOWZhOTQzZTFiMTg5OTE5Yjk4NDBjYWFh"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZWY1ZjMxNTYxNTRhZTFiZDhlOTc5YTE1ZTA4MWRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I tore my eyes away despite how much I wanted to keep looking, because spaceship! My brain was hardwired to want to stare at the flying ships.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTVjODVlNjQzNDQ2YWI5OWQ0YjcwODg4MDIyY2Yw"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZmI3YTEyY2NiMjQ3MjJhOTRlOTI1MzE1MDZhZjZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle Kyle was standing next to a container. He had his Tab in hand and was going over the contents inside, as some of the workers dropped equipment off, floating each piece across the hangar thanks to the gravity panels making the parts weightless.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWY5OWI5YjAxYjRmYWY5MWY2OTA1Njk2MGZmZTg5"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YTg4MGNjMDBiMzQxY2M4NzY1MjMwZWMzNDRiMjM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked up and only when he turned to acknowledge me did I speak.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTFkMDJlYjFmZDQ0NTI5ODBjZGQ3YTNlYWVlZTVl"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOWM4ZWIzM2U3ODQ2MDc4YWY0OGQ5MDU3MWQzMjY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Katherine?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uncle Kyle. Sorry to bother you. Todays my day off, and I know the restriction with the scrap field, but I was wondering if there was a way I could get permission to visit my Freighter? I… Just want to work on it.” I managed to speak it all without stuttering which was a relief, but as I finished, I felt my shoulders hunch in as I waited to be refused. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGJkYWVjYTE2MjRkYjFiZjdhZmY4MzU5NzVmMDI4"> </p>
<p class="cnNkN2YzMGRmYTZjNzQ2OWZiZGRiMDNhYzRhZTg0NmU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was stupid. I should just go back to my room and supervise over my Tab. They weren’t going to let me go. Everyone was being super strict about this sort of thing!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTgxNWYxY2E5ZDRkNjVhNDRiZjMzYzJiMmEyOGIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. A moment.” He finally spoke and I almost flinched at his voice, but he didn’t sound angry, or upset. Instead after a moment his Tab beeped, and I flinched very hard at the appearance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzlhNTc1NDlhODQ4M2JhMDgxZTkyYzU3YTkwYzY5"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMDQ2MzFlODFhMTQ2ZjM4ZGZhMzFkZmYyNjVhNzJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is Cyger.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Forgive me for the interruption Baron Ritz. I simply had an unusual situation that I wanted to confirm with you.” Uncle Kyle deferred, and the Baron from what little I could see from Uncle Kyle’s Tab didn’t look angry, instead curious.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODc3ZGEzY2NiNzQxNTI4ZDdkNTVkMzBiMmNkZDFm"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well Station Master. What is the situation?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“One of my family had asked for a hull from the scrap field a while back. She’s been working on it in her free time fixing it up. Unfortunately with the lockdown and restrictions that has been stopped for some time, but she has come to me requesting access. Considering the hull is her own I would like to support this request if possible.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzE2MmI4MjI5NTQ4YjI4ZDZmNThhNTU0NmU1YTdj"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YzAzMTc2ZmM3YjRhOThhM2FiMDBmOWNhNDBiNTJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. You understand the concern about access to the ship field. They are all now military assets.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do. Katherine is a smart girl. She knows it would be foolish to try and take something that doesn’t belong to her. But in this case the ship is her own.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Katherine you say? Ah, yes. I remember, Eugene spoke highly of her… Very well. I’ll allow you to approve an access token.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you Baron.” Uncle Kyle said with an almost bow, and that was that. The Tab Comm ended with the Barons' own acknowledgement.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Zjc3NzgyY2NmZDRiYjBhNGJlOTcyZjNjMDFjNjIy"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZjAxZThmZTMxYTRmYTZiYzk3YTM1ZWM3ZjM2MjJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was almost too frozen to realize though.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyOGZjYzc1ZDhlZDRiYjliOTQ3ZmVmYTk2YjNjMWJj"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOGRjNzhmYjNkNDQyYmU4OTQyZTNkNWMyYjYwYWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go!” I roared out and work resumed.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhYWE3YTgxMmNlMjQxYjY4MWQ0OTVjNGQ1ZWNkZjRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is really really stupid.” I whispered to myself as I guided the Diamond Drive through the hallway. The completely bare hallway that had no panels covering the plasma conduits, that didn’t even have lights. I was guided by a flashlight as I stopped at where the door to the engine room would be.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODc0NjA4ZTZkNTQzODhiNjYyYjkyY2M5ZTAyMzUy"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NTViNTQyY2M0YzQ2YzE5ZDYzZDA0ZWQ2NGNjYmM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had one.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyZGRiNWNjMGE4NTRmZmU5YjBjZDRjNWU1Zjg4MTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Diamond drive was still inactive. I hadn’t dared activate it in any place that wasn’t the engine room with all its shielding. No telling what a warship's sensors could pick up without that meager protection.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmUxOTE4NzQ4MTRiZjk4N2I5OTZiM2JjMjAwOWY2"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NzE4MjI2MGQzNTQxZWRhNmY3Njg0YTA2ZDA4MmMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crabbit floated the drive in, and I nodded, floating over to the consoles that were already bolted and hooked in, I flipped the switch and nothing happened. No power?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDA4MjMyYTE0MjQ3ZDY4NDM1Njg4NWViMTJhOTkz"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZjQwZjU5MDkzYTRjNzg4MTAwZTNmYTkxMjVkNmJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I crouched down and checked the front panel where the tiny Iris Drive was inserted, Hmm… I pulled it out and checked the connectors. They were fine. Flipped it around, did the power connectors get installed backwards?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTQ4ODlmN2QzYzRlYmQ5NTJiM2NjNmE0OTc0MGVi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYmQ4YjRkNjAyMTQyZDU5MTkxNWQ1YzBkNWI0NTRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nope. I pulled it again and inserted it, and this time the console activated.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjFkOTQ2OWViYTQ0MTFiN2NiODE4NWEwZWFmZTgw"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMzlmMTc4ZWMyODQ1MDQ4MTAxY2MyMDI1ZTg0NjBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Figures.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1YjZjMTdjZDM4OTRkMDg4ZjY3YjA5MzU3NjZlODEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a few taps I opened the locks that would hold the Drive in place. The custom work for the differently sized drive creaked open a little but I relaxed. They just needed a bit of oil. The Crabbit were always a bit stingy with it for some reason. Always muttering about more for them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWM5OWQ0OGFmNDRmNzY5YzkyMjk1YzQ4YTBjMWVi"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYjZkMDFkOTFhNjQ3OTFiODI2MzdmYmNkNjI1ZWRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded as they inserted it into place, and I pressed the button and the machinery came down. Locking it in place and I felt the nervousness shift through me.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzOGVmMzJlYjg4ZjRkNjFiYjg4Y2ZkZGExMzFmMDA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran down the checklist. Thermal Lance Turret on the Bow? Installed and triple checked. Engines? Installed and quadruple checked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjczNDExYzhlNzRjYTg4MzZlZGEzNjM0YTlmNjY2"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYmEwN2MzODc2ODRjMDk4NjU1ZGU5YzU1NDE4ODE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Plasma conduit cabling had shown all green on the checks… We had a semi functional ship... Once it had power.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwNWFiODYyMDRmYTQxNjE4MjQ2N2FkMGRlYjE1NzE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Open Diamond Drive!” I commanded and watched as they maneuvered the drive open showing the space for the Iris Drive. “Insert the Core!”</span></p>

<p class="cnNhYzIyMmRmNzVkMTQ2NWM5OWI5YzNlZWViYmFhNzIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then it began the Drive screwed shut. “Insert the Iris Drive Array!” The small Iris Drives were inserted and locked in place, and everything showed green. It was time.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwNWM3OGYyNjg0MTQzYjA5OTRkOWM4M2ZlZmZjMjUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t say activate though. Instead I grabbed my helmet and threw it on. Then I called Sheila.</span></p>

<p class="cnM5MjEwZjViNGM5ZjQxZDhiYTA2ZTAyNDUyNzQxY2Rh"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Brat? You’re past the time I said. You-*</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">*Aunt Sheila. I’m about to connect the drive. Can you let the station know that it’s not some pirate in the Scrap Field?* I cut in interrupting her grumbling and after a moment she gave a sigh.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDJhYWFiNTEwMDRhMDc5ZWE5MzY2NDkwYjMxOTRj"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNjMwODVkNGNkYTRjODg5YWI3ZjFjY2IwYWZjMWJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Alright, just give me a minute.* The line cut but I didn’t continue. Instead I looked at my Crabbit. “Prepare for launch!” I called out and most of them burst out of the room to head to their stations. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzU0ZTYwYzJhYTQ0NzVhNTBkZmQ2OTJhZTY5MjAy"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YmIzZDM4MDM2MzQyZGNhOTAyZDdjZDVhM2E0MjQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">And I waited, just as I was getting antsy my radio crackled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjQxMTc2MGM0MzQ3MGQ5NjUyODA2MDM5ZGNhYmQz"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDRmMWU2ZjU5MzQzYTliODdmMjlkM2VkNzdlNTUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Katherine.* The voice wasn’t Sheila though.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxNzIxZmQ2NmQxYTQyMmViMWMyMjcyODM5MDI2MTg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Station Master.* I replied back being formal to my Great Uncle.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmNzU5OGI5MWNhOTQ1M2U5NzlhMjY3ZDhlNDU3ZTQ1"> </p>
<p class="cnNjY2NmMzJlNzlhNjQ3MTdiYzZjODdmMjA2MTJlZWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact was, I had a ship now, which made me a ship captain. That meant I wasn’t just another scrapper on the station. I was something else.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzdiYWNmOGJlMTRiZjViNDZiMzczMWFmNDU3NzAw"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OTEzNGExYTc1ZTRiMTFiMmZmOTJkYjA1YTNhNWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Family still sure, but not… Not just another cog in the machine. It had shifted the dynamic.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDM2Mzc3NGYzMDRiNDdiNTM3MzYwNTU3ZTc1ZjAy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDQwZWUyZTA4ODQ2OGRiN2E2OWI1MzU0NDQ2MjFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Very well. We are ready for your activation.*</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">*Very well.* I replied back and cut the line.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkYjJkY2Q0MGZiYTRkMmZhMmZhNzVjZDUyMGZiOWQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ignite the Diamond Drive!” I called out and the white light of the drives once more shifted to an angry red as the rift expanded and soon there was a stable rift generating power. What few lights we did have installed came alive. Consoles, lighting up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjM4OTU1M2IzZDRhMjY4MWUxMjA0MDNmOWJiZGFh"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNzgxMTQzNDBjOTQ3ZDBiNjU1ZTZiZjc0NzM2ZDIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rumble of the Diamond Drive gave the ship a light rumble that reminded me of a purr. The noise of a good engine rumbling and well maintained, but it was all energy colliding with matter.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjUwZWI4OWZmMjQ4MzliMmIzMjRlMTI0NGQ1MzI3"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OGY1OWRmZjM5OTQ3ZjdiNjcwZjVjNzJmNjE5YWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned and no longer had to float through the ship as the gravity plating came online and I stalked forward, feeling the ship come alive slowly as I walked up and took the ladder to the bridge as the elevator was still nothing but dreams and hopes for the future. I stepped out into the brightest section of the ship. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGFmMDMwNjI1YTQzYTlhYjhhZTYxMDc5OTlhYmFm"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNDRkOWZmZjkwODRmYTU4YzNhOGRmNTA5NDczZDU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The bridge was brightly lit consoles set up in a formation letting the Captain chair overlook them all. The bridge showed outward into the stars, and I took a moment to look out through the crystal glass. It was already active. Open view to space wasn’t just an incredibly powerful see through crystal, it also had embedded virtual access. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWRjMDAxYTY1YzQwNmI4MDFmOWIzZjk3YzcxYWQ5"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MDcxOWFmYzRlOTRhMWI4ZTZiYmNkYjZiNzU4N2Qw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Letting it highlight anything the sensors could see, mark objects, or even zoom in. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmEwY2E3MzRhYTRmODhiNGE2MGQ1ZTViNTlkNDYw"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YzNmMjExYmJjNzRkZGZhMzdhYTBmZmJjMzIxZGVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The view looked out over the bow, and the Thermal Lance turret that was already going through checks as the Crabbits had the turret shifting left and right to test the movement.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODc5YzFiNmJiMTRlNDViZjdjMjk2MDFkOTM4OWQ3"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNDQ2NjViMTM0NTQ3Yjc4N2VmY2IzY2NlZTYzZWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Status!” I called out and the Crabbits all chirped happily.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Functional! Functional!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“All working!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjg5YWI4ZWZiNjRiNWQ5ODNjMDU5Nzc2MWM1OTMy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NTk1NTRhMWU5OTQzNmU4N2Q0MTMwNzI0Njk3ZjI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaaaah. Non-function!!” I nodded at that one. Half the ship components still weren’t powered. We had engines. We had weapons. And we had some internal systems, but our shields were still offline.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjA2ZGIzN2U1YTQwOGZhOWJkOTBmZTY1YzE4M2Jj"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YzNhMjFiMzJlNTQ4ZTNiZDcwNGRiOTdjMTlkOTY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">But then the most important Crabbit called out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWY3ZDZjOGY1MzQyNDU5MGUyNzVmOTBiN2E3YzM1"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Engines yaaaay! Engines good good!” It cheered and the others cheered back and I felt myself relax a tad but I still remained standing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2YzY2QxZTViNTQwNmZhYTI1ODJiYTRmN2FiMjZm"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZmY2NjRjMDM4ZDRmZTk4MDNiMmJhNjE0MjE5Y2Vm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Never had found a good enough chair.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDU1NzIwMzBkNDRlN2ViNmQ5N2VhYjcxNTk1MjEx"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YWMzYTQzMTM4YTRkOWRhMTkyMDQxMjQ1MGU3ZWI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Docking Clamps?” I called, to one of the Crabbit.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Disengaging, is clear!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWE3MmExOWUwNjRkZDlhZmUzMjkwNGQzMzMyZGQw"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMzhiNzlkZDMyYzRlNDA5MzA0MTNlMTAxNGYyYTc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded and walked over to the engine console. I swallowed a bit of spit and breathed in and out, and then reached out. Everything was still bare bones here. The captain's chair was just a chair I had stolen from another freighter, and it didn’t even have any control surfaces. I was controlling the ship from a Tab’s touch controls.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWFmZjg2ZGNhZTQ5NzFhOWQ1ZmM2YjBkODQ1OTkw"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZTNiOGZjZTY1ZDQ4Y2U4NDk2MWJlY2RhN2U2YTY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I breathed in and out, as my finger touched the thrust control. Although the Crabbit could drive the ship too, this was for me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWRlNTkwMDBhZjRkMjg4N2FkN2Y5NWI3MzU1NjQ4"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NTk3YmJiNDNiMTQ1MzlhYjhiYjMzYjY4YjEzZDg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phantom Star! Engage!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGNmMGQ4MzQzMTRjYzc4M2QyMTI3YzVmMWYzNzFi"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZGVjNTEwN2NhYzRhOTNhNDc4NjU5Njg3OGI4ZTUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I pushed. Just the slightest force, and the control ticked up just a single point, but that was all we needed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2ExNzZiZjY5NDQyNzM5ZDI5MDIyMDMyYjZiZDc2"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YmEwM2M4MmMyOTQ2YWNiNWE3Y2ZlNWNkNjJmNWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later my ship. My ship. Inched out of the Hangar, sunlight splashing across her pristine hull. Making her look pure white under the sunlight as the bridge cleared the Hangar entirely and then I just kept her moving. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWJkYzMzZWVkYTRmODg5NmY3YTA1OWMxYjkzZDAz"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNDRhMDU0OTdjMjQ0YzFiYmNkODlhZTUwNWVjOTE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Plot a course out of the Scrap Field.” I asked the Crabbit at the navigation console who chirped and shifted even as I pulled back on the engines. Until we were free of the old Super Freighter that had been my Hangar for so long. And returned to a complete null motion.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGUxOTFhMjAwMjRlMjg4OWQxZjI2NGQ1OWFiMjI3"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NjM0NTNiZGJiODQyNjdiNDQzYTMzODljZDNhZTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Course projection!” Navigation called out and I checked the screen for the plot…</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWEzZTIxMjQ4ODQ3OTU4ZWY2N2Q0MzQxNjI4NDFi"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMTkxMWNhNGIwMjQ1ZDlhNTBmNzk4OTkxZmM4OTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m gonna have to do that.” I decided because that course I’m pretty sure would lead us right through multiple scrap ships and then collide with the moon somehow, before reaching the Station.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Njk4NjYwMjVkMjRjNDRiMmEyMDg0YWZlZTg3YTA4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NTgwODZjZTJjNzRjMTFiZDZjZTQ3ZjcwYTMzMGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu.” The Crabbit whined as I took its seat and started adjusting the course. Showing it how to do it.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhZTY1ODAxZTdlYjQwNzJiYjI2ODIzMjhiNzQzYWI1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyle Ferrous Manager of Scrap processing station UNK-L</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhNmQ2NzFmZjllNjQyMDI5ZTExODVkZTU3ZjM5YjVj"> </p>
<p class="cnNhN2JjMzIzNWY5NzRjOTE5ZGUyNjEwNDE0NTI1ODA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyle had seen a lot over the years. Pirate ships detonating in plasma fire. Scrappers hauling an alien Vordt ship behind them which quickly got snatched up by the Duke.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWFlYjMwM2YzYjRkMjBiNWQ5NWM0ZTY4ZGU3YjJl"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYjJlMGQ5OWNmNzRiOWRhYzVkMWJiY2EwMzIzYjlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">This wasn’t even the first time one of his scrappers had taken a ship and tried to get it running.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjIyNWVhMmVhZjRmYzM4NTg1NTc1MjlmMmYxYjZh"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time he looked at a ship and simply couldn’t understand how it came to exist.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGI4ZjdmNjM4YzQzNjFiZjQ0MGU5MjM0YjM2M2Rm"> </p>
<p class="cnM3Zjg1OTk4NjVhYzRiNTdiMmU2YzJkNjlkNjIwZmIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Katherine had always been a bit strange. Her repair work had always been impressive so much so that her file was filled with commendations for her actions repairing random stuff around the station even before she passed her Scrapper Exam and got the job in truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NThiZTlmMjAwODRjZDZiNDRhZDUzNjFhZWZmOTg4"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NTE4YmNjYWEzMDQwOTdhMzJiMGE0YmU4MjlkYTMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">But as the ship Katherine was piloting, pulled through the scrap field and came into view, he was struck wondering. It wasn’t the old hull she had bartered for. The scrap hull she had been given was an old rock breaker. A cargo hauler.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmY4YTA4ZDRhZDQ3M2E4OTBjZGFiOTcxMmQxNTEz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyM2E1MjAyN2RhMzRkZTRhYzg1YzIzMjI3YjMxODEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t a sleek warship. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDFlMTBjYWJmYTQ4ZGY5YzJmMWEwZDNmZTZjYWVl"> </p>
<p class="cnMzY2IxYjA4MGUyYTQxOTc4NDQ2YmNiZjllYmQ5NzI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">And what he was seeing docking to his station was a warship. This was a Corvette, armored, and armed in a way no tramp freighter could match.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWVlYmE4YzZkMzQ5ZTJiMzRiOGY2MzA3MzRiYzZi"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYTZjMTlkNjJmZjQwZTJiYWUzMmJiM2ZkMTI4MzE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">He watched as it approached. Taking note of its appearance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODQ0YzA2YWVhZDQ4NDA4ZWQyMjJlYjVmNTc0OGRl"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZWI0ZDU2MzVjMjRjMjZiMmRiNGNiMGJhMWY2NmMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">It looked a little slim, the port and Starboard were almost… too flat. Like the ship hadn’t been completed. Its bow was more curved and aggressive. The superstructure of the freighter had been a rather blunt hull. The bridge had been right at the front. Not so on this.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTNjZWNiZmMwNzRhOGU5NGUzYmExOWFhYTNmZTc0"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYjAxZGVmNjk3MjQwMmRiNGZjYjBhYWExYTE4MzE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweeping top bridge with armored crystal glass, again, wasn't right. This wasn’t the ship he had traded for those drones.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDdhM2FmZmI4YjQ3MTZiYzYzZjI5OTQ5YzRhZjdk"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MmZjNTlkNWRjYTQ2ZmJiY2MwMDIyMDNmZGZhYTA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">This wasn’t right. Where had she found this? Where had she gotten the Iris Drive to power it?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2MzYWI2MGEzZjQ4OTk5MDU3MGI0MGI0MTE0MTRj"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NGM3ZjAwMTFmMTRhMmE4ZTAwNThlZTE3M2EyNGYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">He watched as the two engines in the back shut off as it finalized docking. </span></p>

And perhaps she would let slip an actual explanation. But before he could continue they were interrupted. The Baron had left people behind on the station to make sure deliveries of components were sent out on time, and one of them approached.</span></p>

But I was sold a superstructure for my work and this is what I ended up with. You’d be amazed at how much a ship can be altered when you have an entire group of Drones working on it around the clock.” Katherine said after hesitating for a while. She didn’t seem comfortable with the Baron's man.</span></p>

I am required to ensure nothing was stolen. I don’t mean to accuse you, you understand, but a simple check of some of the equipment, particularly the Iris Drive will resolve the issue.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don’t think I’ve stolen it, then you have no business on my ship.” She denied him and Kyle felt a bit of tension. This could be bad. Had she stolen the Drive?</span></p>

<p class="cnNhY2Y3MWQwODVkYTQ1ZmY5N2I4NGM1M2FjY2QxN2Rj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That seems premature. A simple inspection and you will be cleared of any wrongdoing.” The auditor argued, and Kyle winced as Katherine instantly started glaring in response.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Either you suspect I’m a thief, or you don’t. You’re waffling. Since you just learned my ship existed. You couldn’t have any evidence that I stole anything.” She argued hotly, her voice getting quite angry which is rare for the girl from his understanding. “I can’t be cleared of wrongdoing if there is no evidence I did the wrongdoing in the first place!” She added and Kyle decided it was best to step in.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2Q1OGE0MzRjNTRkZWZiYmRjMDczM2JlMTVjNjhh"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps we table that discussion for now?” He cut in. “Katherine you aren’t planning on leaving right away are you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No… The Phantom needs a lot of work still. I just needed to get her engines and weapons online in case of the pirates showing up… Unless I need to leave?” She asked almost plaintively, and he instantly shook his head. </span></p>

<p class="cnM1OGI3YWMxMDMwYzQ1ODlhMmRkZWVkZGY3NDk1ODYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The large cannon turret on the prow of the ship caught his eye. She said those were functional? He wanted to start laughing. What an absurd girl. Where did any of this come from?</span></p>

<p class="cnM4MzFjMjkwZmY3YjQyNzdiMTUyYTYwZDExODYyYmFi"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">She was more concerned about what it looked like than what people might find? What an odd child.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3MzEwN2QzYTAzNzQ5YTE4ZGU4YTc5NjY4MzY2MmQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">He knew there weren’t any missing Iris Drives. So he knew the auditor wouldn’t find any evidence of theft that way. If there had been a theft of a drive capable of moving this ship he’d have been notified immediately, and the entire station would have been shut down. There was no point in worrying over that.</span></p>

I was half way into the navigation console when it happened and had to fight myself free to see what was going on. I turned to the large window and I knew what was happening. The shifting of space was visible to the naked eye for a second, and then in a flash of resurgent matter returning where there was none before a ship appeared.</span></p>

I can't imagine the repair time, but her armor will hold up better than normal. I’ll bet it’ll surprise our pirate friends quite a bit… Not that it’ll matter much without proper shields.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmY5M2UxMDY4ODQ0MmJhODhiOGFiNTcyYzM2YjMy"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYmIwNWY1NDFjMTQ5ZWZiODM0OGZiMmUyZDExODY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do we need to help her?” Cyger asked. He hated to even consider it, but two ships were better than one and a half.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTk0YmI3ZDJjZTQ1NmE4ZWQ0N2M0YjgyODVmNThm"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wouldn’t even know where to start Sir. This isn’t a common design. In fact it’s not in any database. If I had to put creds on it? I think she designed it herself. It has some hallmarks of young designers.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2Q4ZWE4OTdhYzRmNjNiYzYwNGM5ZTFiZjBjODJm"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YjgxNGJiNDliOTQ3Nzc5YzBjMDUwMjA2NmZiMTAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impossible.” Cyger responded instantly. Creating a ship wasn’t something someone could just do by themselves like that!</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzhmZWEyNjRkOTQ1N2ZiZjhiNjM5ZGE0NTU5N2Q4"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNTcwMTgxNTkwNjQxYjU4Yzg5YTYxNzcwMDI2MmJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not impossible. Improbable, but as I said sir. I’d put my Creds on it. The ship is too… Rough. To be from a normal shipyard. Look look, it does something strange with the sides of the ship! The design stutters there. Like she made a mistake while building. I think that’s why the sides of the ship are so flat.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzMxZjAwMzFjYjQ5NDM5NTdjMDYwOTM2NDRjZjQ5"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YWNjYzc0ZThhMjRhODZiODM0NThkMjRlMmJhYmJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyger took in this information and wanted nothing more than to press on it. But stored it away. Whether it was true or not was unimportant to the fact of what was happening.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTAzOWQyMWEzOTQ5NjhhOGUzN2FhOWNkYTkwYTAy"> </p>
<p class="cnMwOWYxOTgxMzBiODRlMWJiOTQ3MjhiYjI5NmI4ZDE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well. Artemis?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sir!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Confer with her, and set up a doctrine to use the ship.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes Sir.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“And Eugene. Continue to keep an eye on that ship, having an additional ship will be useful but I need repairs done.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood my lord, understood.” Eugene remarked calming down from his excitement and soon he was off to go find some new damage to his ship to repair.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjNiOGQwMzY2MDQ0MTQ5MWFjMTRkZjliNDdlMmRi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNjYxYWM2ZGZmNDQ5ZmJhNGYyNjZlNTlmY2JiYjJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anything on our scanners?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing Sir. But we will keep looking.” He nodded at that and moved to his command throne.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzZlZWRiMTYwMjQ4ZWU5MmY3OTgxZDg5YzNhYjFj"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYWE5YmE3ODRlZjQ3MTk4Y2YwNTY4NTcwZWZjNjUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">What were the Pirates planning? When would they attack? And in how many numbers?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmFiYTJiYjk4NDRhNjQ4ZWRkYmIwYzIxMmE3ZTQ1"> </p>
<p class="cnMzODlhZTNjODgwZTQ2NDZhOTY2NzJiMmFlMzA4ZWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">He felt his fists tighten in his gloves. This was meant to be a milk run, an easy duty assignment to keep him out of trouble during this war. It was an insult and a gift wrapped in one, and now, it might be far more.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGI0MWQ3Y2JmZTRkYWI5MjUwMmRjY2UxOTRhZGE3"> </p>
<p class="cnNhOGQ2ODFiYjc2MzRjNGZhOWJlMTE1NTFmNGZhODg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">If he succeeded, there would be no lauded rewards in his future. It was expected to defeat pirates, and none would accept that this pirate group was any threat. Even if they would normally be handled by an entire task fleet.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjljZTM3ZGE4YjQ4NjFhYTU1YzYxMGM4ZDI1MGQ4"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMzJjNzU4ZDBiNzQzNzY4MjcwYmExY2FhNWMyZDgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Worse still, if he failed… Failure would ruin his future. What a bitter fruit this gift turned out to be. </span></p>

<p class="cnNkNWZkYjEyNjUyYTRiZDA5NDc2MDRiYjFlNzg0Zjli"><span style="font-weight: 400">My anxiety was getting to me, my hands folded into themselves in a constant twisting as I looked at the man opposite me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2RmZTAzMmI2MzRkMjI4NzdmZGRmMzcyYThhN2Vi"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ODc1MzYyMWEzZDRlZWE4MDJhMjNmMmE3YTY1Zjk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do be more at ease my dear I beg, you are making me anxious.” Chief Engineer of the Octavius, Eugene sat across from me gently sipping his drink. We were at the Hab deck on the station, and we were even sharing a meal of sorts.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTU3MzM2MWQzODRhODhhYmM4ZGE2Mjg3MTdlNTJm"> </p>
<p class="cnNmOWI1MmVkYmJkMDQ0YTRhMjhiNmU3ZTJiNTljMjAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I just felt so awkward. I was doing everything I could to pretend some of the parts on the Phantom Star weren’t stolen, but I think the old engineer had noticed it right away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTM3MzliZmEzNTRkNTliNDRjNTYyMWMwNWQyZGEz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNThlYTM1YjNiNzQxNjJhYTgwOTcwZWQzNDhiZjk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looking at this, I can be reasonably sure your Thermal Lance is functional. Absolutely astounding, to put such a weapon together yourself. Thank you for letting me get a look at it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I found plenty of the parts on old ships, most of the rest was just manufacturing the parts.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yet that’s no simple task. I don’t suppose you’d let me peek at your manufacturing method? No, no I can already see that you won’t.” He spoke with a laugh, before I could even say anything, smiling at me as if he was sharing a good joke.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjJiZTAwZGI3OTQ0MDg5YmFiODI2YmUyMTc3Mzhm"> </p>
<p class="cnNiM2E3MTliZGZkYTQxNmNhYTZlZDBlMDdiY2UwZDM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">That only made it more awkward, because I didn’t want to share the joke! I wanted him to stop trying to figure out all my secrets!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTBiNTllMmI0OTQwNzBiZDlhYjhjNDQzZGY2MjQ2"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYmU0YzhlNzQ2ZjQxNTE4NmE3YzE1MjIxZWZlYTk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well enough of me enjoying myself.” He said looking almost fondly at his Tab as he set it down. “As much as I loved going through the construction of your delightful vessel. I’m here as the Chief Engineer first. The Baron in his wisdom wishes to offer you assistance.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think I need help? Probably.” I whispered and the man smirked as he took a moment to grab a bite from his meal. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTQ3YzZmMmQ3NzRmN2I4Njk1ZDNlOTlkZDIxMTI4"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZjg3OTkxMTUzYzQwMjVhODg0MjRjZDM3ZWY4YzJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t just mean an offer for one of our repair teams. Although if you would be willing we would assist you. This is a serious situation after all, but I was particularly speaking of spare parts.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Power Cables.” I said instantly. The damn things were never long enough! </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWZmODI4MjBlNjQzYWQ4Njg0MjE1ZTNjOTgxZDUz"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNzY4OTAxMTI1MzQ3ZTk5Mzc4NzMxMzEyYzUzZGQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah yes, I’ve been in that situation. Never enough of them is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDE5MmRjZWY4YTRiMjBiZDMyNWI4MTlmNzRkOWQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.” I grumbled, my anxiety slowly dropping as he laughed in shared misery. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjIyYzBiZDI3NDQ0OWVhM2VmZmY3YTQ1NDI3N2Vl"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NTRjYjFkZTM3OTRiN2JiZTIyMGVkZGZhYTNiYTFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well that I can assist you with, the Octavius of course has large stocks of the things, but this wonderful station will be sending a delivery with quite a few of them soon. It won’t be any trouble to have them reserved. I’ll have a tech start dropping off some cabling in front of your ship's airlock if that works?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Crabbits can take it from there, yeah.” I said, and the Crabbit on my shoulder chirped happily not interrupting the conversation but letting me know she had told the others. I reached up to pet her chassis, she wouldn’t get much from it, but there was a very human instinct to pet things.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjJlY2RlNWYwNzQzYjU5YWYxZWRjODJjNzkwNGEz"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYWRkMDBlOTk4YjQyNTJhMWRiMDA5OGRlYjAyZTM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Delightful! Then let’s talk-”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kat?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mom?” I asked, turning as I saw Mom walking towards me. She seemed worried for a moment, until she seemed to recognize Eugene. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDdiM2UzN2UyMTRjZTY5N2E3ZWNkNmIwZjUwZGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh! Chief Engineer greetings to you.” Mom offered with a curtsy bow thing that she had tried to teach me a few times but I just wasn’t good at it. “I hope my daughter is on her best behavior?” Mom asked a little pointedly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2NiNjBmMjVhYzRiYzFhYjY1ZTZiMzljMjhjMDMw"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OGIxMjYxNDIwZDQ2YmRiYzc3ZmI1YWYxODA5ODYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which wasn’t necessary! I was always on my best behavior!</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGFhOTAzMjQ0MjRiZjI4NmU5ZDc0ZmNjYWE5OWYx"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh she is simply fascinating, and no insult has been given. Eugene Kilver.” He offered, and Mom smiled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWJlYjhlOTA5MTQ3ZmVhN2I1ZmM5Zjg3NTdkYmNi"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYmRhMmQzMTZiYjRkOWY5ZWQ4YzYxYWRkMzY5MDc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lina Ferrous, although I rarely get to use the last name.” She explained and Eugene offered a laugh. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTVhMDYwMTc1MzRiOGI4NWNkMDc0ODM4NmJmMGQw"> </p>
<p class="cnM5OTRjZWRhZGQwMTQzOTNhOWU4OTMxZDgwOTQwZmZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s an odd custom, but not unusual for large families like this I’ve found. I was just speaking to your daughter about her ship.” Eugene offered, and Mom lit up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWZiMzRjNGJmMTRlN2FhNjNhNjlmNWNmNGVmZjU1"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZDU2ODc4N2Q3NTQ3MWVhYzdjZWI1NDI4YjZmY2Rm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom, even more than Dad, was proud of me for the Phantom Star.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWVmNWUxNGUxMzRmNjU4MWQ1ZGRlNzI5MTUxZjBj"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NWQ4N2E5ODVmNjQ5MTdiM2UzM2VmNmVlN2VjYjA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">A ship was more than just a ship after all, it was power. Power, and freedom, something she understood very well. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzg4Y2Q4OTI5ODRjZjhhYjdjOWYzODBmYmQ0MDIw"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MTA4MmY0M2Y4MjRiYjg5OTNlYzNmZDk4NDEwN2Uy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Katherine wowed us all with it. She’s always been good with technology, but I certainly never expected…” Mom had thrown an arm over my shoulder as she rambled, with me sitting she was just the right height for it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGU2MGE1NzU4ZTQ3OTJhZDdhYTBkMmVhMzhkNjJi"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NmQzNWZlYWUzOTQ4Zjk4MTNiNmY2MDkzODA5NTQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh I doubt anyone expected what young Katherine has put together. I find myself jealous of her talent as well. A nebula of talent.” Eugene complimented me, and Mom obviously liked that. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“She is. I’ve always wanted her to be something great, and she’s well on her way.” Mom said proudly, and then reached out and tugged on my cheek a little. “Now if only I could get her to care for the important things. You went to a University, didn't you Eugene?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did indeed, in fact. Filtborn, on Kellis. A fine institution.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“The best in all of the Kurtz Sector from what I hear. I’d love for Kat to get in.” Mom said, and I know what this was all about.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTZlOGJlM2ZlYTQzNGRiMmMzNzRlZjliZTJkOTM2"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMmE0MjYyMWJjNDQ4Mzk4ZDNkZGQyNzM0MmMzZWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mom. I’m not going to a University. I’ve got my ship, and I’m a Captain now.” I grumbled.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“A captain can still go to a University, and get an even better job, or a noble title.” Mom said, and I rolled my eyes. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDgxYmUwMjQ0MzQyNzVhZDRmYTc5MjY1Y2I3ODkx"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ODllMDEwNjAwNjRiZTk4ZmQ0YzY5ODJiOWMzNjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah! A difficult prospect, but for a girl that can forge her own ship perhaps possible.” Eugene said smiling, but he had sat back a bit in his chair, seemingly putting some distance between himself and the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDUyNTI1NmU3MzQyMzI4MGQ0YTE5YjM4NzY2ODFj"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ODE1ZTJmMjI2ODQ4OGFiMTI3OGM1YzMxMWMwNWE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rising to nobility wasn’t an easy task, and considering his position it was probably something he himself was working towards.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTZjNDkxYmM4YTRlYTFhMDY5OTM5ZGQxNzJhYjMy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YWYwZDNkODcxMjRiNWRiM2ViOTA0NDRjYTQ5MWIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I just had no interest in even trying to join that rat race. I had my ship, and I’d have the stars. I didn’t need land to call my own, or the title to shackle me as much as it would give me power.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjMzODBiYTQ4ZjQ4ODY5MmYyYWY3YWIwNmYyMmMy"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZjcxNTRmNzNiMzQyODI5NWM3ZjQyNDk4OTc4ZTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Power I just didn’t care about.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmNkYzI0NDA1YTRhMTc4MWFiMjkxMWFmOWNkNjQ4"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZmQwY2VhNzI0YzRlNTU4NDcwNTdjMDE3MzNiZjI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I could always contact my old Alma Mater, and see if they’d be interested.” Eugene offered, and I instantly sent him a death glare, telling him that he better not!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTc5YWVhYmJjZTQ0YjBhYmU0OGRjZGRmN2U4N2I3"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYzBkMzkyNjExMjQ1ZTdiM2MwZjRlZTU5Y2FjMmZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">He winked at me, as Mom went into a fluffy tirade about my accomplishments, and how well I would do at a university.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTE0Y2UwMTQ5MzQ0MWY4YzJkNjQyNDc1MTRmMzNk"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNzYyZmI2YmIyOTQxMjhiM2FhZmQyMDQ0MjY3Mzg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom was super embarrassing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWYxMTc1YjQzMjQxNTFhNGQ5MWQ4YWVjYjVmMjEy"> </p>
<p class="cnNmN2MyMmNmNzVmYzRiNDRiMDNiOWU2MWYyYzMxNGYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">—-</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzBiODNhMGZlYTQ1OThiZmRkYTRiZjVmZGY3ZjY4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0Mjk4NTM1NzZhNTQzMGM4OWE3ZTBlYTI5NjM5OTUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on baby, talk to me.” I whispered as I just closed my eyes and listened to the song. There was something wrong in the system, and despite fixing problem after problem, it felt like I only ever pushed the problem further away. What was I missing?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDU4Mjc3ZGFhMDRiMDk5YjQ3ZmMxYmY2ZjI1Y2Zh"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NDU1MTY3M2Q5YTQ5NGM5MDllMDBlMDQwZmIyNDMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The song chirped and swirled. Happy noise flowed through the ship even as every part of the song in part had some discordant note.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODQ0ZjFlNTJiMDRlZjRiNzg1ZjE0NmIxODA1ZWJj"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNDFiMzA2YmNhNjQ1NTBiZTM4MWFjZjk3YWZjN2Zi"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was working overall, the ship was flying, but there was always some part that wasn’t working.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzk4ZmEyODNmNjQ1NjQ5NWQ1ZDM1ZjZmODc4MWUz"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NDZmOTRjZjAwZDQ4YmQ4ZGI2NDE3YjlhYWZkNzk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt it then, a faint note that sounded off that was throwing off the rest of the melody, I turned and headed down the hall. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWU1NjVjZTI5ZDRmNzNhNGU5M2M3NDExMzhiMzlm"> </p>
<p class="cnNiODRiNGM5OWUyMjRkOTc5MzExZTE1NThmODBkMzgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now where was that? I continued on walking past Crabbit that were digging through the cabling along the walls and in the floors. Sparks were going off as they welded the ship together. Or fixed one thing or another.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTc3OGQ5NWRjMzRhZTJhOTY2NWFhZTA5YTZmOWI4"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZDY5NGI5MmMzNjRhNTc5ZGUyMmFmNGNhYTQwZThm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally I stopped and looked down.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzljNTY2NDYzMzRkYWY4ZDE0ZjczMGFjYmJiNmE5"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNjQ3NDc2NjViMjQ5YWQ4OGFiMDU1NjIyYzViNDg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head as I looked at the pile of cables and felt my eyes narrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTBkZGFkYWM5NDQ3YjliM2FjM2NkZWU0OGZjZTA2"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOWUxZDQ5MWZjODRjNjBhNzNlNzhkNzMwMDNlNmYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was wrong here? I reached down and ran a hand through the power lines and finally I felt it. Like an electric shock, as the discordant note ran under my fingers.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmN2YxNGQzMTRhZTQzN2JiODk0OGNiZjcyYWE5ZGU5"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NTlkOTM0N2RkYzRhYzA5ODkyODVjODA2NDc0MGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you broken?” I asked as I sat down and got comfortable, feet dangling into the open floor panel as I tugged up the cable and started looking it over. It looked fine. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDM0OTY2ZjczNjQwMWE4ZmU2NmVjZGQyZWFiNDVj"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MTYzMWY0YzU1ZjRiOTE5NmU1YzI2YmY1ODI5MjE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Crabbit, give me a power check.” I asked the shoulder Crabbit for the day. Watching on as it pressed a few tools against the place where the cable connected to another.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGEzMmRjNjYwNjQyZTg4OTc1MmFmOTE5NWE0MTI5"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMTEzMzc2N2M3OTQ2NGU5OGI4MzRiY2MyOTljMTcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Negative transfer! Error!” It called out and I hummed, bending down I looked through the tunnel where the cabling ran through. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTM1MDZjMDNhODQ1NWU5OTQwMTAzMjcyMmVjYzkz"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NjRmYTM1Yzk4ZDQ2NzBhZjc5YzNmZTM1MWY5YTQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go down and find the next connection node for this line, and check it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger roger!” It chirped and crawled over my shoulder and floated down to the crawl space before slipping inside.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMyMTUyYjRiYWViMDQzMTlhMjQ3N2UzNjAzNDY0MWVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Targets received! Received! Ten enemy ships! Oh no!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll be okay!” I called back, as my Tab filled with the data the Octavius sent over.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGQwNGY2M2JmYjRlMjFiMjVmZjY3Y2M2YTlkYTQw"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMTkzMDkyOTRlZDQ4ZTg5ZGRkYmQzNjBkOWEyM2Zi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ten enemy Pirates. Mostly Civilian retrofits. Lots of weapons and things but still just Civilian ships not really designed for combat. Weak to no armor, and a power system likely not designed to handle the load.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDMyOTcyN2ZiZTQ0YWU5NjM3ZjQ4MjJmMzgzNzU5"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMjVkM2QwZDgxZjQ5OWZiZTkzZmRmNmUxNzRkZjFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that strapping on tons of weapons on a ship made them less dangerous regardless.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Zjg2NDFmM2FmNTQxN2Y4NWY3YjFiNmYxMDQxOTZi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZTFmMTkwNWVhZjQ5YjI4ZDJmYjM1ODJjYWViMTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I stared out into the field of stars. The crystal glass view port was reactive. Even though I had only hooked up the most basic functionality. It still came alive, with sensor markings showing where things were. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTQwZWIxMWY0NTQyMmQ5OWU5MGJmODZiMmE2MTdk"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZjI0OWNhZDQ4YjQ5NzBiZDZkMTYyN2UyMTkyOTcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">While still a window, it was more like a massive Tab screen. I could even zoom in on things If I needed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjAyY2FjMzFkZDRkY2U4ZDM3OTlkNWVlZjcxMDky"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNWMxNWZhYzcxNTQ3OWNhMzdmNGUzMTlhNzJkMzU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The icons shifted as we moved, showing speed, and distance as best as the Phantom Star’s sensors could tell.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjZhNGZiMTFiMzQ0OTBhOWYxZDAzYWNjOGM0MTk4"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMjIwYzIwZDBmYzRkNmJhODk5N2UxOWUwMzAwODY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was already a lot of disruption. Chaff, either physical, or electronic was screwing up the numbers making them shift a little erratically.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMThjYzViOTFlZjQzZWJiMjk0ZDQ4NzYwZmUzODg1"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ODk2YTU0N2ZmZDQ4MGZhYzRkZDdmY2MyOGJkMDU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then most of them shifted, growing clearer and colors appeared as data from the Octavius was sent over. I now had my targets, as well as better information to work with.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWJlZDgxZGJjNjQzNjk4ODUyZDI3YzFiMjM4NjM5"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a dizzying amount of data especially since I was a complete novice, but I had AI specifically for this.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmFkMjFiMjExMzQ3ZGQ4ZWJjZTU1Y2MzYmQ0MDIw"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MDZkMmU1NzRmMjRmNDBiM2Q4NTAwZWI4OGQ5Mzc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Clear up the data, we’re focusing on just one at a time. Give me a firing solution for our target. And I need a double check of the Thermal Lance!” I demanded, and my Crabbit with their orders jumped to work. I could see the Thermal Lance charging up and I relaxed as it held power.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2M0NjcwYWFjODQyMmFhYzRiMDU5ZjZhMGZlMGU3"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NWJlNTBlNGYxMTQ4MTNiOWI2YmRjNjNkYzBiY2Zj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether it would fire accurately was another issue entirely.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDRlYWIyY2IwNTQwNjM5OTQwYjJmNzBmNjg1NDQ3"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YTIwYWI0OWMxYjQ3ZGM5NDJhZTFkNDU0YjVlOWU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had built the damn thing out of scrap parts, Nanopaste and dreams, and the laser emitters that guided the plasma volley were finicky.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWRkYWVkNDliNDRhNDRiNjcxYTQyNzRlZTE3YjBl"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYzhhZjcxZDJmYzQyNzQ4ZTI5ZDRlYmQxZDFlNjJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">While taking all that in, I noticed I was falling behind the Octavius a bit too much, and pushed the engines a bit harder.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDA1MzAxMzZkNjRhOTFiMzBhNTJiYTY5NDczNGFl"> </p>
<p class="cnNmY2EzOTcxZjRkMDQwZjViMzI2MTZjZDI5OGJlNDc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel the strain in the two nacelles as the acceleration felt sluggish.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjE3MjVlYzQ0NDRlM2E5NGJlMmM3ODk1ZmIwZDdl"> </p>
<p class="cnMwOGQ3Nzc3NWE0MzQ2NDg4OGI1Mzg2OWIwYWM3M2I4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring that I just focused on trying to keep up.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDE0MmZjMzFmMTRjZjBhMzJkNmFmMDM1ZjFiOGMx"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YzgyYWMwZTA2MDRlMDhhNjA2YmNjNWI3MzlmYWRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Warning! Warning! Hostile ECM detected!” I looked up and most of the targets seemed to glitch and shift just centimeters to the left and right on the viewscreen.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTMyMTdmNmRjYzRhNTM4ODc0Y2E0ZTkxYTUyM2Rh"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOGIxNjcwZjM0NDQ4ZDI4ODNmOGRkMjVkMThjYzli"><span style="font-weight: 400">That didn’t seem like much, but in space that difference was more than enough to be immune to retaliation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Njc0OTU3MDI0ZDRhNTZhOWRmYWU0NzdjZWEyMTRh"> </p>
<p class="cnMxN2IzYWViN2U3OTRmMTk4MzNhMTE4ZThmNTA2YTFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">One of those ships had serious ECM systems. Which made perfect sense for a group of pirates.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTFiZmI2ZTA2YzRlZGQ4ZmRiNjhiZWZmNWY4MGVh"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YTVmYjczOWU1OTQ4MDNiZDdlOTliZDQxNzNjM2Mx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Octavius is responding! Good good!” The same Crabbit on sensors called out, and I noticed the glitching mostly went away. Obviously the electronic warfare specialist on the Octavius was fighting back. Would the Octavius, being a military vessel, overpower these pirates on that field as well?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzIwOTdjYzk5NzRlNTBiOWIxMGE5MDNhMTZlM2Fi"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNGZkZmQzNGY1NTQyMWFiOWI2NDAyMzJmMTg1MTli"><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, I’d say yes, but pirates are pirates, attacking vessels is their speciality and you need someone skilled to jam comms and make sure even a civilian vessel can’t call for help.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2FhMDY5ZGI3MDQzNWFiNWQxZjViOTMyMWM0MTk1"> </p>
<p class="cnMxY2MxN2I4NGU5MDQ0YjE4NmFkZGY5ZGQ5Njc4M2Y4"><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was still enough interference to make accurate long range shooting pointless.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzdiOWM3OWMzOTQ0NDM5ZWZhMTdmZWRkYzdlY2M2"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNTQzMGM5MmM5MzQwNWNiZTQ5ZTc5OWM4N2UzODQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gather a few hands and sync up. I want to make sure our target is a clear shot!” I called out, and nodded with that done. A few Crabbit floated in not long after and joined up with the sensor Crabbit, tying themselves together to try and clear up the interference for the perfect shot.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjZjZDU3ZjI5YzQwZTg5NDA2ODFiYjYwNDI3YzY1"> </p>
<p class="cnM4N2QyOGRhZjBjOTQ0NThiNDM4NTdhOTg3Mjg2NWY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The targets cleared up a bit more, but every few seconds it would glitch out again before clearing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjgzMTg4MGZiNjRkNDM4NTE4OGUyZDFmZDhlZTI5"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZDZkNDUxNjBlZjQxNDk4MGNlMDUwMzBkNDYwZjRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone on the other end of that ECM knew what they were doing. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDJlOGE1ZTJlYzQwMDZhOTViNDU3YWM1NGIxM2Iz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNjcwNTY3YzY1OTQwZTg4ZjY3YTJhZWRmODU5ODU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath in and out. I wasn’t an electronic warfare specialist. I knew about as much as anyone that used Tab’s and other computer systems in this age knew. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzQ5OGJlZDA2ZDQ5NWI5OTY5NWI5ODAzMzhiOWUz"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ODFmNDNiNzI3YzQ1MWJhNDdiZDMwNjlkMDFiOTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which was nothing when it came to that level of high end warfare.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjM2YWE3NDg2ZTQ2NDJiMDE5NGI2NWM5NDEyYzRj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZDU1MzdhYzNiZTQzNWJhNTU1OGIzNDEwNzE3NDcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d just have to hope that the Octavius had someone a bit more specialized, and the Crabbit could help…</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzg2OTRmNzI3MzQ3Yjc4NzgzNjEzZGMyNDAwNTBl"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNjgyNWI1MDA1NzQwYzliZDUxOWEzODZjNmNjODFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Crabbit. Try to connect to Octavius's electronic warfare specialist. See if you can work with them.” I didn’t know if the person in charge would even want to work with a young AI but I would ask.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjJiNDcxNWQ3MjQwYTE5ZjBlM2ZkM2RiMDI2Yjlj"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OTg2ZGQ1YzcyMzQ3NmE4MGVkOTMxYTkzMWUzZDFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Better than just leaving it to the Crabbit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjY3ZDJhZmY1NzRhMTM4OWRjOTY2NTY2YTM0MDcw"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact was, they weren’t the best at learning something from scratch. Sure I could teach them, and they’d pick it up quickly enough, but they were still like children, and would make mistakes, or get distracted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjRhM2UwYmFjZDQ2OTFiNTFmNmU1M2QwYWRiYmIw"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MDdiYjYwNmQxNTRiYTg4ZWVkZDQ2YmMzYjNhYzYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Or just have pure misunderstandings on what to do like they did with the navigation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjgzMmI4NWQ2MzRiN2U5NDM1OWVhOTMxMDVkNzJi"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYTBlOGQ0MmQwMTRjYWRhYzA3ODNiM2ZkNjJhNTM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Putting that out of my head. I noticed the distances grow closer and closer, and set to work.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmNkNTU5OGQzODQzODY4MzBmOTk5MWI2MDliNGVj"> </p>
<p class="cnMxODdlZWZiZDg0YTQ5NjViOTdkYTNhNTU4NmVmNjA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Firing solution!” I demanded and the Crabbit responded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWExMGI2NmZkNTQ0NmE5NzlmMzg0ZmRjM2NjZDYw"> </p>
<p class="cnNhOWUxODkxMmFmOTQ2MDY4NmRmMDhjODMxZjA1MjA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Null! Null!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjFmMWY1ZjQ5NDQzMjVhZDZiZjExMGQwOGMzMDkz"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NGJmM2UwZGI0OTQyZWZhMTczZDMwNmZkZDI1NTNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Too far still. But I urged them anyway.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2Q5ODliZjhjNjRhOGNiMDI3YjdhZTI2OGYyZmRl"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get me a solution anyways, Keep it updated. Try to ignore incorrect responses from the ECM.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWM1ZmM3ZGE5MjQxMDM4NGQzOTcwMDQ4NWM4N2Zl"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYmM1YmM4YjAzYTQ1MDZhMDA2NDRiZDgwOWEyNjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm. Okay! I’ll do it!” The Crabbit at the tactical station called out. The reason I had put this one on weapons was because it was a bit aggressive and willing to try things even without fully correct data.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNThiNjE5NGYyMDQ1MzI5MDRjYTY3ZWMxZjM4ZWQx"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOWI0MDZkYWIxZjQyNzA4YjRhYWFmMmZkZGY4OTM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The creation of the Diamond Drive had caused a few of the Crabbit to become a bit more experimental.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjExM2JjNmFkNzRiMDZiOTdmOTdiYzdlODRmMWVh"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNDNiNDJkNWIwYzQyNmI4NzRmNWUyMzAyODI4MThm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not something entirely safe, but it had its uses.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWJiMDdkMjZjODQzN2I4ODM0MGFiMmU3MzIyMjIy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NzliMzg3MGQwOTRhNTQ4MDk4NDg4ZWY4YjJiNjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Warning! Enemy fire detected!” I quickly tabbed the throttle to give myself a shifting trajectory and jerked to the port. The ship shifted to the right altering our course, where we would be. And then I waited.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2NjMGY4NmI4ODQwMGFhNjFjNDQwOWI4YmI0N2Y3"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NmFkOGY5ZTlkZTQyMDg5MTcyNTkwZTNkZTc3MDhi"><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, I saw the attack. A laser shot passed, I watched in fear as it wiggled a bit trying to confirm our location at such a distance and with the ECM of the Octavius hiding us, and then it ended.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2RhMGFkYTFhNTRhZWE5NzQzMjkxZDFkOTU5MGNl"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZDA3NWU2OGJmZDRiNjE5MGNiNDBjZTdjZmU5MWUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was scary. Especially since it was invisible to the naked eye, only my Crystal Glass viewport highlighting it even let me see it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTE5YzcxMmVlMzQ0YTFiNjZmOTBjMDRiYTc5OTk4"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZWVmZjc4MjhkODQ0MTQ5NWRmM2Q0YzFjZTdhYjAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">It could also dim the beam in case someone got smart and decided to try and flash fry someone's eyes with a high visibility laser. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjODMwZmU3N2RmZjQwMTBhZDViOTQ1Njg1NWQ1YThm"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMmIyNDI3ZDRhMTRkYzQ4N2JhZTdiN2MyMWY4YzQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No hit! Evasion successful!” I felt my heart pounding, as I started adding some evasive maneuvers into my flight plan. It set me even farther behind the Octavius, but they had added some maneuvers to their flight as well, not that it slowed them nearly as much as It did me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDhkYjU2MGNiZTRjZmRiZDFmMmU1OGVlZmI1Yzk1"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YmNkYTFmOWIxNzQ1YTc5YzYzNmJhZTY1MjFjOTZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s fine.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWM3ZjU1OTFlYTQ4ODk5Y2QxMTcxZTFmNTFmYmUw"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZTAzMzQ1YzlmOTQ1NGZhMWE4NmNjZWE0OWZmMGMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was backup, they were the main thrust here.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTEyMDA4OTRkMjRlNjA4NTg0Y2JhNWMwZjdkYWMx"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNWY5MWQ2MmI4NTRjZGRiODNkMDQ0ZDIwYWI4YzJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the target lights on the view port shifted color.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjllNWE2NTRkMTQ5ZDY5MmI4NjZmODEwZTg2OWY2"> </p>
<p class="cnMwODZjMzY2OTIwMDRhNmRiN2Q1MDU1MzhlY2FhYjMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Range was getting close enough for combat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODgyNDIxZjg1ODQ0OGQ4YWU0YmUxZDIzNzY3YTJi"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MmZjYzBhYmIyYjQ3ZWFhZjRjN2I0OTZmNDNlM2Fi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shifting to Engagement speed, get me a firing solution!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Processing processing, accuracy!” I wanted to laugh as next to the target marker the Crabbit added a little percentage which was their assumed accuracy. I watched as the number went up, but every shift in the Phantom, or the enemy maneuvering caused the number to drop.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODMzNTMwZjVhYzQ3Yzc4MzAyMjc0YjA5NjlhZGQw"> </p>

A dozen beams of directed energy lashed out, all of them focused on one or two ships to try and weaken shields for when we got closer.</span></p>

The much smaller ships that were struck by the Octavius’s Plasma Cannon had their shields flare first blue then purple, and red, and then they popped like soap bubbles. The moment they did, secondary cannons or lasers struck them, carving into their hull, and when weapons struck the pirates hull there was little resistance.</span></p>

Each of them opened up the bay doors. Sacrificing any hope of armor to rely on the shields, but within each of the modules was missile rack after missile rack.</span></p>

I couldn’t comprehend how many credits they were shooting away, but I suppose, if they thought they’d have access to a broken frigate, and an entire sector afterwards for long enough to hit the station and more. It would probably be worth it.</span></p>

Each barrel of the Thermal Lance was actually three laser batteries, it made a sort of triangle shape as the three emitters all connected their beams into a single shaped beam. The point was to create a path within the shape of the lasers that was perfect for Plasma to propagate through without deteriorating.</span></p>

The armor had shifted to a bright red and then white, as it was boiled off as the plasma struck first the metal plates and then into the much weaker decks below. It pumped out the other side as a fireball of plasma having lost all the coherence the Lasers gave it, but that was already overkill.</span></p>

The Octavius listed a bit, as its shields hadn’t managed to survive the brutal missile barrage, but then as the attack was over. The trained crew took over, shifting the ship to try and protect that side of it from the pirates as they continued attacking. The Octavius started lashing out angrily in return.</span></p>

I couldn’t help but smile at their delight. I should be like them happy that I had won, had survived, but I only felt a pit in my stomach at the fact I had killed people.</span></p>

We’re to escort you.” One of them offered, surprisingly kindly and I relaxed, it wasn’t a secret boarding action then.

I almost didn’t step off but the guards both stepped out and looked at me, so I followed. Onto the bridge of an actual warship. </span></p>

Thank you for protecting the station.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s my duty. But it was not yours. You saved my ship today, from that surprise freighter.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was an easy shot for me.” I demurred.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Regardless, my life was in your hands for a moment. I won’t forget that fact. Now onto business before pleasure. Hamlin?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sir.

Four is better than none.” The Baron offered and turned to me. “Under wartime standards, the transfer of equipment is clear, but I am not a miser, all of this is likely to end up at the same place regardless. Two of the wrecks will be yours to do with as you please. As long as what you please is handing them over to your home station.” He offered, and I realized he was joking a bit.</span></p>

I noticed you relied entirely on your armor?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… The shield emitters weren’t ready. So I only had my deflector.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You went into combat without shields?” The officer, Hamlin, beside me spoke and looked up at me, and I sort of shrugged. “You’re either foolish, or mad. Perhaps both. But in this case I’ll thank you for your madness.” He said and I blinked at the surprisingly… Kind compliment? Insult?</span></p>

It’s my own design.” I offered smiling happily. “It’s a bit complicated, but I figured out a good method to produce and repair it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! I was hoping to ask about that!” A new voice appeared behind us and I turned and offered a smile to the man, mostly in relief at a familiar face. Eugene was walking across the bridge in a power walk. “My dear, you simply must tell how you decided on an ablative design!”</span></p>

Now Artemis tells me the ship won’t be ready in case of another fight?” He asked, and Eugene the Engineer shook his head. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmZiMmQ4YTE2OTRmMWZiYzczY2Y5YTkyZThlYjZk"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“She needs some real attention, my Baron. That missile barrage cracked her hard. She’s nearly bent out of shape. We can limp back to the station, but I do mean limp.

I should be able to? My Deflector is still functional, as far as I know.” I muttered the last part, because the Phantom hadn’t come out unscathed.</span></p>

Then as the Noble Authority in the Sector. I sign off on these two ships to your holding. The credit stipend will be transferred soon.

Eugene, do leave her be for now.” He added instantly as the Engineer looked like he was about to jump on me for a chat. I hesitated, but in the end, I tapped on my Tab that I pulled out to trade comm frequencies. Who knows if I might need his advice for something. He was a chief engineer.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwMjY0NGU3ZTQyNDQwYzFiMWRhZGE2ZmExOGFiMjNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">And now her face was full of worry lines as she looked at me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWJkMGI4OWMzNDQ0MmU5YWZmZTlmZDI3NTdkOTRh"> </p>
<p class="cnMwOGUxYzM2MmY0NDQ1OGI4OGM4ZDhmM2MwMzA1ZTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are.” She said her face shifting into a gentle smile. “My little builder. So good with her hands, not so good with her heart. I never wanted you to get into this sort of trouble. You might have the body of a soldier, but your heart was always so gentle.” She reached out and ran a cool hand over my cheek, wiping some tears along with it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTA0YjhlY2IyZDQ0NmU4OWIxMzdhYThhYjNlYmJl"> </p>
<p class="cnM2Yzk4MWMzMTFmZTQyMjY5MjZlY2M2MTdlZWEyNzVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not gentle.” I grumbled a little petulantly, I was big and strong!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTVhZDY4NjI3YTQ2MDg4MTY2OWE4OWVhMTc0NjRj"> </p>
<p class="cnNmY2NkZmU1ZTFkMjQyMTJiYTJlOWExZjA5MjVjNGM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have your father’s gentleness. I was happy about that, you know? That you didn’t get my own coldness… But maybe you need your mother’s words right now. You didn’t do anything wrong. I’d rather you kill those pirates a thousand times then ever put yourself in danger. You want to be a captain my little engineer. Fighting and killing is part of it.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM5NjBkY2Q5ODUxZDQxMWZiZmI4ZDg1YTU1MzhlN2Ex"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know.” I said, but I looked away because… I hadn’t been ready for it. I thought I would have more time, that I’d end up killing pirates eventually, but that it wouldn’t bother me. I should be okay with this!</span></p>

It was weird that despite knowing I had another Mom at another time, it hadn’t really changed my connection with this woman. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWJjM2JhOWU1MTQ0ZGFhMGQxNWNiODdlOGRiNWY0"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNWUyZjNlZjBhZTQ1YzQ5MWJjMTQ5NDdjYmZjZDQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">She had still done all the baby stuff with me, and there was a part of me that always felt that connection even now.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3OTdjMDk0ZjViNTQzYjc4MjdlZjdjMzExYmRlMTBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you could do it again would you run away?” Mom asked then and I instantly shook my head. </span></p>

<p class="cnM1NTk4YmYxY2ZiYjRkYzZiNTE1ZmFmN2VkMGU1MGZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then it sounds like you did the right thing. Did the only thing you could do. Don’t be ashamed of yourself Kat. You saved not just all the men on the Baron’s ship, but the station too. Trust me. I would not like to find myself at the mercy of pirates. I’m proud of you. For fighting.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess.” It was a lot to take in, a lot to process.

<p class="cnM1OGUyM2NkNWVhMzRiMWU5ZjUxOTc0MTU3OGNiZjEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pass me that, would you?” I asked, pointing and the Crabbit chirped as it brought forth the tool I needed. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDZkNDRiZDY5MTRhZmE5YTg0Yjc3ODJlNTQ4NTJk"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNmE5NDg2MDI3ODRhZDViNWJhMTc1NDJmODU1N2M5"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was easy to forget that tools could drift off in the depths of space.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmJkMTI2ZGY3NzQ2NDc5NzY0M2Q1MGE1Y2ZkMGU4"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZTkxNDk1YjQzNzRkY2ZhOWZhNGE1MTc1ZGU5NmIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was on the hull of one of the ships that had been given to me, peeling shield emitters out of the hulk.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWNmMGEyNDIyZDRlYjBiNjRhZWE0ZjM4YTY1OGNm"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ODQ4ZTk4NDIwNDQ5NThiMzU4YzU3ZGNhMmQzNDU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a simple repetitive task that I could have left for the scrappers who would have done the same thing, or even the Crabbit.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDNmYjE0MGRmYTRhNzU4YmU2Mzk3ZDE2Y2Y2ODY3"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMmVkOWQ5ZTEyOTQ4NDk5MWYwNGExODM3MjcyMDAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">But I needed to do something with my hands.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDE3YzQ4YWRkOTRmMDI4ODcyOTdkYjNmYzdlMWFj"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">That and the depths of space gave me all the solitude I needed to simply stop thinking.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTNiZmJhOWJkNTQ5NTRhYTJjZjBlNDBhYzliOWE1"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYWRkODU3OTNkOTQ0ZjBiNDc0ZjVlYmQ0MGJjYmI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hefted one of the emitter strips. The section was forty or fifty emitters, each of them about a foot across and connected together. I finished rolling up the strip and the Crabbit I was with grabbed the bundle and flew it away.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTlmNTQ4NjQ3MDQ1YWRiNTQ3MGFlMjJlMDg3YzMy"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMmEzYzEyOGFmZTQyMjZiZWE3MmUzMDJhZWQxN2Uz"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the last of them. I rolled over so I wasn’t on my knees and just put my ass to the cold ship and looked out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWUyMjNjZDYyZDQzMTE4ZGZlZDQ3MmNkZWI2NjMz"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYzhiZDM2NTFlZTQ4ZDRhMGUxN2Y2NzIzNGY3NjZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ships were all around me, shuttles flying around as they took parts that had been scrapped back to the station.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmJjNjMyZTYzZjRiZWQ5NmI2NDk5ZDkzYjIxN2Vk"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOTVmYzhmNWZmNjQ1MTNhOTRlOTE4NDcwNzc0MDdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I could switch to the open comm channel and listen in to all the voices that would be chattering away. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTc3NTgwYThlNDQ1OGY4N2UyY2MzZTZhODFmMWNm"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYzgyZDE2Mjc3YTQ1ZGY4N2FmM2I2MGY1NGU0MmY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">No doubt Aunt Sheila’d be cussing out someone for not doing it right, while Great Uncle Kyle would cut in every few minutes with updated orders for some work groups.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2U2ZTM1ZTlhMTQ0ZWY4ZjI0OTMxOWM4MTQ4YTc1"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NWZmMGFmMWIzMDQwZGE5OGI4OWQwMDNiYzNjMjRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">But I was alone and I wanted that right now. My Comm was firmly off. The Crabbit on my shoulder would alert me if there was an emergency message.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGEwMjVmMzMyYjQzNzE4M2MxYTJkMWMwYjllMDUw"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZTUxNThlYTc0NzQyNDU5NjM3MmFkOGFmYjZlY2Qw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had killed people. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmI2NTA2MTRkMzRhMmFhMDliYzliYzY2ZTIzMGM4"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZDBmZTI1ZTgxZTQ3NWI5MzFhYjM0YWMwOWVlYWQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn’t been able to resist slipping into the hulls to see the damage. To see the corpses floating around. Many of them turned into smears on the walls, or worse.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTM4MmYyYTA3YjRhZDRhN2IwMGIwODE0YTE4Mjk1"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMjg0NWMyYjIyYzQ1MzM4MjAyNmMwOGY2NDQ3OGY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">They would have killed me, I knew that. Pirates weren’t kind. They were hunted by nearly everyone so to be a pirate was to accept that you weren’t like other humans anymore. Mom’s voice in my ear reminding me that I did what I had to, didn’t make the surge of discomfort go away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWI2YjVlYWJjYzQyOThhNzcyM2Y1NDI0ZTg3NzA5"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZDRiYjk1OTY1ZDRlOTg5NzdmMWFkZmE2Y2U5YTYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">And I had killed them. I shook it off, and rose back to my feet, a few bouncing steps and I was off. I’d find another shield emitter section on another ship and peel it off. The more of them I found, the better. I might actually get some working shields for the Phantom Star.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmRkMGZhYzA2ZTRlMWQ5YTg3N2VlOGU5Njc0OGRh"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OTczNGMwZWVkNzRiMjRhNDhmZjg0M2U1MTdlMDM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">My poor ship. She was scarred and damaged after the battle. The Crabbit were doing their best to do minor repairs, but I needed time to get enough nanopaste I would need to repair the armor.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTRhN2Y0MWE3NDRhZDM4NDYwNjNjMzY3ODFjM2Fk"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMjkxNmYwZjU0ZDQxZTNiN2IzZjI5NDYyMTg3Mjg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">But then I needed to strip these ships, and get the shield emitters. Or pull out the Iris Drives riddled throughout the ships. Every Iris Drive I could get my hand on was another step closer to maybe making an even bigger Diamond Drive.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjM3OWRmODMxYjQxNmY5ZjFhODE4MTM4ZGEzOGY2"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NzFkYzg3ODJhZjQxYzY4YWFiNDZlMTgwMGU2YWQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a bigger Diamond Drive, I could finally finish the Phantom, and have more than just a main gun, but I needed to do repairs first in case the pirates came back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWU1MzVkZGQyYTQzNmQ5Zjg4ZTgzNzk4NTgxNDg1"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NjA2MTNjMDQxMTQ1MDViMWZlYzljNGRiOTFhYTE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">As I floated through space for a moment I slumped. The work felt endless, and I was pretty much doing it alone with just the Crabbit. Everyone on the station was super busy, and I didn't really want to ask for help either.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzYxYjkzMGY5MDRhYzY5YjRlYTcxOTAxYWVmM2E3"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMGU1YTE3YzcyYzQ1NTU5ZTI5MmY5MzgzNTkxYzJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Octavius was claiming any mechanics that weren’t stripping ships to help. So it was just me and the Crabbits, and the Phantom Star which I needed to prepare for potentially another fight. The pirates' assault had failed, they had fled, but if they realized how badly the Octavius was damaged, they might get enough nerve to try again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjRmYTNlOGE2MjQxYmE5ZjQzYjI0YWRlYjMyMzA3"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ODRiY2M2MmY1NzQwYzk5MDU3MTc0OWQ1YmYzMmJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">So here I was taking some alone time trying to fix my ship, and not think about all the blood I now had on my hands.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Nzg5NWM0OTRlMzQ2YTU4MDcxNGNjZTYzOWViYTk5"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZGFjZjViMmYzZjQ3ZTY5YjY5NjQ2MGE1NzU2MGRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I wiped my hands on my coveralls and kept going. Another strip of emitters needed to be peeled off and sent over to the Phantom.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjQxNGRkODBlYzRkMmNhZjdkOGJkYzZlZWNjYTli"> </p>
<p class="cnM1N2M3ZTFhMDBkOTQ1ZmE5MjVjYjNhM2QwMzcyODE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Always more work to do.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDg4MWM0NGVlNzQ2MWVhZThjODg5YTJlM2E1NmZh"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZmY4OTE1OTFjMDQzZjNiZDhjMmFlM2RmZjVhNjU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDhlZDU1NGQyYTRiYjZiZGFmOWRjNzFlMjczYzU3"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OGI5MjE5ZDA3YTQ0M2E5ODE5ZGYwMWU3NDhmYzU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go ahead and send some power through.” I called to the Crabbit at the control console.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmJhMDQ4OWZhNDRlY2ViMTJkODllMjI5MGU2NTcz"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NjdkYzM4ZmU1NzRlMGJhYzA5YmRiYzcwODk4NTJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unlimited Power!” It cried out, which… I mean, that wasn’t wrong but wasn’t the right time to say that. I’d have to talk to them about that… Wait the only place they would have heard that line is from me… Shoot. Need to watch the old references a bit more.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTYyZWRmYzhmYjQ5YjE5ZGFiODc3MTM1YmQwMmY0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YjBmM2RiM2YyYzQzMzM5MjlkN2I5OTZiYjBjYjI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly the status screen on the Tab connected to my shitty captain's chair updated, and a bubble started forming around the Phantom. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTgzZTFlNzhiMzRkM2U5NTJhNjAyNjRjNDIxNDA3"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDU1N2QyYTNmMjQ1MDY4OWZlYmI5MWUyOTk2ZWZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Outside the viewport space rippled as the Shield manifested, before going back to normal as it returned to invisibility.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDJjYjM2YjJhODQyNzhhYmZiMDY5YTI5YTdhNDQ0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NzAwZWU3Nzk4MTRkNDQ4OWM3M2IzYTA3MDM3ZWNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it held. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTU1ZmVlMmEyMjQ1YTFiM2Q4MjJjM2Y4OTRmN2Ni"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMWM0MzA2ZDU0MDQ1YjNhYWM0ZDJiY2YyYzg4ZDg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Any problems?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Starboard B2 emitter has failures! No good, no good!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, we’ll go check them out after. Run me through the tests.” I called out and nodded as the Crabbit restarted the shield just to see if there were any other failures.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjhhZTQ5OGMzZjQ5ZmNhN2IwYTU1NDZkNjQyZTc3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkY2RlNzM2Yzc4NjQyZWQ4OGM5NDE4YWFkZDQyMDA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up with a groan and headed out of the bridge, down the ladder and into the main floor, then I headed down a ways towards quarters in the center of the ship, and then climbed down another emergency ladder, this one was much longer until finally I hit the bottom of the cargo bay.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTZlOGFjYmNmOTRkZWE4Y2E0YjYxZGJiMWYzZjg3"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YzI0YTI4M2E3NTQ4Yzc4ZWRlNWJmYzFiYmI0MTg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How’s it coming?” I called out looking over the cargo bay where a chunk of debris, almost entirely armored hull, was floating freely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDkyYWI4OTdiYTQ4N2FiNjRmZDMwNWMwYzc2MGYw"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZGM5YTI2MmExNTQ4ZmU5ZmZiYWJkMGM0OTEzMWY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“80 percent!” I got shouted back and I nodded. Below the massive chunk of armor were multiple Nanopaste vats. I had an idea for where I was going to place the vats to hook them into the repair system that would spray Nanopaste onto sections of armor when it was needed, but while the sprayers were working, there just wasn’t enough space in the little hidey hole to make this much nanopaste. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjNlMGEzYmM0NTQ1MWQ5YjMyNzRjNDMyNDhhZDI4"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NDI2Mjk1M2JlNjRiNDM4Y2FhNzk0NDBkN2U1ZWE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">A bit of a design issue I hadn’t considered. So it was all out here in the hangar. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGU4YzUyMWE3ZDRkMTc4MzY1MGQxNjM3ZjE1MWJi"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNWUwODc0MjljMTRhZjZiYzkxMWZiNWMxYTVlNDM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The nanopaste below the scrap bubbled as the Crabbit guided another section of the hull into the paste where it would be eaten and used to create more paste.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWUwODM1M2M1NzQzYjFhMzJkZjgwNTg5NjRiZTU5"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYjY5ZGM3N2E2MzQ0NmRhYmQ4M2U2MjllNTMxNjVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">More and more was being constructed, hopefully enough to repair the armor and more.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTczNjIwYmIwZDQ5OTM5OGM3ZTE2NjkzZDY4MmMx"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNzNiNzNkNDg1NjRjYTA5YzAyOTUwZmY4MDEwMjUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nodding at that, I turned to the other object resting in the hangar. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmZiYzFlMTQwOTQ2NGQ5MGRiN2I5MDE4NDg3NWMy"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNjAyZTk2ODlhYzQ2ODU4ZTc3ZDc0NWEyNWQxM2U0"><span style="font-weight: 400">A Medium Iris Drive.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmFiOGY2MmRmZTQyNzc5ODQ0ZjdiNDAxODdmOTc0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZjY3MDAwMWFlNTQ1MjU4OWUwNGZiMTRlNjJjN2Iz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The power output of that Drive was around my Diamond Drive, it alone could basically power the Phantom, and get us moving. Unfortunately I would need another six medium sized drives to make it into another Diamond Drive. A bigger, much more powerful Diamond Drive.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjAzOTcyYmRlNjQwMmNiOWQ1OWRjZGUyZjBiODI5"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZGJhNTlmMGRiYTQ5ZTdiMTUzNmExOGZhYTUyYjNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">But while that was the goal, it was an unfortunate fact that I wasn’t anywhere near that for now.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTdlMTcwNjk1YjRjMDdiYmM1NjIzOTc5MTI0YjM4"> </p>
<p class="cnMwM2Y3OTVkY2Y4ZTRmMzg5NzIwNjdlYmVhNTllZjQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead I was going to trade it for more supplies for the Phantom, of course that doesn’t mean I wasn’t going to use it to massively upgrade the Phantom while I was at it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmIxZjNiN2RhZjQ2YjM5ZGEyOTFhNWU1OTg2NTRl"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MjcxYmE5NjU3ZDRkMDU5MmM5NGYwODgxMzAyODg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The current Diamond Drive that was powering the Phantom was made up of seven Small Iris Drives. The sort of drives that would normally power small equipment. Space suits, the Crabbit, for instance, were powered by Small Drives. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmNmNTIyNWMyNzRlZTdiOTVlYWM1M2E3ODQwMzBj"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NjVlOGM3OTY5OTRhOGJhMDc1MzdiODgxZTMzNjU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The shuttles we flew around with were powered by Small Drives, but that was mostly because we weren’t rich enough to afford high end shuttles with a bit more power.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjliOWQ5OTIxMTQ2ZDdiZWNmNzJiYjZlNTkxZjkz"> </p>
<p class="cnM0N2FlOWI0ZDU4MjQ5YzM5MmExOTA3MGQzZmFjYzE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily in space a small amount of motion was all that was really needed to get around.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTRlMWY4ZTdiMDQwNDk5NTQzMDNlMTNjZjA2NTYy"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZThlOTg0OTU2MzQ4MmRiOTQyYWVjZmQwZmFkM2Yy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven Small Drives in a Diamond, was a bit stronger than a Medium Drive, but the Diamond Drive was basically exponential with the power sources. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjljNDc5MjE2NzQxN2VhMDBjOTg0M2E5M2ZlMmJi"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMjUyMWI2MDAzODRjM2Y5NzcxY2RlMzM1ZGFlODU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">There were more sizes of Drive. Light Iris Drives were a step up from small, something usually used for High powered Shuttles, or if a Sector used Fighter craft. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjk2ZGQzNzI3OTQ4MmQ5MmJhZGNmOGE1MDUwNjVi"> </p>
<p class="cnM0OTVkZmYwNzNiNjQzYzhiZjc1MjMzMmMzZDZhMjA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were well outside any hope of me purchasing one normally. If someone had a Light Drive, then they had the ability to Warp at least a shuttle out of a sector. If you could travel, then you were already pretty rich.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjE1NDczZWQzZTRmYTU4YzVkZmQxZThjMzU5MTU1"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMWFhYTk5YmVlOTQ1MjA4YWM5NTg5NTdiZDQzODEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">But, a Medium Drive was far more valuable than even seven Light Drives. </span></p>

<p class="cnNlZTQ1NjQyZjJmYjRkOTliOGNjZTFmNTcwNmUzMmI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Contact with the enemy.” Artemis spoke and he shifted his thoughts. Hamlin was already working, giving the Phantom Star data, while attacking the pirates computers and systems, hopefully… Hopefully it would be enough.</span></p>

<p class="cnM2MTJjNDk0OTYxYjRiZjliMGZmYzVlOTZhNWUyMmRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Five ships. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmY4ZGRmZWJkMDQ1ZDJiZDU0NjgwNWExOTJiNWM1"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMTY3ZDg5MzE4OTRkMmJiNWQ2NmRkOGEyMzBkOTM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The twinkling of their engines in the distance glinted in space, it was a beautiful image for the danger it represented. They drew closer and closer, coming to kill me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWY1MDJkY2IwOTQ0NmVhYzNlZGJjMmI4ODhjNWM0"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MWMyMWUyNmQ1NTRhNDU4ZWYzMmQ5ODdkZDRhNmZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I tore my eyes away from the viewport, and towards the Tab at my side that had a map of the system, and the estimated ranges of all of our weapons.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjRhNDMyNDMzYzQwYjg4Y2YyZjMxZWY3YmI1YTk2"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYWViMWVhYTFkODRjY2U4MzhmNjE2Nzk4YzY0MDJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I needed to bring the pirates into range of not just the static defenses, but the Octavius, and do it without losing too much of my ship in the process.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzFiM2UwN2YxMTQ1NzRiNDZiMmY3NTc0ZjkwNjcw"> </p>
<p class="cnMzODNjMWZjZGUxMzRmNmVhNWNkMTRlZjAxZDBlODFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The math was clear. I should lose this fight. The Phantom Star just wasn’t complete enough for this. I was confident one or two of the ships would be dead before this fight ended, but that wasn’t nearly enough before they tore me apart. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDk2ZjBhNTk2OTRiODA5YzI3NjgxOTNiYTcxY2Yx"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YTg5Y2Y2NzM0MjRiZjg5MjNhYTY4NTZiOTM1ODIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, I had to try. This was my home, and more importantly, I had some things on my side. The pirates missile boat was gone, and the rest of the pirate ships we had some data for. The Octavius was sending me constant updates of what weapons each of the ships had used in the previous engagement, and already the data was coming in…</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGIxNmE2YTgyMTQ1ZmFhYjdkMTNiOTkyNDZiNjUx"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMmUxOGM0Nzc0ZjQ5NGNhOWJlNmM3ZDg5MGVkNjQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hard Starboard!” I demanded without looking up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmZiZmE5ZWRhYjQ5YjBiNGVjMmFiYWQ0YjJkYWI3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZTM0YzAxMjYwODRlNjY5NmUyZGUyYWI4OGQ2MGI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I would switch to a broad side and try to drag them into the missile satellites, but more importantly, the ships on that side of the pirate formation had lighter weapons…</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODBiOTAwNGFhMzQ3YjE4YTAxNmMzM2QwNDNiNzRi"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YzNiYjA2NzZjNDQ3MDQ4MmI2MzQ1ZDA5ZDYyYzhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">It would have to be enough.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTY1YmU3MDMwOTQ1YjJhOGFjMDM0MmVjOTVhZGY3"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMzcyZDlhMTRmNzQ0ZGNhMGY5ZjUwZjY0MmJjYzk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have the power, as soon as they are in range, start shooting the Thermal Lance’s lasers, a lucky hit is still a hit.” I called out, and the Crabbit in charge of the weapons immediately grumped at me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTViNzFiZTQ5YTRkZGM5OWZkMWNjMjQxYjk3ODYw"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s bad Math! Bad Math!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just percentages.” I replied knowing how to handle her. “A low percentage shot, still has a chance to hit right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmmm. Bad Math!” She grumbled back, but I could see the turret shifting already.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTM5MGQ3NTYwZjRlOWI4MzYxN2Y3NTgwM2I3MzUx"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YWU1MzZmZTRlYzQ4NmZiNzg1MjUxODdlYjIyYTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Good girl.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzNmOGFiYWY2MzQ2MjQ4ZTNmOWIwZDI3MzMwZTM0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMDI1N2IwMzEyMDQ0ZGZhMGI4ZjFiMDBmYTk1MmQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I was in position I kept the engines at a solid 90% throttle. It would hopefully give me some leeway to speed up or slow down if I need to, but I needed the pirates to think I was prey.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmQ0NWQxYTQ5YTQyZTBhZGVjYzkwODBkMGIyN2Ux"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMDUzN2QzY2NhZTRhNWVhZDQ4ZTYwMmIzYWFjODYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I was. But I needed them to think this was all according to whatever plan they had.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzhmMDRlZjU5YTRmNDFhY2FjZGViNGQwNzZlMGIw"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NmQxZDEyNDQxYzQ2MTg4ZmM5MmY5YzQ3MWIzMDU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Warning! Contact! Contact!” Sensor Crabbit called out and I grimaced as out the side of the viewport I could see flashes. And then lights flew around the Phantom. All misses fortunately.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWFkYzllMGZiNTQyZTE5MGRkOWI1NTUzNzA3ZTRh"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YzI1NDg2M2FiODQxNzM5YjcwM2Q1YTVlNmFjZTc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright everyone! You know what to do!” I called out and the Crabbit cheered despite the seriousness of what was happening.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjBhNDI3NWViYTRiODVhNzU2Mzc2YWIyYmM1YzFi"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNmIzYTE0NjBjYzRiNDU5NGIxYzdhYjA4ZTZmZmM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess it was to their own benefit that they didn’t have any understanding of death.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjAyY2ZlNjU3OTRlOWJhZjg3Y2NjYTkwZDM0MjI3"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NjlmMGQ1NjNhNzQwNTI5ZTYwMDRmMGZmMzQ5ZTAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later I felt the hum of power flowing through the ship and the turret started firing. Lasers shooting off into the distance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzViNjE2ZTk2MzRkMjA4OWY4YTYxNjRmMmVjMDMx"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMjBhNDM5ZDBmNTRkNGY4ODA1M2UzM2MzNDBhNTJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Miss! Miss! Bad Math!” The Tactical officer called out and I ignored her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTU3MTRhNWYxYTRmMTZhYmQyYmIwZjUxZTk4MWRi"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZTFlZWZiM2RhOTQ4NDQ4MTU3NGIwOTE1NTJhYzE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">That started the long distance portion of this fight. The Pirates came at me as fast as their ships could push, and I was forced to try and run, just too slow to use proper maneuvers against them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDQ5ODZjNWY1ZjRkOTlhNzYzMmU0ZjBjZDQ1ZTE0"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZDhiZGQ3YWNhOTQ0ZGU4YjdkZDhjZmZkNTRjYTky"><span style="font-weight: 400">If only I had the rest of the nacelles this would be a different battle.The Phantom was kind of a big girl for just two engines. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjg3OGQzZGFhYzRlMTg4NWQxZGNhOWNkYjkxZjMz"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NzMwM2ExOTRmNzQ3YzA5NDA5MGIyZDA1Y2VkMDhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re in range of the first missile platform!” Navigation Crabbit called out and I nodded pleased. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">That was a relief. At least one surprise was now set.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODg1Mzk0YjNhMTRmODE4MzA5NWEyZWI2MGMwNmY0"> </p>
<p class="cnM2N2RlNzA3MmI1NTRhZGZhOWQyZWE1OWY2MDczZmYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Awww. Almost hit. Almoooost!” I smiled as despite the ‘Bad Math’ the Tactical Officer was enjoying the shooting gallery.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTJkMDExNGNjMzQ2MDNiZjIxNmVhOGMxNTNhNjhj"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MDZjMzNjMWI4NzQ5Mzk4NTk5ZjUzNTc4MWQzMzU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Warning. Pirates are shifting into Aft position!” Sensor Crabbit called out, and I nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjAzNTQyMzhjMzQzZTA4NjFjYjZhNTE2ZDdhZjA4"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, beginning adjustment.” I called out mostly for the tactical Crabbit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjhiMzhiMDM2ZjRhZDNhODJiOTYwOTdmMjA2ZGU3"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMmY3ZTI3YjBmNjRiMzk5NDFlMDM4YTljZGJhMDlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I shifted the controls, and the ship began sort of sliding. The back nacelles had a bit of wiggle to them, and it meant we could move almost, but not quite sideways. It was enough to get the big front gun to shoot back towards anything that was chasing me as long as I could keep them entirely from behind me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWUzYzM0NmYxYTQ0NGNhOTkzOTgyZjkyZDA3Yjg4"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYzAwMTJiOWI2OTQ0N2FhYTlhODg2NTNlZmU1Mjc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">A tone went through the bridge and I grimaced.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTk3NzU4Nzk4MjQxMTFiOWMxNzhmNTA5ZjhmOWUz"> </p>
<p class="cnNjODBmMzIwNThiZjRjMzE4ZWIzOWEzNWJkMWQ4ZTlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enemy… Hit? Bad Math!? How!?” My tactical officer squeaked out in outrage that the pirates had gotten a strike on the shields.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzlkMGI1YzYxMzRkOWI4ZmMwMDRjMWMwMzEyMWQ4"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZGViM2UxYzIyNzQ4ZTk5OWFkOTgwYzc4NzU3YTQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I ignored her little rant as I looked at the data. Shield emitters had held of course, but they were heating up.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjc3MDFjMzhmNjQ1NGFhMTgyOGY5ZTIyYWU1OTNm"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MDJkMTE3YWZhMzQ2MTQ4YzYzODIwYjczODE2ZDc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dispersal was ongoing already, but these emitters were cheap, they weren’t designed for war. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDA3MjFlMzA0ZTQ5YTJhYWIyODNjZWIyODE4YTll"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZDY4MDQ4YzMzZDQxNjRiODZkYjU4M2JlOTcxNmZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The enemy were catching up. I wasn’t going to be able to make it to the next missile satellite screen before I was overrun.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODE4Zjc0ODdiMzQ3MjRhYmFjMjdhYzg5ZDQxOTFl"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNDJlNjNlMTA5NjQ5MWRiMWJiNmM0NTdkY2FjYTgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Deep breath. In and out.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjM2NWYxNTNkODQ4ZmU5NDAzMzllNzYwZmNjMjcy"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NTcwMmFjNmNlNzQyZjVhMTk1OGVkNTI0NWM2NmRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">What to do? You’re the Captain Kat. The choice of what to do is yours. Do you try to run, use the missile satellites to hopefully scare them off? Turn and fight? Or…</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDE3ODA2Yjc5ZDQ1YmM4M2FlMjQ5YTU4N2FjMDYw"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Or do you jump into the warp and get the hell out of here. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWEyMGJjZmM0MzRhM2RiMDkxNzJjMjk1MmE4ODdi"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZjgyY2RmYmI5MjQ5ZjM5YTRiZGM3OGVmM2Q5ZjZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">They’d blame me, but… But I would survive. The pirates would likely destroy the Octavious, maybe even steal the ship, or they’d just start grabbing things from the scrap yard.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTg0YTg0ZjNhMzRiZGU4NDhmNDk0NjcxZGY4OTk1"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZTg4MzQzZTAzNzRjZmNhMGE5N2FjN2Q2YjAwODgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">UNK-L would likely be safe. Trying to take an entire station would be crazy. It’s not like they could escape with it. That doesn’t mean all the people on board would be safe though.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWUxN2JjMmYxMDQ5ODA4YzhhODg3NjM4NzZjYTgx"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMjYyMzhiMzYyZjRiMjc5NThlOTEyMDJjYWUzZThh"><span style="font-weight: 400">But…</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjM4Y2E4YzA4ZTRiNjFhODM3OTIwNGZhZTU5ZmRi"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZGU3ZjU4Yzg0YzRkYWI5YzhmM2EwZGY1ZjE5MDJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was that who I wanted to be? Or was I the kind of captain that was brave and eeked out victory from impossible odds?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWIyMDQ2YWNmYTQzZTA4Y2I0YzAyYzA4MjgzYTQw"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YWNlZWYwMTkwNTRiN2M4NmRjYWI3YTNkNjMyZDgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Could I?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzJlOGI3YzlkMTRmM2RiZWQ5Nzg2ZWM0MmJlNGI1"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNDgzY2Q5MjA0YzQ0YWU5ZTVkMDZkY2JmODI5NjFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran down the list of what was currently installed. Not much. Not much at all. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODE2OGNhOWE0NjQ2NjM4MTlmYzk1ZjNhYzljYjZl"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZmFiYmQ3OWRmNzQyZDg5ODhiMzAwMDJiMTdjOWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I really wish I had missiles, or something, that would be enough. There was just one thing that might work.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWI0NmExZWU0ODQyZGM5MjVlODFmMmVkMTllMmQ3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNjBmYmEwNzVmMDRlNjY5ZmRjMzY5NWNhMWU1MTI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Might.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDMyM2I0YzhkNDRkOWY5ZGQyOTRiNDRmNzIyZTZh"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMDMzYmQwOGNlMTRmNjc4OGIzYjRiZGJjYzY4NzZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Or it could blow up my entire ship and I’d be lost forever. I didn’t exactly want to reveal it either…</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWFiYmU4ZDliODQwOWZiZjc4YWJhNmFhYzhhOTY4"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYWIzZjg5MDU4NTQyZTZiNDBhOTg4YzY0Nzk3YjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn’t even tested the damn thing! All the work on coding I had put into it… I still wasn’t sure if it was ready or if it would fail and kill me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzg5NmU2OGIwMDQ4ZDFiZDc4MGNjMzlmNzQzMTlj"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNzFjNmMwZGIyMTQzOWI5ZjFhMzFkMzMyM2Q2MTVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ship could go into subspace, drop into warp and move. But Subspace Depth Adjustment was something else entirely.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzcxZDRjZTk0YjRjMWFiYjFhNTM1MzkwMjgzOWFh"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOTg5ZTEwZjBmMjQ1ODQ5MzdiNGQ3ZmM3OWUxMDU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">SDA was insane tech, something that no one out here on the frontier should have the tech for. I had made it just in case this sort of situation happened, but I had wanted to actually try going into warp a few times before I ever tried it. I had no data for the Diamond Drive, and how it interacted with subspace. I’d be jumping blind.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjY0MjY0MGJiNjRmNTI5ZTczNjAxYzE4NDE4M2U3"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OWMwMTUzNDg4YTQ3YzJiYTUyNWM5NjNlNzMzMTlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Another tone went off. A second rear shield hit.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGJjODAzMzljZDQ1ZjZhYzU2YzcyYzI3ZThhMGRj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZWYyYTc4ODYyODQ5Zjg5ZTBhNjM2MGM1MjlkNDAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t win this from range. There were just too many ships and too many vectors to win a long range fight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWVhMzg0ODlhYjRiZmQ5MjI2YmNlM2FiNjYwOTRh"> </p>
<p class="cnMwN2VhNzAwODRkYjQ0NDk4Yzg1Yzk3NTk2N2I4MjZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t win this close up. The Pirates would tear the Phantom Star apart.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjNhMTVmMTZjZDRjYmU4YmNjNTY0YWY5MzIzNmIz"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYTE3MTE2YTRlODQ4M2ViMjQ3MjNhNjZmZGRlYjY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t win this from escaping, that wasn’t a win. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmE1M2RmZDE5NTQzMzc5Y2QzZGNiOTA4ZmIyYTVj"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NjM5OTc0YTRlNjQ0ZmM5MzkzY2Q4YWZhYTMyMjUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m turning us around. Get me some hits!” I called out and Tactical cheered. She would have more range if the gun was facing forward. “We’re going to dive into Warp. Navigation… activate the SDA controller!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWY2NmUwODllMjQ5YmJiOGViZTVjNjYyZmQyNDcy"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger!” It called out cheerfully.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDU0MDNiNzg5NjQ2N2I5Zjg5ZTIxOWM2ZDA0YzJm"> </p>
<p class="cnNiOWVkNjBiYzQ5MzQ3N2E4NTI5ZWU4NGRiYThlYjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course it was. It had no idea what dangers we were in. My cute little Crabbit enjoyed their life with the fearlessness of a child. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2FhMjc1ODIyODQ5MmY5ZjE2M2FmNzg1YWI5MTBj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5Mzg2Nzc2YmZkMTRkY2E5NTU3MDhlZGIwMTZiYzg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at my hands, at how badly they were shaking. I had built the controller out of spare warp controllers. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTBhZTEyOWE4NjQxY2Q5MjA5YTJhZDAxZjE0Njk4"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYzhiNWExYThiNjQ1OTU4ODMxZjFmMzMxZmNmYzU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had built it out of scrap. Out of warp controllers that had once controlled civilian vessels, and now I was going to rely on that to do one of the most dangerous maneuvers I could imagine. This was pure stupidity. But… My code was good. My work was accurate, and the Song had guided me.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkMzRjZjMxOTI3YTRmNWJiNWNlODRmYTA5YzI5MThi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Be clear. Be sure.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwMWJhMDFlY2MxNDQwZWFiNmRkMjBlYjIwNWJkNDdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my hands on the controls, taking over from navigation, and spun the ship around.</span></p><span class="cjliNmVmYjczYjUxMjQ2ZTY5NGFlMGI4NTY4NWMxZTEz"><br/>Ensure your favorite authors get the support they deserve.

Tell everyone that isn’t currently busy to do the same. Everyone should be joining navigation.

I watched as the bubble that kept realspace in, and subspace out shifted. The front of it sharpened, instead of a flat curve, it gained a crease and a sharp edge. </span></p>

<p class="cnNhMzkxYTFiMDY4ZTQzYmU5ZDYwNTU5MmQ2ODg5ZmJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my mouth open and close but no sound came out. The vibration was so bad I couldn’t even speak, as the air itself was stealing the vibration from my throat.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3ZmUyYWZjZjkxOTRhM2Y5Y2MxOWEyODMzZjYxZDU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">So. That was it. The Phantom Star disappeared in the flash of a warp disruption.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWNmNGJkOTg0MzQ0NjJiOWQ1MDFlNDY4MDFmNzgw"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZmNiNzRiODJlYTRjNmI5ZmU5MTMxNGNjZTk0ZTVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The girl fled.” Hamlin grumbled, an interesting tone to his voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjVhODhiMDU2ZjRiZjA5NWE3NjA3Y2EzOWNjYWMy"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYzRjYzBiZTMzYjQ1YjJhMjcyNmRiNDdhODYwYjE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t sound so disappointed. She’s a scrap brat.” Artemis replied without a hint of emotion despite her words. “You can’t expect everything from her.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s got a soldier's blood. I just expected better.” He replied back. Cyger side eyed the navy man. His broad shoulders, and structured face hinted at his own origins. Soldier Nanomachines, of a more advanced variety than the girl, ran through the man's blood. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWIyNGM4ZGVmODRmYjQ5ZGUxNjVlYzllZmIxODY3"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YjcyMTM4MDZjNzRhMjQ5YTUxZmI5ZjE0ZGZmMTU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">A bond that sometimes came out with those who had been biologically modified. Well in the lower castes anyways.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NmE2YTE0OGFkZDQxZDlhNDM5ZDgxOWRiYmU5MzAx"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMzZjZTUwMTI2YjQ3Yjk5YTllNTFiM2E2M2MyNjk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nobles rarely felt the distant bonds to each other in that way.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGNmNWIyYWMyMDQwMjM4MjlhZjZlZjhkM2M1ODE3"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYzM2YjM5YTFjNTRiMDk5ODI0ZmE2NTVkMzhiMzM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She did what she could without risking her life.” Cyger replied to the two. “We can not expect her to do our duty. Battlestations! The Pirates will come for us now.” He demanded and his men saluted and got to work.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzQyNTA3YTBiMzQ1NDliNTlkNjExOWMxZTg0N2Mz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYzAzMmE4M2QxNTRkZmE5NjY3NzQ2NjdhNGUwNWZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a death sentence possibly for all of them. Cyger rose. He would not flee just yet, but he would. They knew that, and so did he, but as long as he stayed here, discipline will remain and it’ll give the ship slightly better odds.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjZkYjNlMmMwZTRkOGM5MGRjYzI2ODk3YzRlYzNl"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YzA3YzNjZWIxZjQzMjc5NzVkYjMyYjJjYWVlYTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">If they could get enough hits at long range, they might be able to survive until the pirates got close enough for all the weapons to wipe them from space.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzUwOGQ1MGYzYTQ1ZmNhNjAyYjllZDMwYjBjZmZi"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MjEyNTk1NmJjODRjMjg4MGNmMjc5M2MwNmI5NmRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlikely. Pirates weren’t fools. They’d come at an angle that made firing at them difficult, and the Octavius would be unable to adjust.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmMzODk5YjY0MzQ4NGNhOGE5NTIyNjJhNGJiZGFj"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYTcwNWMyMzQ2ZTQxNzlhNzUzMGVlZjIwMzRkNmY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyger stepped away from his seat, moving around the bridge.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWM2NmNjMjI2YjQwNTQ4NDA1MGViMmNjYzAxNDBl"> </p>
<p class="cnM2OTMxNzdmY2RlZTQ4YTlhZTk2NTRiOWZhNDA0MzYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">This ship had been given to him as a boy. He had spent more time on this ship than at his family's holdings. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTI5NTAzODc4ZDQwZDA5MmY0YzVhMzA0ZjY3MjNl"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MjI2MzJmODQ5MzQ4MzFiYzFjNDg4ZDI2M2U3ODE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was in every respect his home.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmYzBkZWJjZDVlODQ3YTlhYmMzMzcwNThmYTViMDli"><span style="font-weight: 400">So he took a moment to memorize it once more. He walked over to the old dedication plaque on the wall. The bronze was kept polished, a sign of his crew's respect for the ship.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">KRW Octavius. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjFhYjNhYTA0YjQzMzRiNWU2NWY0NTk5MDhhNTE2"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNDg2ZWYzNzA3MDQ3NDQ4NzU2NzhmMjlmMmVlZDc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kenish-Ritz Warship Octavius. His ship. His home. The symbol of his nobility. He’d have to transfer to one of his support vessels after this, and he would go from an up and coming nobility to just a foolish boy of the Ritz family. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjg4MWJhMjAzMDRiZjc4YTQzMTNiYjI3MmViNGU4"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZmQ4MGFhNTk3NTRkZGY5ODZkOTE3ZGVlZjM4OWY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">He’d never get another Frigate to command, this was the end of his upward ascension.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmUyYmNhYzQwYzQ1NWFhMGQ2MDUyMjBjNjgyYzc5"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMTIzYzIwYmIyODRmZWE5ZjA5ZGIyYTZkYzIyODYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Baron?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing Artemis.” He replied to the woman, his operations officer, who was far more than that. “The shuttle?” He asked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is ready sir.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very good then.” But he didn’t move. Instead, consider his words. The men on board the Octavius deserved some last words from him. Most would likely die while the Pirates swept the Octavius aside, and more would die after as they went looting. Plenty of good materials in a Frigate of this size.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzA3ZjA2Mzg5NjQ4ZTE5ZGVmOGEzZWQ0YjUzNTkw"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMjcyZDhiN2VhMzRiMDNhNjI5MWU0YzNiODUxZTUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Warp Entrance? No… Something else?” A voice called out, alerting the bridge and Cyger turned, focused. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjM2NjIzMDI4MTQ0MGJiZmJlYjhlMmFmNzE4NzEz"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MTkwYjI1OTZjNDQ3MGE4MjczYzkzOTIzYmU4NTg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hope? Was it a traveling warship hearing the distress signal?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjMzNWFlN2UxODQzMjJiZDBkYTYxNWY3NDNiYWNh"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YTE2N2E2MjYxOTRkOGZhNTExZTU4YTNhNGFhODli"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean something else? Speak up!” Hamlin roared and the bridge officer just shook his head. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWY3ODlhNjIwNTQzMzQ4OWVmODNkNzJhN2JkN2U1"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know sir! A Warp Emergence, but it’s not completing!” Before a word could be said the ship’s alert sounded lightly. Warning the shields had been struck.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDg4YWNlZmRkYzQ1YWQ4NzM1MDljYzNjZDhjYzRh"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hamlin stopped his forward momentum to check, an old habit, he had to see if the hit had done any damage. When no damage report came he continued on. He marched over to the sensor operator and loomed over him as he glared at the boy's screen.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzU5OGJmMTUxYTRjZDhhMTU5NTQwM2E1ZTkzMzBl"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OWQ3ZGFlMjk4ZjQ1OTU5NzBmN2ExNDFjYjU4YTFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know sir! Look! It’s a Warp Emergence signature but the rift isn’t forming!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTdmZDdjMTM1MzQ1NDBhNmQyNDA3Zjc0OTJiZWUw"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMmI1ODc4NmE1MzRlOTBiODZjNmU2ZWI5NjFhYjRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me a broad subspace scan.” Cyger demanded as he walked back to his own chair. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDlhMDk1ODhmYzQ0ZTRhYzQyOTA0ODFiNTI3MmI1"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNjQxYjlmZmFiNzQ5MDk5MzM1NDMyZTY0MDI0ZTU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">They still had time and something odd could only be an advantage now.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDQzNjIzOThkODQ0ZTRiYTVkNmRlZDc4NjM0Mjk3"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZWZhMjI5YWZjYzRhZGVhNzQ4NjNmMTg1ZDhmMTNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s… Sir! The Phantom Star?” The operator called and Cyger felt himself confused. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjRkYzc0NTAzNDQ2ODJiMDQ3YjNjMjRmMjZkMzA4"> </p>
<p class="cnMzM2YwMTNhNDAyNDQwZTJiZWUzYTcxZGNiNTEzY2Ux"><span style="font-weight: 400">Did the girl find her bravery and return to fight again? Why? It was too late for that. Even if she emerged, she’d be a sitting asteroid for the pirates fire, emergence rifts were excellent for improving even the most scoundrel of pilots accuracy. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzBjNGRkNTQ4MjQ0OGQ5MWM5OGYxOWFmMDkxZTAy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MTU1YTQ3NzYyMjQyNWM5ZWQ2YWQyZmJiNGQxYzdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then as Cyger looked out into space watching the five plasma trails grow closer and closer, suddenly out from nowhere shot a bright beam of energy, one he was familiar with.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWExMGZjZDgxNDRkNGM5NDk0MGZkODBhM2Y2MzZl"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMThlNGEwMzQ1OTRjY2E5YmVhZTZlYmM0NjNlN2Iz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enemy ship destroyed!?” The sensor operator called out and Cyger could feel the bridge crew perk up.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGNmOGZkMDg0NDQ1N2RhYWNkOGZjNWYzZGFiM2Fk"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNTE1Y2Q0MGJjNDQ0NjNiZDMxZjBiNWMwNDkwN2Zi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Was that a Thermal Lance?” He asked, and Hamlin spoke immediately. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was.” But the man was staring at the same sensor terminal still trying to make heads or tails of what he was seeing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjhiYmNlZmNkZjQyYTI4NzEzNTRkNWJjMzY5MjFi"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YWVhYzdkZDUwZDRhZGE5MjEwZDc5ODkxMTRhNDAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hamlin?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know Sir. some kind of sensor spoofing? According to our scans, The Phantom Star is in subspace.” Cyger nodded, evidently that was false as the girl had attacked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGU5ZGI5ZWEzNDQ3M2FiNzAxOWI1MDBkZDE2ODBh"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZDNlNWVkMDZhZTRhNjViZTEwYmYxZjVlZDJmMDli"><span style="font-weight: 400">“SDA.” The voice came not from Hamlin, but from Artemis, the woman spoke it calmly with surety.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjQxNmY5NDJkMjRmMTI4NzdhOTE3ODNmMGUwOTM5"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMDk3OWQ2MDJiNzRjMWQ5OTIzNmQwM2ExM2ZjNzUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impossible.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“And yet, it is what is happening.” She said as another burst of Plasma appeared from seemingly nowhere, and another of the pirate freighters popped.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWFmNzYyNTE5MjQyNzNiODI4OGEzMDVhY2Q0Yzc0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNjA2YjJmNWRmZTQ0NTJiMjNmZGVlNzYzMjJmZmM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly the enemy force looming on them was scattering terrified and unable to fight back at some invisible unassailable foe.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmQ0ZTVmNzRlZjRkOTI5NjRmNTI5YTMyNWExMjc3"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MTVhNDVmNzUzNTRmZjE5MzcwMDdjYzFmYjk1MmZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then a burst of light as Subspace split open, and out came the Phantom Star almost spinning as it re-emerged from Subspace.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzhiOTA2MjA3NTRhODI4M2EzYzkzZGRlNDllZDhk"> </p>
<p class="cnNmM2FiMzIwMzNlMjRkOWVhNWJjNTUzNjk0MGJjNmY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmJhZGUyNjQ0MDRmM2JiYjBiM2NmNzNhNTc1NTNl"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYjQ4YzgwODFkNjQ1OWI5ZWE0NGJhNTA3MTE1NzZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Subspace Depth Adjustment it was. Impossible. Improbable, something he just saw with his own two eyes and yet… Something he couldn’t believe. Not even the greatest minds of the Kenish Duchy had figured out that upgrade to the Warp Controllers.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTU2MTBkMjY5NDQ5MTY4MTY2NmIzNDFiYjU5MGVl"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMTJhYTY5NzAyYjQ5OTk5M2JiNjI0MzA0MTkzZDc3"><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yet, she had managed this, an impossible act? What sort of genius had he stumbled upon?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjdkMzAwYjIwNjQxMDlhYTQyNDUyOTU4ZTgzZjY3"> </p>
<p class="cnM0M2NmOWFlYTExOTRiM2ZhOTgxY2FhMWQ0ZTEzNjFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was surprising, and there was impossible. Katherine Ferrous just firmly put herself into that new category.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTdkMzgwNGZiYjQxMmViNzk2NDA4NmE5ZWNiNmQ4"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NjAwYzNlYzZkMjRlZTViMTA1MTA3YmM0NTE1ZTc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">How fascinating.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNmMmE5NzlkM2MxYjRhODBiMDA0Y2RiNDU2YzliYzUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly, as the drip drip of liquid splattering onto steel slowed to a stop I finally started feeling at least a little better. My nose had stopped bleeding, at least, which was a good sign. My eye fluttered as I tried to open them, and I realized one of them was crusted over.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODFkMzNjOTY0ODQxMWJiM2RjNTk4MmIxYThmZTg1"> </p>
<p class="cnNlY2VlYjc4ODQ5NDRmZmViYTA3MDk2ODI3YmFlZTdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt strong enough to stand up with only a little wobble to retake my seat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDYyNTAyNDQxMzQ1Njg5ZWFmYTE4YjgwZGUwMzhl"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYzY3ODQzMWNmYzQzN2Q5ZTNlZjdiNTk0NDNhYzVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Status report? And let’s get back to UNK-L. I think we need to dock.” I called out weakly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes yes! Damage bad! Ouchies!” I nodded at the report and just rested for a while as I felt the ship move. The Crabbit were more than capable of putting the ship onto an autopilot route, and I dozed a bit until I felt the tremble go through the hull as we docked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWYzYzBlNzBhZDQ2ODdhNDVkMWY0NjRmNzA0YTZm"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMWM2ZWY0NWUzYjQyZTZiNWNlZjVmMTZlNTA3N2M4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I blinked my crusted eyes and rose up with a groan. It wasn’t a sharp pain, but I felt bruised and achy as I stumbled a bit through the ship to the docking port. With a fumbled press against the lock it opened and I smiled a bit as Dad was there.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODI1MzMwZjkyMTQxMjk4MTJhMzdlZmExOTllM2Yw"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MjBmZjUwYzBlODQ2ZmY4MjJmMTJlOTA4N2I2OTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kat! He called out instantly in shock as he rushed in and grabbed me up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">It was nice not to have to hold myself upright, and soon I was pulled out of the ship and placed on a nearby bench as I was fussed over.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTkwYmZlNWMzYTRjN2U4NTE3MTkwYjNhNjYxOTQy"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YzY3M2RlODNmNDRkYzhhZDcwZWJmYmVkODI0Yjk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Station Doctor was called, and I didn’t complain like I normally would. I definitely needed to be checked out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDMyMTU2YmY1YTRmY2I5ZWVjNjc3M2QxNjNlODhj"> </p>
<p class="cnM0Y2M4MjZlNjJiMDQ2NTY4YmNlNTczM2ViYTFjODIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Move aside you lumps.” Mom’s voice called out and the horde of people around me spread with only Dad staying close kneeling in front of me as his rough hand held my own, gentle stroking with his thumb, it was actually pretty comforting.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWU0ZDcxZDQzNjQ0OThhNGM5MzEwMjlmOTM2NWQ2"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZTQwMDliNDI0YjRiMzI4NzdhZDAwMzY0YmIxMWEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Mom sat beside me, a cool hand tilted my head towards her as she looked me over. “Poor thing.” She whispered to me, and I smiled a little weakly. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGYzYWM2NTg5YTRlNjhhOGVmNzEzNDRhOGFmZWVk"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You should see the other guy.” I joked, but then slumped a bit because once again people were dead. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmY1ZjQ2OGM0OTQ4Y2Y4NmZjOGI1MjAwMGM3NDIx"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OTcxNmY2OGYwNzRiZWM4ODViOTNkNjQxYmE5NjRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of people probably, and I was directly responsible once more. I felt myself sort of drift for a while before suddenly I was brought back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmI0NTYzMDZjOTQ2MWY4ZGY3NGJkZTA4YTY2NTM3"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MTJmOTA5M2RlODRmZjg5MzE2Mzg1OTg0YjI4MmNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Warmth was brought up to my cheek. A wet rag ran over my sensitive skin. I blinked my eyes open realizing I had closed them, to see Mom there, wiping at my face gently. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDFiYmRmY2ExMzQzMzk5ZjAwMWNiODNiNzNjY2Uz"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OWY1YzI4NmI0ZTQ0NTU4NjQzODFmN2ZjOGU3ZjVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s get you cleaned up.” She offered and I nodded as she cleaned up the blood and puke that had coated part of me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjQyNTVmYjVkYjRkYWJiZTgyYTcxNTI3YzAwMjE3"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MmY5MjRkMGE0MzRlMTk5N2ZjYWQ4NzViODVjMTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">God I really must have looked like a mess.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGUzNTZiMDM3YzQxMDFhN2RmNTQyZTM0NmU3YmNj"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDQyYjcyZTM4YjQxNzA5NTg4YWE1MDRjM2E4ZDM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, there’s my patient.” A new voice called out, and I looked up to see Aunt Bea. The woman was a doctor of sorts for the station and was already pulling out some tools from her belt. A moment later a scanner ran over me, and I made sure to pay attention to her face, blinking weakly to remain focused despite everything as she did so.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2E0MmE2ZmZmMDQ5MGZiMTAwNzk3NWZhMmMwNzZl"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMWRlYjQ1MDNiNjRjZmRiY2QzYmEwOGVhMWI4NWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Aunt Bea would always give away the prognosis with her face. Woman had absolutely no poker face at all.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTg0OTZiMzk3MDRkMWY5YjZjZDAzMGEwODY4YzQz"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZGE0MzNjMzZhYTRlNzc4Yjg4ZWRjYTNjNmI2OTQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully her face turned into a smile. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDlhNzhiMmFjZTRjYmU5YzI1YjU3ZDNmZDgzZjcx"> </p>
<p class="cnNjM2Y5ODhlZmIwNDQ4Yjg4MjhjOGIzZGNiNTU0MmJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re bruised up, but the dizziness will pass, and the bloody nose is okay too. You got quite a bit of vibrational stress there. Whatever you did, don't do it again, okay Kat?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.” I agreed instantly, because that sucked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODUxODJmOGNmMTQyNWY4NDFmNTg3ZWFhOWI1MTEw"> </p>

<p class="cnMzODUxN2E5YWYwZDRiZjJhZWZjNWI0YjVkYWUzMzM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking up to the airlock of the Octavius I wilted a little under the looks of the two guards standing outside it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzU4ZWVmNjA3MzQzMWJiNjM2NjRiOWU2OTE5MDFm"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNGY5ZmFhNTI2ODQ2NjZiNTUyNDBmNGJlMTllOGU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The soldiers were huge and both locked eyes onto me the moment I started approaching.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjYzZjJjMTY0YjRiYWU5ZDE4YzE2N2M5ZWM1Mjg5"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NzhiOGJhMGExNzQxODJhNTczM2ViNjkzYjE2NjA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm. The Baron?” I managed to stutter out before the guards nodded and stepped aside. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDVhZDVjYTlmZDRjN2Q4YTM1MDJmZmQ3NjA1Njkz"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYmY5MzAwM2M1MzQ5ZWNiNDE2OWUyNzJlODc4Mzkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll escort you Captain.” The guard offered surprisingly kindly and I perked up a little. They might be scary as fuck in their uniforms with some minor armor plating, and laser rifles, but they were nice I guess?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTE3NTZkMDIxNDQyOGI4M2ZjMWNjNzMzYWQyODc2"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZjEwNjlkODkzNTQ1ZmFiZjhkNThkODU0YjJlYmEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed along into the well lit clean halls of the Octavius. I once again looked around in slight jealousy at the Phantoms' less than clean interior. I’d get there eventually, but for now it was a mess.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjE1MTMzZjY1YTRiZmY5NzQ3ZGU3YTRlOWI4OGVm"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NmUyMjliODM2NTRjNGFhYzBhYjc3NDBiNDQ2ZDhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Following after I continued wringing my hands as we traveled deeper into the ship. I didn’t know what the Baron was really after with this, but it made me super uncomfortable. I just wanted to fix the Phantom Star. Not… Carouse with nobility!</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTdlNjNiM2QwMjQyMmI4ODM3MjViZjM1NTE4NTJh"> </p>
<p class="cnNkODc5ZDUyODRjZTRlNDdiZGQ0ZTcxNWI1NGFjMTU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was common sense not to piss off nobles. I had some protection from it being from a middle class background, but even Uncle Kyle would be really wary about pissing off someone of the nobility.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmZlYWZiOWQ2OTQzZTQ5NGQ3Nzg3OTA5OTMyMDNk"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZjRmZDI4Yzg2YTQ4MGU4YWZiMzU3M2JmZTQ1ZWJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Out here in the Kenish Duchy, on the frontiers of explored space, they were the law, and they had the weapons to back it up.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWY3ZmNlN2U0MTQ4ZWU4ZTc0NWE1NzBlZDk3MTVj"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYzNjMDVmMGU0YzQ3OWZhYmI0YTcxMDYzMzUwYTA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Another reason to get my ship up and running. Kind of hard to press me into something when I had weapons to argue my point.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzYzZjBhNWY3YzQyMGFhMDE0NDJhNWJjOTljYzYy"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZWYxODU0MTc2YTQzYzA5NzFiOWMzYjBlZDA0NGYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the soldier stopped and a door opened. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjg0ZDlmZTAyMjQyNzc5NDMwZjRjNjM2OWY4ZmEw"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MTI3MjZjNzY3NzQzNGU5MzM0ZmIwODFmOWM2ZjQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">There stood the same woman that had invited me to this dinner. Artemis? Cool name, scary woman.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzBjYTRjYmY0MTRlNjhhZjY5NzM4MjRmMjJiNDZl"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYjQ3NDc3ZTdjZjRiOWI4NzM0ZTJiODJlNTExYzI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent. You’re dismissed. Captain Katherine, please follow me.” She spoke, the guard I had been following saluted and then I was following her inside into a room that was… Swanky? </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTY1MTg3Y2I2OTQxNjI4N2Y3MzMxZGZjMTg5NWI0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MDA5YzU3MzA3MDRmZDlhZWE1YTBjM2M1ZTNlMzY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Large window panes with a view out to space, with lots of gilding and pomp. It was like something out of a period drama, only with a space backdrop.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDRlYTJjMzYyNDQ5ZDU5MWY2MzIxNzFkMzczMjgy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiOWI3MWJlMTQyOTRlNGM5MzdlOWJhZTc5NDlkYWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The large table in the center of the room was just large enough for a group of people to sit around it, without it being so large you couldn’t talk to people. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGI2YzY1NjBkYzRkNTY5YzJhNGQyMThjOWZhNDQy"> </p>
<p class="cnM1Njk4ZjM4YTdhMTRjZTc5OWNlODdhMjIxMGY0ZTlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">And around it was a collection of familiar faces. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGNjZDFkODkyNzRkOGVhYmI5NTkzOTdmMDA5NTFj"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZGViYmFmNDE1NTRmZjNiZjUzNjlhM2FkNTlhZjY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to wring my hands a bit as I realized that my idea of casual, and their idea of casual might not be the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTRmODJjYzFiNzRiMzZiZDA3MzY4NDVkYzEwZjU0"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YzVjOWZlN2I1MDQzY2JiZWM1YjRkZGJmZDg2MmIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure I was wearing clean clothes, but my jumpsuit, and work shirt were still rough, and a bit stained. I lowered my hands a bit to try and hide the old grease stain in my shirt just under my chest. Maybe no one would notice?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWExMDAxNGZmNjRmMjA4MTc4ZDQ3M2RjYzFkODE4"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZDQzNWEzMDg2MTQ5N2FhNDU1MmFhM2E0MzY2MmU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">No. They would notice. I sighed quietly as I was guided forward.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDkyZmJiYmM3YzQxODk5NWQxMTYxOTEyNjY4MzAz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOTA5YjM2NmJlZTQ1ZWE5MWQxZTFmZDEyODU1ZWI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Katherine Ferrous.” Artemis introduced me, and the Baron rose from his seat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWVkOWE4NWMxOTRiNmU5NzQwNzFmOWUyY2ViMDgz"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NjQ1YTQ1MmIwZjQzM2I4OGM5Njk3ZmM4NzM1YWJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wonderful! The woman of the hour. Please Captain take a seat here, be welcome as an honored guest at my table.” He said, speaking formally… Which, I wasn’t sure if it was just his personality, or some tradition I had no idea about.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzZhMjBjYWQ4MDRjYTRhYzgzOTg0YWJlMWMwZDQ2"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YjhiMGNlNTQ3NDQwZTY5YmUzZDQ4NGMwYTZkZmZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Greeeeat.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked to the seat at the Barons right hand that was held open for me and I settled in, only once I did, did I notice the rest of the men around the table also taking their seats.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjEzMWI2ZTNjYzRjODc5Y2NkZjJhYzQ0NDk0OGFm"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NDgzMDAzMzM1OTRhYzk5Y2IwMGQ4NjAzYzI5ZDhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">As I had moved, Artemis I noticed had also taken her seat at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmM1MTUzM2E1NjQ2MWM5MTFmZjBmZGY4ZjU5ZjJh"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NmIzYThmMTMyYjQxMjc5ODQ0MmQwY2IwMDdjNGE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took just a moment as I sat to notice the height difference of everyone at the table. The chair was just large enough for me, but it still left me head above the Baron on my left. It made it really hard to sink into the chair to hide.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWQ3NmIwODY5MTRhNGE4NWExY2NlNzUwOTc4MzBm"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNzFiMzcxNzYwNDQ5OGU5NzBjNTcwMzZhZjFlODZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for coming, I hope my spread will delight you. I pulled out all the stops in celebration of our victory.” The Baron began and I smiled a bit weakly as I looked at all the food on the table.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOThlMzFmMDgzMTQ2MzE5MzkyMzg5YzhjNTBmZjE2"> </p>
<p class="cnNlN2M3YzMzMzgzMzRmMjc4ZWJjM2Y4MTNiMTkyNWM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had once lived on earth with its seemingly infinite amount of food from all over the globe, but I couldn’t name a single dish that was heaping on the table in front of me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDRiZDljNzQ2YTQ4MDNiODcyZTU1NzMwNTJiNDFj"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZmVkMjJiMWVhMDQ4MjBhNjE2MDA5NmU1ZTRkNjcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched with an awkward eye as everyone began. A pointed finger, and the plate would float up from the table and move into reach. Everyone began filling their plate, so I pulled up my bravery and pointed at something that didn’t look like it was going to make me sick.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGIzMTE5OWU5MzQ0YmE5Y2FjMTg1YTMyMmQzNjIx"> </p>
<p class="cnMwOGNjMDFkZjA2YTRiNTg4YjA1NTYyZDFlYTcyZjY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">When it floated over I used the tongs to grab a bunch of what I had thought was noodles.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTM5NjkzNWEyNzQ2MmNiMWQxYzcwNGQzY2U1NzQy"> </p>
<p class="cnM4Mjc5YTljMmZhMzRkYWU4YzhlODViZmE3MjM5Zjky"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nope. Not noodles…</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2E5NTEzZWE4NzRkZTE4ZDE0YjRkNGMxOTg0YWRl"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNTRkMGI0YzJkNTRhOTQ5NDA4MzJjNTIxMTMyMGE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I very carefully grabbed the tiniest amount onto the plate as I didn’t know if putting it back would be a bad idea. And then pointed at something else. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTVhOWI3NmI2MTRmN2M4NGIyNmJmMGY5YWY1YWMw"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NTQ0OGM5MWUwZDQ4N2ViNWZkMGIyODcyMmJlYjc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yep. This wasn’t moving. So I grabbed a bit more of it onto the plate to try and cover up the fucking wiggling wor-Nope.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmIyZDg0MDRiNjRmNDJhZjhkMDUxNzQ4ZjdkMDgx"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZDI3ZDExOTM3MDQxZGI5MTkyN2MyMWJiZjU5OTU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell me Katherine, how long before your ship is fully repaired? I hope the damage from the battles wasn’t too much?” The Baron started and I nodded actually relieved as it meant I didn’t have to try and eat any of this.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDI3Y2JhNzM0YTQzZGI5MDQzZjZjMWY5ODg1NGY5"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYjBhNDc5ODU5MjQ3MzY5NzdiNTMyNDA2MmZhOTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know. It could be a while. I have everything I need now to complete the next expansion. So I’ll likely do that first.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Expansion?” This voice came from Eugene who looked up from his bowl of squirming worm-Nope. Bowl of Nope.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjllNTM1MjQxOTQxOTBiNWU1NDVhMWJkMzFkNjY0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMzYzYmZhNzVjMTQ1ZGM5NjE4M2IyZTk1MDJkNWNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You plan on making her even larger?” Eugene asked, sounding interested.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh yes. The current floorplan had both of the sides cut off due to some… constraints. It’s missing basically all of her crew quarters, and additional weapon sections. Thanks to the Pirate ships, I have everything I need to finish her.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aha! I knew there was something off with the design! It was left unfinished!” Eugene crowed out seemingly quite happily, and I noticed his Babbit peeking over his shoulder, and I gave her a wave.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjBjYmFiOWVlMjRiYjE4NDMwOWVjOWE1MGEyOTgy"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ODFiNGI2NjFiZTRjNmE5ZjI1NDgyZTUxMzE2MGRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh? How many more weapon systems will be available? I had considered the ship to be undergunned for its size.” The Baron asked, between a sip of whatever he was drinking. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…” I trailed off because… Did I want to just tell him? I shook it off. He would know no matter what, it wasn’t like I could install the weapons stealthily. It wasn’t impossible to hide weapons when they were installed, but moving equipment into position and installing it would be obvious to the Octavius. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWFiZTU4Y2Q1NjQwYmY5MWNjYmY5ZmZjNWFlYjQw"> </p>
<p class="cnNkOWI2MGRjYjFhYTRiMjY5NjI4OGY1ZTYwM2Q1NmMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well first I’m going to install some laser batteries. A quad battery along the side, and then a few smaller AA turrets. Missiles aren’t fun to deal with.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed. The Octavius will be getting some missile defense retrofits as well after what happened.” The Baron grumbled, and for a moment, he wasn’t the powerful noble, but a man in his twenties pissed that someone had damaged his ship.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWVhODIzYzNiODRhODg5ZGM0MjYxYTUzZTM3NWQ4"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOTA0Mjk1YmNmOTQ0YjA4MGVmMTliOTMwYWJiMWM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a bit of camaraderie with him for a moment, and then he looked back at me, and spoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWExMjFkZWYzODRhOTlhMDE3M2M0Y2NkMzc4Nzk0"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“But is that all?” He asked, almost too casually. His eyes told me he was digging for information, and luckily for him he was going to get it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzBmZmNmY2M3MjQyMjdhMmMxZWQ4YjE4OThkNmFm"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZTgwZDQzZDA5OTRmM2ViNzhiZjU4YTJlNWI0MmU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pop up missile racks. Missiles are expensive, but in emergencies they’re valuable.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed they are!” This time the military officer Hamlin spoke up, the man nodded seriously after his declaration. “If you need to source some ordinance, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Finding missiles is not a difficult task, finding missiles that function often is!” He offered and the Baron raised a glass in the air to that earning chuckles around the table.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjYzYmQxMTU0ZTRkYmY5ZTdiY2U1MzY4MzZmNDIw"> </p>
<p class="cnMyM2ZjYTYwYWZjNDQzODg4YTBhZjZlZTk5Yzg3ZWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll keep that in mind.” I agreed with a smile. They were scary but most of the actual officers were pretty nice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDQzNGVkZDgxZjRjNjg4ODI3MGEyOTg5NmExNWNk"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MTk2NDY4MTE4NDQ3MDY5MDQ5NTE4NWUxY2MyZTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of drinks. I looked over at the glass of… Whatever that was beside my food, and reached for it so people would stop asking me some questions for a moment.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjQyMTFkMGE4NjRkMTBhODViN2ZjZDFkY2M5ZjBl"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZTE3Zjg1YTUzODRkMzc5YjcyNjU0ODdjODNjMWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a sip and put it back down smiling fakely as I fought the desire to puke. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTQ4ZDk5ZjY4NzQ4OTJhNTdhZjE3YTE4OTZiZGQ3"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MzhjYzA5OTcyNDQ4ZTZiOWI2ZGZkYmJhZjdkMjI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">It tasted like cough syrup. Flat cough syrup.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjM2ZjlkNmEwYjRkNTdiNGJiN2E3YzMwNzg1ZDA3"> </p>
<p class="cnM4M2MyMjQ3NzJlYjQ3NWQ5NGYwMTk0NGRlZjRiOTc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The only good thing was that it wasn’t alcoholic at least.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTkzNTBjMGJlODQ3NTJhMzQ2Y2FhZDQxODRjMjE3"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NjBlNjAxYTYyODRhYjQ4Y2E4OWNjMmYzYzcwMGNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a sinking feeling that I wasn’t going to enjoy this meal very much.</span></p><span class="cjM2YTc1NjhmZmE4YTRiNjRhNjYyZGM4OTI3MWFmZWY5"><br/>Unlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM5NWM2ZDRkYTNlNTQ0ODZiNzA3NWVjYWJlNGRiZTQz"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ODg4ZDVmNjBhYzQ2NWM4Y2E2ODIyNmVkY2QwMmM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, conversation was stalled out as Eugene cut in.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGQ1NmM2NTczNzQ5YjQ5MzlmNjA4NjkyZmQyMTQ0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NmI2ZGFiYzQ4MDRhNTY5MTlmZGU2OWZkZjExMjVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So the SDA for your Phantom. Outside of the calculations which are the most complex parts, you made it out of just a few Warp Arrays?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s more complicated than that.” I offered, which he nodded already understanding. “But mostly true. The Warp Control Arrays already function as an SDA Controller… If you don’t have a working Warp Array, then when you drop into subspace…” I trailed off and Eugene nodded, but he added for those around the table. Not all of which were engineers.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzhiNGRiYjczODQzYjU5MDNhN2U0ZTc1NjA2YmEw"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNGQxNDk2NTcwNDQ2OTM5ZjUyNzMxNTRjYTRhYmFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You drop deeper into subspace constantly without one. Technically you could still escape if you break your ship's rift bubble, but it’s much more dangerous, and it’d be a rocky re-emergence.” He said and earned some nodding heads. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzFmZWYyZGRmNTRjODg5MzEwZDk2OTJjMjYwYWUy"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOTUwNjkwYTVhNzQ4YzZhMWEwNDFmZWU4ZTc3OTMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">But the obvious question was still there so I spoke it. “So I took multiple Warp Arrays and fixed them up and combined them, so they’d have at least enough processing power to handle the actual calculations from another source. Most of it is done on board the Phantom Stars computer, but that’s not really amazing either. Just some modules I’ve scrapped over the years.” I ended up mumbling a bit towards the end as more and more eyes were locked onto me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2VkMjEwZTQ3NjQ5Y2Y5MmUzMGQzZmU5Y2QzNDAz"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do go on Captain. I’m truly fascinated.” Eugene urged me, and I nodded. It was kind of embarrassing to talk about salvaging garbage when I was surrounded by so many really rich people.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2NjOTRhZGU3MDRiN2Y4MDBkNjc0NWU4NDU4MjVl"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNDA4YjFjMjU5NzRlM2JhZWRjMzY4NTI0ODgxNzg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well my Crabbit, and my ship's computer, and the Warp Controllers, all work together to handle the calculations. Well… The calculations were a bit off. Which is why it nearly shook me apart when I used it… I should be able to fix that, probably.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed! I can’t even imagine. The calculations for entering subspace are difficult by themselves. I studied the best courses in the entire Duchy, and I can assure you the math is well beyond me.” He said looking at me with an eye that spoke of how serious he was. And…</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTJmYzk0YjFjNDQwZWI4MzFhMDUzMGQzMmM5M2E4"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZGJkMTI1MTI5ZDRlNTFhYTgxNDE5ZjYwNDJlMzQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well just like the baron there was greed there. The desire to have what I had.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjJhNjVjN2U3YzQ4MWViN2ZlMDQzNWRjOWE3YjY0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNDc3MjFjYjUwMDQzNmE4MWEyNTFlZjRjZTNhZjZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded and fake sipped at my drink. As we had talked I’d grabbed a few things from the table and finally found something mostly palatable. Some sort of meat dish, that I was pretty sure was actual meat, and not just manipulated protein. I of course had no idea what sort of protein it was. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2UwYWIxOTVmNjQ2YzBiZWEyNzEzM2VlODcwZWRi"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYTViNjJmMGZlYTRhMzNiNjcxMmEyZGIwODk3YTNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just… Kept working on it, until I figured something out.” I said, which was technically the truth. Mostly I had just listened to the song as it guided me in making a functional SDA controller.</span></p>

We should be getting visitors again soon!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay… That’s nice?” I asked, because I mean, we always had visitors before and it wasn’t a big deal then.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzA2Y2Q5YzljODQ3NWZhZTQzYzViYjMzOGQ2Mzll"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MzEwYTNjOTBlMzQ0ODI4ZmM5NjM2MmFjY2U3NmEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Silly! You have a ship now! You should start thinking about your crew!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want-” I cut myself off. That wasn’t entirely true. I did want crew, but I wanted people that I would actually like. “I’ll keep that in mind, but I’m going to be pretty picky about crew.” I said and Marie rolled her eyes before reaching up and poking my cheek.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2M4ZWYzMWNjODQxNTNhMDhjNTNhYTI3Yjc4MGUw"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOWZkODAzMTQ2MTQ5MTliNjA5OWMwODMxYzk2OTdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course you are! You’re the most socially awkward person I know!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not socially awkward! I just like doing my own thing!”</span></p>

<p class="cnM2YjhjZGQwZDQ2NDQyOTY5M2Q2MTRmMjk4NThkMzg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Suuuure.” She teased out and I huffed at Maries laughter as she jerked her head. “C’mon let’s get some food, and I can fill you in on all the gossip you’ve missed.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of it?” I whined, because I never paid any attention to the station gossip.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxMTJjZGQyZDk1MjRmNjdiYmQxMjBmOWVmNzI1Njgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">And there was a lot of it. The fact was almost everyone on the station was family. And family members loved to share gossip.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNlNDQzODc1NmYwYjQ1ZDA5YWNjMGQ0NGFlNWQyNjA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Brat.” Aunt Sheila called out, surprising me and I stalled out on my rapid pace towards the air locks.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTFlNGM2ZDNjNzRhZTZhODc2ZjA2ZTZhOWY3MWNm"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYTRhMWU0NThiMzRhMWVhZWE5NDM0OGRjNzNkM2I4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aunt Sheila, what’s up?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGVlODIzZDMxMTQzY2Q5M2E4MDRmNzVmYjdiMjlh"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMmZlYWQ1OTk3ODRhZjFhZGE0YzBlMGE4ZjM0NWJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before you run off, I’d like a second.” She called out and I shifted my path, turning towards Aunt Sheila's little shop area. I followed her back in, and noticed that a lot of the scrap that once was scattered across the ground was now gone.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWUwMDk5ODhiNjQzMjhiMmE5NzBmNzgyNjcxN2U1"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMDgzY2Y1OTYwZjRlMGFiYmUyZDgzNzYyZmZhODk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The war had been a constant drain on all the resources on the station. Sure we still had plenty of food and water, the military transports with food hadn’t been affected, but we were sending out basically all of the valuable scrap we had. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWE4ZjU3ODMyZTRhNjRiMWMzNDM4Y2MwN2Y0NjUz"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMDMyYzQ1YTZkMzRmMGE5OGIxMGQzYzI4NzZiZTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well everything but the stuff I had picked out for the Phantom Star from the pirate ships before they had been cleared out and sent on their way.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzVlMWVjYWFhYjQxYTBhMGQxMDEyNTk3OTA2ZmY2"> </p>
<p class="cnNlOTljMGM1NTRkOTQ5OWJhNGVkZmVjNThlYjRmYTJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ve got a problem.” She started as she stopped at her store counter and dropped into a chair, I noticed instantly she was tense, her fingers tapping away on the steel as if nervous.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTBmMDQyODZhMTRkMTJhNWNkMDk1ZDBjYTBmMWMw"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OGNhZmQxZDIxMDRjYzM4ZjFhY2JjY2NiY2Y3Mjg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m serious Kat. I just finished talking to Uncle Kyle. He asked me to talk to you about this, since he thinks I have a closer relationship with you. That’s how serious it is, he’s trying to use our relationship to get you to do this.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do what?” I asked instantly, because yeah, this was sounding serious.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzI4NWQwYTY0ZTQxMzFiZmMwZjYzZjc4YmY4NmVm"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNmYxMTIwMGM4OTRmMzFiMjk1Yzg3ZmJjMThiNmEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have a supply shipment, the merchant who was supposed to transport it disappeared. You heard?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really… I haven’t talked to Marie in a while.” I admitted and that actually earned me a snort from the older woman. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGY0NjA0YmFjMzQ2NjRiNmJiZDI1NmFiYTc3NTNk"> </p>
<p class="cnM2OTA3ZWRiN2JmOTQzYTA5MTAxODNjNGZhNTgyZWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah that tracks. Been hiding away in your ship?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not hiding… I do have a Captain's Quarters… It’s bare bones, but-”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you don’t have to defend yourself Kat, C’mon. You think if I had a ship I’d be sleeping on station?” She asked and I shrugged and she finally shifted from her seriousness into a laugh. “Ah, you're such a funny girl. Alright listen here’s the deal, and why I’m the one asking you. We need this deal. The longer we wait the more likely it slips through our fingers. Let’s just say the station has been getting sidelined for some parts that we need thanks to the war, and this was our chance to finally get them. We got the start of a deal, but transport became an issue, and a dealer like this is more likely to sell the goods if we can’t pick up.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDkyZjNiOTYzMTRmYTJhNzlmYWEwY2RhZjIzN2I4"> </p>
<p class="cnM5Y2E4ZDgxYTQ1OTQxYTRhYmZlZTczMDU3ODA2ZjVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, so it’s important… And you obviously need a ship to go get the parts, but?” I asked, because if it was just that, Uncle Kyle could have asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTA3MDAyNDYzNDQxMGRhOTM0N2NkY2M0YWIxNDNj"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMDNjOThmMWY5ZTRkNDc5ZjE1MmMwYTU2ZmY1MDEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hell I’m actually kind of excited to go out and travel a bit even if the Phantom Star isn’t finished. I wouldn’t get into a fight, but her hangar space is still there, and she can jump into Subspace without problem. So a short trip to get some missing supplies sounded… Fun.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay I’ll be straight. The shipment is large, not a huge issue, but we’d need someone that can speak on behalf of the station… We’d be requesting you take a few people with you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.” I denied instantly, my hackles rising. “She isn’t ready for more people!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know Kat.” Aunt Sheila said, hands raised and waving to calm me, and I only felt my desire to run from this conversation grow all the more. But I didn’t. “I know you aren’t comfortable with it. Hell, you’ve told me, your ship doesn’t even have the crew quarters built in yet, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGY1ZWM5ODg1MjQxYjNhNWI2MWFlNzliNWFlNThj"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I get why you’re uncomfortable, but we don’t have anyone else to ask. Merchant transports haven’t been coming through just yet. It’ll be another month or two before word spreads that we are open again, and anyone bothers to stop by… Merchant captains don’t like stopping in a system and being told to leave because the station is in lockdown. It hurt our contacts.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh yeah, happens every time we have to lock down. Some captains won’t come back again, some it’ll take a while. Think about it kid. It can sometimes be days, or even a week out of a captain's way to visit us, so for them to arrive only to find out the station is on lockdown?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah I wouldn’t come back again either.” I muttered. That’s something I’d have to keep in mind. While it didn’t cost anything really to travel with modern Iris Drives providing infinite power. There were still costs. Time, repairs, food and more. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjk5NjE5ZjBiNTQzYzdhZjk1MTU1Njc5OTExNGE5"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OWY2YjY1YzkxZjQ2MTM4NzgzZDU3MmM4ODc2YzJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Travel wasn’t arduous, but it was still travel.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTFkNzZiOGU4YjRmMjhiNmFlMjhkMjgwOTA2MjE0"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZmUzMDQ2YmNkMTQ1YmViZjU2YWYyYTdlODI5NjA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So we need you. We’re willing to pay. Uncle Kyle is willing to be generous… For what we have anyways. Just to temper expectations.” She said the last bit apologetically.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTJiMTUxNTJmYTRhY2ZiMjExMDQyY2ZhMjQ5YWU3"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NmE1OTQxODRkNzQyMjI5ZTBiZDM0Y2VhODdhZWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded, really just wanted to wring my hands. I didn’t like it! I didn’t like it at all. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2Y2OTJkYTAwYzQyZTJiYWY3YjliNjA5YTk1NzYx"> </p>
<p class="cnNmOTk4NTBmZDlhMDRmZTg4YWY2NGRiYTFhOWM4MTQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-who would be going?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… Uncle Kyle is thinking of giving little Carter some responsibility. It’ll be him as leader, along with Collin to back him up and handle anything and a few hands.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzYyNzZhNGQ4MzQzNjA5OTQxNjZjN2ZlZTljNmNj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NWI3YTczZTI5YTQ1YzRiMTQ3ODFiNWM3YzAzYzJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I blinked at that combination. Old Collin’s bad attitude usually meant he was kept away from any sort of diplomacy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjNjZGFlYzhhNzQyOGViNzlkOTQ5NWQ3NjRkMTll"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNDNhYmZlYTM1MjQwZGY5YzIyNTMwZmMyZWY1MGY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t give me that look. Collin knows his shit. Besides, he’s there to be Carter's backup. If Carter messes up, we’ll need a hardass to fix it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gotcha.” I said and then sighed, reaching up and scratching at my messy hair with my gloved hand. I really didn’t want people on my ship. She wasn’t ready! “I don’t even have everything set up for more people… My toilet is already…” I started and Sheila just laughed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2U3Yzg5YzZjNjQ0YjE5YWQzOGQ1YTBlMzllNTZj"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYTNiNzI2YzRlMDRmMDRhZGI1NzE3ZGZkNGQ5ZWZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen Kat. It’s your ship, and your choice. I’m of course of the opinion you should help out, but it’s up to you. But, and take this as honest advice? You’re the captain. If you want them shitting out of a bucket and chucking it out into space, then that’s your decision.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmY5YzY3YzZhNjQ4ZGJhNzcxZGY4ZmM2NTFmNDY0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZjMyMTY0MjI0OTQ1MTViMDE2NGFkY2Q3MTM1MzNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t!” I said wrinkling my nose and Aunt Sheila just laughed harder. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWRjMzRiMTYyNDQ0ODJiNTJjNzc3OTgwYjQ0OTJh"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MDFmYmY1YTkwNjQ3YWY4YTk4NzNjYjRhZmEzNzFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well if you accept, it doesn’t have to be right away. Give it some time to fix up what you need, or even drag them into working for you if you need it. Could install some emergency toilets wherever you plan on setting them in. You don’t need to overthink it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll… I’ll think about it.” I said, definitely going to be overthinking it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Just let me, or Uncle Kyle know once you’ve made a decision… We do need this Kat.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWQ5MjRhNTA2MzQyZDNiNjk4ZjE1ZjEzMWM0MGNm"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMjE2NWQ4MDJlYzQ5NTU5NTc4MTY0NTA2MmNjNTQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… Got it.” I said and turned to escape. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWQ4NjZjZTM5NzQxMzM4YzhhNzM0MTU3OWNjNDJk"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NWUxNmI2MmI1YTQzZmI5ZjY3NzQ1NmVjODQzNjc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was I going to do now?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmZmNzZiNTY1ZTQxYzg4YTMzYTIyOTE5NjUxYzU0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNzdiMzFlN2NjYzRmYzQ4N2EzYzU4MGNkMDU1MGZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTkwNTFhNGM0NzRkYjRiZTc2YTA5OTNmMDI0Y2Y3"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MzAwOWUwZDk3YzQyZjE5ZjNhZGM5YTZjNTI4Zjk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I traveled back to the ship, all the while as I drifted through space helped around by the Crabbit on my shoulder I considered what was going on.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWY4ZjQ5NWFkODRhNzJiNjQ2YzM3NjUxYWE2ZjY4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0M2U4ZGMyMjBiNTQ2YWQ5MzA5NDM2NDU0OGUwNmEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Travel sounded fun. Sure the Phantom wasn’t ready yet, but just a transport job sounded pretty fun. A flight out of system, give myself a chance to really test warp travel on my ship, but…</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGQxMDJkNmFkNTQ4NDdhYmFhZDk5ODRjZjRhMDIy"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMTgwZjc4ZmUwODRmZDVhNDk1ZTgyMGZmOTVlZDcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I didn’t want to have other people around! I’d have to lock down the engine room and make sure no one could get in. I’d have to find some way for them to live. Hell, my own quarters were basically an empty room with a toilet, near the bridge. I didn’t even have the rest of the bathroom installed. I had skipped all the pleasantries trying to get the ship combat ready.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWNjMjE5ZjY1NzQ1YTdiNGRmODllNzY1NDAzMmE4"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZGZjNjFmMDdlMjRhZmNiY2VlYThlMzhlZTRiNjQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I still had a shitty chair too.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTk0ZTBkNTVkZDQ3MTI4MGM2N2Q0OGFlNjliYzYw"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZDUxMzg0YWQwZTQzZDk4MWUyN2MxNmZkMjkwNTUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">So if I was going to bring people along… The hangar would be the best space. There just wasn’t enough finished room on the ship to have anyone wandering around.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmNmODk5YjhmNzRmYzU4OWRiYzVmYmIxODI0YmVh"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYTEwMzMyYzVkYTRkNzdhOTA5MGJlMDM0ZDdjMGJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">As I floated I realized I had already come to the decision to help out. I was running through what I would need to make the trip actually safe for people. Instead of ways to say no. The hangar would need the lights double checked most of them weren’t installed. I’d need sleeping space, and food. Water.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjg5NDVkYTcyZjRkYzZhYzhjNWU2YTEyMTY3NjBj"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNDgzZGVhZjYyNjQ4ZTg5MzBiN2QzMzViNjg1YzU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Uuuu.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4YjQyYzgzY2U1MDRiOWM4NTkzM2Y0MDkwYTQ0OGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">As I floated I pulled out my Tab and started checking the work orders.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTliNjUxNzQzODRhZjc5YzlkNWI5YTE3YTg4OGM3"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NWQ4MTlmNWEyMTQ1ZDdiZDkxNzA0Y2RlNWIyZjFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t entirely followed to a T by the Crabbit, sometimes things needed to be done in a different order as situations came about. Yet, now I would have to add even more to the seemingly endless list.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDk1YWRkODRkYTQzYzBhYjRhMTMyYjJlNGYwMmFk"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNDRiMzU1YzcxOTQ3YTE5NTljYmUzZjI2ZWJiMGYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached the massive hangar ship and floated in through the forcefield enjoying the feeling of gravity returning as I fell onto my feet and looked around.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDFhMjIyM2NlODQ2MTBhZmUwYTdiNDg5YjlmN2I1"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you guys playing again?” I asked, because the Crabbit were all flying around not working.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWJiYWEwMzg0MDRiNDNiZTIyODM3NWY1NjVmM2Vl"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bully! Kaaaat! They are bully!” One of them screamed as she raced over and buzzed around my head and it only took a moment to notice that her backside had a big red streak of paint.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjg5YjM5ODM5NTQ0M2RhNmYxMGQyM2VkMWU3OGM1"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMDM0MzRhZGFmZTQ2MjZhZWM5NThiZDdjMGRhOWFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Slow down, slow down, why are they bullying you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Trouble!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makes more work! Worst worker!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Clumsy! Clumsy!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWRmZjIwNTE0MzRmNGQ5ZDRmMWVkMzg2Mzc3ZGQy"> </p>
<p class="cnNmOTM1Y2ViZmI0NDQxMzI4Yzk5ZDAwZjhlNDVhN2Ey"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey!” I called out as the crowd gathered around me. “That is being a bully. Stop that.” I told them and looked at the Crabbit that was floating behind me peeked out around my head to wave her hand at the others.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWVhM2I2MDBhYjQ3YzlhZDY0Mjk1ZTIzYzI2NDQw"> </p>
<p class="cnM0M2UzYzNjMDgxODRhNWFhM2FiZmE3ZjNmODU1MzEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Blegh!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey don’t start it either.” I warned, but I had to ask. “Why do you have a red streak on your back?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Red Zone! She’s a red zone! Danger!” One of them called out and I felt my jaw drop.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmQ5MDhmMzQ4YjQ4YzNiOTM3ZmUyZjM5ZDdiYmM1"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not what Red Zone means! You can’t label anyone a Red Zone!” I called out. Okay this is my fault. Should have made sure they understood what a Red Zone meant a bit more clearly before I left it for them to figure out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2FlMzcxNWQ5ZjQzYjNiMTg1NzZiNmE4YjI5YTUx"> </p>

<p class="cnNlZjdhNjYwNjUxNjQ5ODc4ODIwMWQyYWE5OTIyN2E3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He also fucked up, so he’s our whipping boy during the trip.” Old Collin said abruptly and smacked Marshall on the back of his head earning a yelp. “This trip isn’t meant to be a reward for him.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWU1Y2EyNzM2NjRiMmQ4NmRlZjA1MDY5ZDY2MDBi"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZjQyMTkzMjFkYTQ5YzZhNzE0NTBkZGEzZDhhODE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took that in for a moment, my obvious unhappiness on full display. Yet, it was Marshall who didn’t react besides rubbing the back of his head that surprised me. I expected some sort of aggravated exclamation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDRjOWYyYWEzZDQwN2U4M2NiMDhlOWMzZjI5ZTg3"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMmEzOTg5NGNhZjRlNDg5YzRlNjkyMTQ2YThiMzI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I shifted from him to Marie. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWEzNTA5YWM3MzQ4Njk5OGQ1ODBiZDkwMmY3ODU5"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you coming?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m logistics Little Kat. If we need to make any deals, I’ll be the one to handle accounts and things.” She explained proudly and even threw me a wink.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjE5MmVkOGZkMTRmODg5MjVlZjU5YTVmODBlODgw"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZTQ5ZGU4MDQ5NjQ4NDM5NThhMjNiY2U5MWY3NDU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine.” I grumbled accepting her presence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjdjYWIwNzgxNDQ5NjhhMzc2ZDgzMjRmYWRlNmU1"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYzIyMjk5NzdlYjQ4ZWVhZDdmZmNhMzM1NTVhZDhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… The Hangar door is open.” I explained and then shuffled a bit as Carter was just looking at me, and Marie then spoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGM2YWEzNjNhYjQ4YjA4NGU1ODRmZTk0N2M5ZGFj"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon Little Kat. I’m not going on a spacewalk to drop off my stuff.” She said pointing at the bag she had at her feet. They all had a bag like it… My shoulder slumped. There goes the easy way.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjZjYzg3ZmJiYjQ5ZmM4YTFjZDk2YmRiZjc0ODk5"> </p>
<p class="cnNmOWZiZTU3YjdhYTRmMDk4MzBiYmVlZGI1NzdkMTU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine… C’mon follow me, and only follow me. The ship isn’t complete, and don’t go exploring. If you are caught anywhere I’m going to throw you off the ship.” I said firmly and Carter nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjUwZWQ2YjBhMzRmOGE4YzdiYWVhMDI4YzYxNmNl"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYmI1ODA2ZmM3YzQ4ZDc4OGY3ZWU5Y2I3YmMwMmYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll make sure such a thing doesn’t happen.” He offered and I just shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTY1Yzc2Yjk2YTQyMDdiZGYwNmFjNWI0MTVhZTFk"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NDZmMjgzNzhlNjRmYTFiZjUxOWRhZjY5YzJkM2My"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a breath and then turned around, but didn’t make it more than a step before Marie was there, shooting her arm through mine.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTZjYzkwNjAyNTQ4MjFiOThmZGJhM2Q4NzA3NDg4"> </p>
<p class="cnNhN2ZiYWI2OTRkMzRiZDY5NTc5ODJhN2MxZjlhNDFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon little Kat. Don’t be down. I know you’re still fixing it up, but I’m so excited to see your ship! I’ve never been off station before you know? So show me around.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I grumbled a bit but walked back through the airlock and waved off the swarm of Crabbit. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTk1NDU0ZDNhNTRhODA5NzU5MDgxOGMyNmE4ZDg3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmN2Y3MWUxOWY2ZDRkYzc5MjNlOWQyODYyNmQ2Yzgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geeze Kathy, think you have enough drones?” Marie asked as the Crabbit filled up one of the hallways that split off from the airlock.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzk0MmY1NWJjMDRhY2NhYzBjYTI1ZGM5ZjczNTI3"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MDhiMWZlYTYyNDQwNGM5NDdjYWQzMjk3YzVjZWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re security. To make sure no one tries going somewhere they shouldn’t.” I said making sure to speak loud enough that everyone could hear me. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDYxODdiYzUwMjRlYmM5NGQyNDkwYWE0NTFjMDBm"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMjQ0MWMyZTVlOTQ3OThhZDlmM2QzNzM3NTRjNzA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Old Collin offered a grunt seemingly agreeing and then pushed Marshall forward. Marshall turned to glare but Collin just threw up an eye brow as if daring the boy to try it, and Marshall slunk forward.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTkwMDE2MGYyYzRmMmNiNjgxMDQ3MjJjN2IyNDgx"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZWE1MDI5M2Q0NjRiMDBhNWE2MGUxNTNjODYxZmQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon the Hangar entrance is this way, you’ll have to take the ladder though. Freight elevator doesn’t exist yet. Or any stairs.” I offered and then we turned a corner into one of the hallways and the absolute mess of it made me twitchy. “Just be careful about the cabling, and don’t fall into the holes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Relax Little Kat. This isn’t that bad." Marie said with a gentle smile as she started moving her way through the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmVmYjk5N2RlYTQ1OThiZmIyZTI4OGE2Y2FkYjJk"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NmJkNjY5YjAzMTRhMTk4OWY1NjNmYzk2MDQzNmZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Girls right, I’ve seen worse.” Old Collin said and that was that. Everyone sort of clambered through the hallway until we reached the ladder that led down into the bottom of the ship where the hangar was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWQzNDNkYzFkOTQ1YzViZGQ5NjUzYWFhZmRmM2Jh"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZmMwNDgxYjU2OTQ3MDY4YWZiNDg4ZWJlYjY1ZmIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then when I made sure everyone was down first I followed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDA2OWM5NzAzYjRmZjU5NTZlOWFmM2NiZGNjOTdh"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZWY5YTc2Njk0NTQ3NzU5NDNhZmQ5Nzg4Y2VkNjcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hangar door was open with the forcefield active and I joined them at the bottom and slowly relaxed as they all looked around the large open space.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmVkNWVmZGY3ZDQxZmE5MmE0NjY2OWQ2NWJlZmM3"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZmJmYTkxYzdlMTQ1OTk5NDMwZWNhZmU4MjIyODg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well this is it then! We’ll bring everything over, but get used to it kids, this is your home for at least a week.” Collin called out as he walked over to the section with the sleeping pods and dropped his gear.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah yeah.” Marshall grumbled but otherwise everyone seemed fine with the space, and I showed Marie where I had already installed some storage spaces for them, she dumped her bag inside the cubby and then looked around.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGZkMzIxZDA0ZDRiMDRhNzExY2Y1MWFiM2Y1YTAz"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MDZmNjBkZGRlZDQ5ODk4NjA0ZjkxM2U0ZmUzODVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bathroom?” She asked and I nodded walking over to one of the walls with a newly created door, and popped it open. Inside were four more doors in a hallway that would lead to four toilets, because it wasn’t really any harder to make four considering the piping was the hard part.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTY3MTBjZmJjNjRkNmJiNmRkNTgwYmFmMzhlZDdk"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMDFkNGVhOGRiOTQyODJhMDA0NDc2NzIxODRmMTM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the bathroom, four toilets just in case. Please don’t make a mess.” I pleaded and she smiled and laughed. Then I pointed towards the end of the small room. “That’s a shower room. Sorry they’re a bit close together for piping reasons. So it might be a bit awkward, but the shower room has a lock.” I explained to Marie who flashed me a smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTIyMDk5M2M5YTQ4ZGRhMWQ3MThiOGM3YjkxNWVj"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NWIwY2ZkODhhYTQ0YTQ4ZTY2MWVmYWQwZGFmNDM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn’t known if it was going to be all boys or who would be coming so I set it up for mixed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzkzNzYwZDRhYjRhYWZiYzI4NWJlN2U3MGJiNzFh"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MjM3NDkyM2NlYzQ4YmY5NjI5ZTVhNWUzMjZhMzg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was that. I watched as everyone got their stuff situated, and then headed back to the station to start transporting the beds and other cargo they would need.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTM1ZDg5ODgzZDRjZWE5ODExMjUyZTY2MmFjOTVh"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNTQ4MWZkZDY4OTQ0NGI5NjdhNTJiNWUxZDQyNzg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">We’d be leaving in the morning.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNkNWI5NTQ5MTRhZTRkOWRhZjhhMDYwOTQzMWY4ZmE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. Everyone is secured?” I asked, looking around the Phantom Stars hold. Double checking everything was in place.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDE2ZjIxNWEwNTQ2OGNiNjExMzVhY2JjODlmN2Uy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NTBlY2Y4OWVhYjRlZTFiMjdiN2VhOWMyYTUyYTAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We got it Captain.” Old Collin said, speaking formally much to my surprise. “Everything is locked down and ready for the trip. We’re set for travel.” I took the words and nodded, my back straightening as the time was now. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWI3ZDE2YTJmODRiODQ5ZThiZmFiNGZjMDJmNDI0"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMjliYWJlZGE1NDQ4YzBhMjU1NjM2MGZhMjVmYjkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. We are setting off. Call me through the Crabbit if you need something.” I said, to the small group and I got nods and a thumbs up and a wink from Marie. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDIxNzVhMjgxOTRkZjlhYmZlODkyZmNmZTM1OWVl"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YWQzNTc0MTM1NDQ5MDM5ZWIxNjhlOWZiMmI0NTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned and climbed up the ladder, sighing in relief once I was out of the hold and back in the Phantoms holds. I closed the hatch behind me and walked much more calmly up to the bridge.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmZhYTdmMzJkMDRlOTdiZmIwODhjZGY5OTIyNzAy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YjBmYjI4YTEzNzQ4NGVhYmU5ZDllYTZhNGYzZTVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is everything ready?” I asked, my current shoulder Crabbit. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTk5MzNkNTYwNzQ5OTU5Yzk4ZTExOTJkNmI1NDA3"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MjdjNTJhMTRjMDQ5YmNiODUyMTJjNzQ4ZmM1YjA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes yes! All ready! Green Green!” It chirped happily and I nodded. Did the Crabbit decide to start using colors for the status of things? I’d have to check with them once we were going to see what they had come up with. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmE2NzE0YTFiNTRlZjNhNzkyOTc1MjQyZTBlMmVi"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYTg4N2JhOWQ3YTRhYjE4OWRkZDdkNTE1MmVjODc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wouldn’t do to think Green is a good color only for it to mean everything was on fire.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTUyYTcyZWViNjQzOWRiYTZmOTU4N2IxMmE5MTQ3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkY2Y5MmZiMzVjZDQyOWNiMWVhODU2OGIzYjA0NWY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I climbed up into the bridge a few moments later and happily flopped into my uncomfortable chair. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmI2YTRkZGI1MTQwYmRhOGIxYTNlMzc3ZWNjNjIx"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NTAzNjc4YjljZTQ1NDk4MWRkZWRjNjA5ZDZiMDQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright! Prepare final checks for departure, secure all hatches!” I called out playing into the role, enjoying how the Crabbit all cheered and got to work.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDhiMmMyNjBhOTQ0YzE4MzYxZTBiZGRjMThhMjVi"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYjg2MGZmMmZmZDQ3NTg4Y2MxYmM0ZTYxM2RiNjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Captain! Message message!” My shoulder Crabbit who had switched over to comms called out and I slumped.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDY1OTA1ZjhmOTQ1YzNiMTMwNmJmYjUyYzViZjhm"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNzM3NGQ3NjMzNjRkMDViNzFjZGFmNWMxYjRlZjNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I did a check on my Tab and blinked. I expected a message from Uncle Kyle, but this was from the Octavius. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjQxOWRiZDE2MjRmYmI4N2RhOWQ4OWU0NDRlZDcy"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYjhjZmVmODZjOTQ5MWI5YzAwZmQ0MWI5MGVhN2Q4"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was my anxiety again. I took a breath and let it out. Was he calling to cause me issues? Make demands? I had no idea, so there was no point in waiting and wondering.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjJiOTlhMjNjMzQxMDNiODVmZjY0NjIxYjU0ZjE5"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZmZmNTk1NmRiZDRiMGQ5ODM4YmE5M2NkMzQ4ODBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I tapped the request, and put it through.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWRjNDVkMzRiODRlOTFiZmM1ZmMwMWE4ZmJiZDA1"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZGU4MTM4MDJmYjQ2NzY5MmZjMTZhZmVkMmM4OWJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later an image of the Baron was on my Tab.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODg0NzYxMmNmMzQxYTRiYmRlZmE2MTZiN2Q2NWJk"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMDg5OTYxZTg5MDQ2MTM4MzMxMDZkZTFhOTFjYWZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Baron?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Katherine. I heard you are traveling to Elinai.” He said with faux casualness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I wish you safe travels Captain. This is your first time leaving this system, is it not?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I wish you to take this.” My Tab chirped and I noticed I received a message from him. “It’s a seal, should any nobility give you any trouble, you can use it to assure them you are working under me for now.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think I’ll need it? I shouldn’t run into any nobility.” I offered in an attempt to deny what he was saying.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just in case Captain, just in case. I need you to upgrade the Octavius, so it’d be rather difficult if you end up stuck somewhere. So I’ll make sure no one else thinks they can hinder you unduly.” He explained and I had a feeling there was more going on, but instead of arguing I just nodded and then he nodded back. The comm channel ended a moment after.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmNjZGY5ZTgxNDRmMzA4MGM2MmYwYmQxM2FlMzgz"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMGFjNzc1YmIxYzRjNDJiMDM5YTc2ZmYxNGUzM2Fk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Weird.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTRmMjgxMzJmNjQ5ODI4Y2EyMDI1YzQwOTM3Zjgw"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MTQ2MjUxMzY3MTRlYzlhMWU5NGFkZjBmM2UwMzlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook it off, and with that, all the checks were finished, I sent a request for the airlock to disconnect to UNK-L, and I felt a tremor run through the ship as the Phantom Star was freed. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2JmMTY5OTUwZTQ4YTI5MzE0ZDdjN2VkZGE0NDk3"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMWU5M2NiZmUyYzQ2NmM5ODBkYzZkZDQxY2UzNGE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t say anything this time, just putting my hands on the Tab controls, giving the nudge to slowly pull away from the station.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODUyYjMwYTk0YjRmN2Y4MDBjMDMyZDk0NGE1Yjkz"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMDkzOWRkNzA0ZTRhZWU5YzQ3OGVkNTAwNmU1Y2E5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon I started really pushing the ship and enjoyed the way everything just disappeared behind us. I let that go for a short time to get some distance from the small Moon's gravity well that the station orbited. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDBmOWM0Zjk0NDRiYTNiZDI2YTZmY2MyZGQyYmRm"> </p>
<p class="cnNiN2E3YzA4NWIwOTQ0OTc5MWNhYTRlZjE4MzA5OGU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then finally it was time.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTA2N2FkYjRiNzQ5NDY5NTdkYTQ1ZGRjNGY3MTAw"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MDY3ZTc4YWFlMTQ2MmY5MWZlNjk3MzE2N2NkMzk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Prepare for jump into subspace!” I called out and the Crabbit quickly started working to get the calculations ready. “And let the cr-Let our guests know we’re about to jump to Warp.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes yes!” Was all I got in response, and I watched the Tab as the calculations were entered into the Warp Controller. The Controller sent back a 100% response, and so I adjusted myself in my seat and hit the button to dive.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGUzYjZkYjkxNDQ0ZjBhOTNlYjE4ZWFlYjM0MGM1"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDMzMzNlNjBjODQ0MDlhN2I1ZDk5ZjU0MGY0MDNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly my stomach felt like I was falling except it almost felt like I was going up instead of down, and the stars disappeared from view, shifting to something else, as we left real space.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDA5MjU2YjBhNTQyODJhOTlmYzdiMjVkMzY5Y2I5"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZDYyMjFiYmJlZjQ5ZTI5NWE4ZWJiNjZkNTJkNTVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t take long until we seemed to stabilize, and I nodded. “Set route!” I called out to the Navigation Crabbit and watched as it squirmed for a second pushing a few buttons before it looked back at me shyly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjA3ODY5OTZiOTQ1NmY5NDdmYzM0OGFhYzU0ZDAw"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMGM4N2Y5ODM1MzRlMTJiMTk0ZDNkOGNiYjVkMWI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Route entered! I think!” I nodded, checking it myself and not finding any issues. Pretty straight shot to the system we needed to reach. No crazy astral phenomena in the way. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWFkY2MwZTA1MjQxOTg4ZTQwNDY3YzAyZWMxYTkx"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MjgyNjBkMzBlMzRlZGY5ZGUzODNiYWQyMDI1OWYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Engaging engines.” I said and instantly the Phantom Star was moving at incredible speeds. There was no acceleration in Subspace. You were either moving, or not. And so we rocketed away at such incredible speeds it wouldn’t take long before we left the star system behind, and then only a few days as we traveled incredible distances until we reached our destination. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDhiNjc4Y2U0ZTQ5MmViNzlkYmY4OTQ2MjcxNDc3"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MjI0MGIwNzg5NTQ3OWJhNTRkYTM2ODExNTZkMmFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Planet Elinai in the Cross Industrial System. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OThlNDcxNjI4NTQxZWJiMmY4ZTc2MjdlZWYzOTM0"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYTc1ZjhmODA5ODQzYTI4MGVlYTNiODBiOGIyOTM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I rested back and just breathed in and out as I felt the Phantom vibrate slightly below me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDBjNDBkYmRiNDRmNGM5NzAyMTI5MDVhYTNmNjlm"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZDVmYjM1NGE4YTRmMzg5MDY0YmFhYTRmZDU0NGYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The song the ship had was actually syncing with the vibrational hum I was hearing. It was triumphant and eldritch, and that told me nothing was wrong. The ship was loving its trip through subspace, this time without the SDA.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTJjZmY0NmM0YzRkMjFiNmYyYzEzZDMwY2UxM2Y3"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MGJiNjhkOTg5MzQ3YzViNmVkNGJiN2YxNGI2NTkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I considered what I should do next. There were three things. Stay here and just be lazy. Get to work on some of the internals that I could fix up, or go visit my guests…</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODg5YzEzZTdmYjQwMzA5ZTUzMmM4OGNjMjk2OWJi"> </p>
<p class="cnNhODkzYTY4ZTQyNzRlMDBiZjViMzRiYzNlMzAwYjYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up. There was plenty of cabling that still needed to be installed, and I had most of it dragged on board so we could work while we traveled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmU3MTAzNGRhMjRjMjc4ZWVlMWYxN2RjNzYzNWMz"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNzhiZTY4OTU2YTRiNWFiZWQ4MDVkZDBhYTEzY2Yy"><span style="font-weight: 400">—---</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTBjNGNkNmY5MzQyMTM5MjhmNGIxYTc1M2I3OGM2"> </p>

I think he’s doing it on purpose!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I hesitated but shook my head. “There aren't any other rooms, Marie. I told you all this when you came on board. I fixed up the Hold so you could all be in there and not accidently break something!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I might not be the mechanic you are, obviously. But I still took all the courses, remember? I won’t break anything. Black Hole, I won’t even touch anything! Just a quiet room for a few hours, where I can watch my Tab without having Marshall constantly trying to watch over my shoulder, or Carter giving spoilers to things I haven’t seen yet!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I blinked, almost stepping back at her annoyance. That was… A lot.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDUyMGFhZTczNDQxYTQ5NThjZjQ0NmUxMGFkNDc5"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MjU2YzA4YzFkNDRlNDU4NzA4NDNmN2I0YzM3YmMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached up and rubbed at my nose. This was going to be a mess. I just knew it. “If I find some place for you to get some peace and quiet, I’m going to have to do it for the rest of them. That’s not happening. Marshall isn’t going anywhere on my ship.” I grumbled back at her, and Marie looked away, because what Marshall had done, had been a serious faux pas. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDFjODEwMTYzODQ3MzJiYWQ2OTFlYTE4ZWVhYTBl"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMTI4YmZhN2QxZTRlYWNhMjA2NDQ4OTI4OTlmMzU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know… But I’m not Marshall. I didn’t break your trust.” I very pointedly didn’t say anything as I looked her up and down right now, as she stood in a section of the ship I had told her to stay out of. “So please… Don’t blame me for his shit.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmNlOGNhYTE1ODQxZjJiM2I1M2Y4NWIzYTk2NTFj"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MGM5NGMxOGZjODRlMTU5M2MyOTI4OGQxNmM5Zjkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I inhaled and exhaled. I had two options. Find something to help Marie, or tell her to get back in the hold. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmRkOTY4MzlkMzQ4ZDQ5ZTU0YmY0ZjdiYWRiNjY2"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYTE0ZTU2OWE2ZTQ4ZDM4MDE2MTY4N2FjYzE3ZjZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">There wasn’t anyone to ask advice from, or make the decision for me. I was the Captain. This was my ship.</span></p>

<p class="cnM0ZTQ1NzMxMjVkNTQ3NzM4ZGNjOGY5OGYyNGFiZWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">And despite everything, Marie wasn’t just a guest, but family.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2QwMGRhYTc5MzQwZGFhYjhkZGFmNjRhNDhkNmE1"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. Get back in the hold.” I told her firmly and she blinked as suddenly she realized she was looking up at me, as I stepped into her space and guided her towards the ladder. “I’ll figure something out, but right now the ship is still off limits. My Ship. My rules. But I hear you.” I said and she looked like she might want to argue for a moment, but eventually just nodded relenting, and I watched her head back into the hold.</span></p>

<p class="cnM2MjE5MGIzZDY1NjQ4MjNiYzEzNmUyNDYxNWU1MDZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now to figure something out.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3MzJhYTZjNzNlNTRhNWNhOTA5ODMxOTk3ZDQ0YjA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest of the voyage was surprisingly quiet. I had, with some help from the Crabbit, set up an area outside of the hold. Just a small room, one I had intended in the future to be a storage room for the much larger dining area, but it was empty for now, so I had set up some space inside and was giving everyone, even Marshall as much as it annoyed me, some time every day where they could use it to get away from everyone else.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjU5NWIxNDA0MjRjNTBhY2FmM2IyMzdiNWM2ODA4"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course a Crabbit was always with them. It wasn’t like I was letting anyone actually wander around, but that suited Marie, as not only would she get her own time, but with one of the boys away it was also quieter in the hold.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmUyMGVmZDU5MDQ5YTNiZWNhNDg1Nzc4NjA3MDdh"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYzdmZjIwNjM3YzQ3OTlhMTQzMTU3ZTkzOGNmOTMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">That fixed the issue of the tension in the hold, and at least there wasn’t anything they could break in the storage room.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzYjZjYmEyZTJhZDRhZjNiZGZkZDY4MmVkYmYxY2Mx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Prepare to return to real space.” I called out using the Crabbit to relay the message through the ship, the ship intercom wasn’t installed yet after all.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkMGNlYmZkNTA0ZjQ0NWZhMDhhZjE0NDBmNmZlMjMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I took a few moments to get ready. And activated the process to leave subspace, this time without the worry about an experimental SDA system shaking me apart.</span></p>

As we settled into realspace the sensors on the Phantom Star pinged out. They weren’t the most amazing sensor system ever made. In fact considering the parts I had used they were probably worse than a normal ship.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1MGRlNGFkMGQ3MjQxN2Q4NTUzMDU4MjVmNzdkYWI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sensor display came alive, telling me just how active the system was. Hundreds of ships were coming in and out of subspace all around us. But of course space was so infinitely big none of them were actually close enough to see. </span></p>

<p class="cnNmMTFmZjNhYThiZjRiM2I5M2ZlOGI2MzBjNGVkYWFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Transition complete.” I called out through the Crabbit knowing my guests would hear it, and then I focused on the next part.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3MzJiMTVlMDkwMTRkM2RhMGY3NWI4ZTNhMDMwNzFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The first sign was a slight brightening of the Phantom Stars nose. Then a tremor ran through the ship.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhYzkxOTZmMTIxZjQ2MGFiNzk1ODIxM2M0MjYxZTAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crabbit used Gravity panels to move around. It meant in space they were completely weightless. Even with ship or station gravity, as the gravity panels sort of neutralized each other if used.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxYmRlZjI5NDY5MzRkZGViMjYzNjMyYzZjZWUxNDI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">While the Phantom Star mostly used the two Nacelles on the back of the ship to move, it did have plasma thrusters. As gravity engines weren’t as efficient in gravity wells. Those plasma thrusters were what was engaged to give the Phantom more in atmosphere control.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlZDI0YTRlMTRjYzQ4YjhiZjFmNGUxZDkzNDdjOWRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well I wanted to stay in the captain's chair in case of any issues.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzYzhiN2EyMDg5MDQ2Mjc4OTcyYTJkNDk4MDgyYjAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly I watched as the Phantom flew forward, towards an absolute mess of shuttles and ships that made beautiful trails through the sky of the city.</span></p>

<p class="cnNiZTJlNWFlMDY4MzQ4NTU5NWRkNzFhODIxYjQ4MWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just getting nervous about hitting something, when there was a gap. The flight patterns altered opening a path through. I could see the shuttles or other ships that were flying around me, and I noticed that the Phantom was one of the bigger ships, by a hefty amount. Like a shark floating through a school of fish everything shifted around the Phantom.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzNjQyNzBlZDUwMzQ3ZGY4MTg3MzI3YmUyNmEzMTcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we were passing by buildings, and I could feel the Phantom's flight grow a bit rocky as the atmosphere changed, wind picking up around the skyscrapers slammed into my ship.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1MzlkM2ZjY2U5MDQ3MTZiODRkOGVhY2UwM2VjZGNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I tugged back on the controls, slowing the Phantom Star even more as I continued to follow the flight pan. The auto pilot took my slower speeds into account as it continued on the flight path I had been given.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDAxZmQ4MTQ0MDQ3Yjk4MmYwY2E0ODAzY2E0ZGYz"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMGFhMDFjY2FiODRhMGM4NmFlYmQ2NWJlNDViNzAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we came out over a section of the city that had a ton of landing pads, only a small amount of them large enough for the Phantom, and that is where we headed. The engine whine picked up as more plasma thrust was sent down to slow the Phantom even more as we came in and shifted around cutting off more speed before slowing into a hover.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1NTJmNjExYjc1MTRlZWFhOGU1Zjk2OGUwYzVkMjkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ship shook a bit as it tried to keep itself still as it slowly dropped down the last dozen feet. Then as if all the effort to get here was just a joke she touched down with a soft sigh as the landing gear compressed, settling the ship into place without issue.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNlZjE5ZGM5YjlkOTQwYTlhNDQ2Y2RiZjFmY2VjYWIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I slipped down the ladder into the hold and rolled my eyes at the Crabbit tantrum I was witnessing here too.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDg4OWY4NTg3MDRiMGQ5ODFkNjk1ZTQxYjZiZTI2"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNDM1ODkyNjI4YzQzNWM5YjA4YWRkN2Q3Yzk5Yjg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh Kat, umm?” Marie asked, looking at the spectacle in concern.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t mind them.” I said as I walked over to the Crabbit on her back who was crying as I just flipped her with my foot.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2VlODc2NTk1NzRiM2ZiZjczZmMzYzc3NGNhN2Nk"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNjVhYzZjNmI2NzQ0MDliMzcxNzdkMjk2MzU1MjNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Nooo! Heavy!” It whined and then to my amusement flipped herself back, and continued to cry and flail.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWMwMWRkM2RjYTQ0Nzg5MDkzOWExMjU2ZGQ0NzY5"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMTFiNDM1Zjk4YzQ2ODA4NTU3N2QzNmQzMWU1NGMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey knock it off.” I warned her, this wasn’t the time for tantrums.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzEzM2I0NDI1NDQzNWJhYzUyMzM5ZDk2YWYyNjZk"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZmYwZmNlNGU2NTQyMmM4OTBiODFkZGUwMzUyOGRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu.” It whined at me pitifully, but I rolled her back on her legs again. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjliNjA5ZjA1MTRiZWJhNWYwYmM3Y2VmOWEyNzVi"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get used to the gravity, you should all sync up and practice moving like this. It’ll be important whenever we land. Go on now.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your drones are weird.” Carter said suddenly as he appeared at my side.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2MxYzE1MjI4ZTQ3MmNhODM5NzA0ODUwYzJjYTUx"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re just children… And act like it sometimes.” I shrugged it off, and instead started walking, I could hear the others follow me as I reached the rear of the hold, and I nodded. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDhiOTQ1OTQxYzRkZjBhZDc0M2M3YmM5MDAwZDY3"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNTcwMTUwMWM1ZjQ2Yjg4NzgzMjJiNTljN2RkYWZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzg5ZDQ4Y2UwYzRmZjQ5NjkzOTYzNzFhNDdiMDhh"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMWYyZmUzOGI0MTRhN2JiZWVkOTFhYTIyZTczMGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked over to an access panel, and flicked the digital lock upwards.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTZhNjAyZTU5NTQ3YjE5NTQ5ZDM3YmYxNWQ0NDlm"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NGZiODQ3OTE2NTQzMjU5NmFjNmNlZGU5NWQ4MjNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly the hold shifted lightly, the rear armored doors adjusted opening, and then a light burst into the hold.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzhjZmY3MDAwODQyZjU5YjE1MGQ5MzYxNWJlMmEy"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYzU4OWYwMmRjNzQ0OTVhZjZmOTc2NGM0ZGFhMDEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Real sunlight, slipping through the slowly opening crack as the hold ramp descended.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjE2NjVlZDE1MjQwNTE5ZjE0MzczNmNhYzYwYTNl"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMDYzNjI0YWJlODRjZDE5ZWI2NTM5MzZhNmUyYTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took in the sight and felt a smile come to my face as I had done it. Traveled across the stars and now visited a new world!</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzM3YmFjNzM3YzQzNDRiMjkxZmI3ZjI1NGE0YTM4"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMWMxYjg5N2RlMzQzZGFiMjRkOTA2NjgzZDZlMDVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">But then I jerked back my hand running up to my face, Carter was the first to cough, and we all recoiled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDI4Y2I2NzE0MzRmMjNhNTZhNzhlZmNlODhhNDFi"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMGZjYWUzZDE5NzRmNDViODhiMDI1YWM1NGU0MjRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell is that smell!?” Marie screamed as she backpedaled. I was just in shock because whoa. That was rank!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWJhNWQzNWEwZjQ1YjlhNGZjZDg5YzkwYjFiMzA4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0N2E3ZmNjZjg3ZTRhOTRiZWYzZGQ4ZmZhMWY1NWFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh. Get used to it, brats.” Old Collin offered, definitely amused at our reaction. “This is an industrial city, there are billions of people mashed together here all working in factories to produce for the whole sector. That’s the stink of a working city.” He explained as he walked past us towards the entrance, and then I felt my eyes narrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWY1NmJiN2ZhZTQ3MTg5Zjk1MjhjNTNhZjBjYzZm"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZWNkYzVjMjU3MjQ2NTU5NjY2MzJhOTk1YmNkNmZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have your suit forcefield up. You’re using stored oxygen!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Course I am! This sort of place stinks!” He laughed as he definitely hadn’t told us on purpose.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTBhYmI3ZDRhMzQ3OTM5ZDM5NzY1N2NkNDQxYzIx"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYzljMzZjM2NiNzQzYWZhNjY0ZDI2ODhmMzkxYjkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ass!</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjM0NzNlMzAzNDQxZDQ4Y2Y2YzdkYzhhNGRhYjI0"> </p>
<p class="cnMzODBjYjcxYjMwMjQzZmM5NDQ4NTE1MGFlYzMxOTBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Old Collin, sure is a jerk!” I called out loudly enough he could hear and I saw the way his shoulders twitched.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWVlNjIzNGI1YzQ0Y2ViY2FjZjg2Y2EwYzUyZTVj"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NzExZDc3NGJiNDQwMmU4ODMyYjcxYTUxNDI1YWI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not old!” He snapped back and I nodded. Revenge successful.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjkzZmM5Mjk3YTQ3NjhiMGYzYWM4ZDRhMmRiYzU1"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZjNjZjgzNzAyNTRkZWY5ZjRkYTgxNWJhODRkZjFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">But first. I adjusted my jumpsuit, activating the integrated forcefield generator using the small control panel on the sleeve of my jumpsuit, and an invisible bubble stopped air from passing through around my head, despite not wearing a helmet. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWZkZDQ1YjFkYzQzZDNiYjU1MTk2ZDA4MTliMGEz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOGJhNmJmZDZkYzQ0MjRhYjMwOGM5NTNlOWFiMGQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The others did the same thing, and I watched as everyone breathed sighs of relief as the smell was processed out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmMyMjYzN2FiYjRkMjc5MDc5MjM1NjViMTZjZTc2"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZTEyODc4YTI1MTQxODM5MmQ5YWE1MDIzY2FhMzdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I fiddled with the small Tab control panel on my sleeve making sure it was on a low range just to keep the air ‘in’ and not much else. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGNkMTVmZDk1ODRlOGU4M2QxZmI5NGNiODAxNjAy"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YzJhMmMwN2FiMTQ2Njc5Y2QyNDA3NmZkYzU2Y2Q3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jumpsuits with emergency force fields were super useful and everyone on board UNK-L got one as a just in case measure.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzMxYTI1ZmM4NzQ0YzNhMTRhN2M1MjU3NjhiMTdk"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YzZkYWFlZjk5YTQ2NjRhMjM3MDhjMGVkZGY1ZDg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It had saved lives over the years.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzNmYmQ5MTEyYTQ4ZTA4NTNhODY3ZmNhZDE5NmE5"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NGFkMGVlYzBmZTRmOGQ5Zjk4MTg4YjNlNGFiYzhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Plus you could re-use the electronics pretty easily. It was just a Tiny Iris Drive, in a padded section, and a force field emitter, usually implanted around the jumpsuits collar. Connect it to a Tab in my case I had one sewn into my wrist as a just in case.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWE0NDBhNzA2OTQyYmU4MjY3MjYxMTk3YjMwNTg2"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZmYyNmY0ZGQ2NzRmMTZhOTg2OGNjN2M4ZTJmMzI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yep, definitely because I was worried about forgetting my Tab and not being able to adjust settings, and not because I had forgotten my Tab at home too many times and Mom had laid down the law.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmUyNTU0ZDA2YjQ3OTY4NGU5MjM1NmQzZDlhZDk5"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“There, everyone ready?” I called out, and got a few surprised looks as the other kids had been staring out the now opened ramp at the sight of the city beyond.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzMyYjE0MWJjOTRmMzk4ZTZjNGMxZjBmZTUxN2Nj"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNWFkYjYzYTU2YzQ0YTdiN2ZmODRiN2U2MTg1ZmI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">They hesitated so I rolled my eyes. I was about to walk out but I realized I was Crabbit-less. I walked over to one of the Crabbit that had gotten herself on her feet and was walking around weakly, and picked her up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2RiZWRlZjk5YjRmMWE4NTFmNTk2MmYxYzM5NjRi"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cling on.” I told her as I threw her over my shoulders, and with her little legs she clung on like a backpack. It wasn’t quite as comfortable as having them hovering on my shoulder, but it was fine.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGQ4YzhhMzc4MzQ3ZGNhNzc1Y2ZjMTNmMGEzOGE3"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZTFmMmMwMGMyNjQ3MTI5MzY2ZDBjZWJjNjYzODcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">And so I walked out, following after Old Collin that was waiting at the base of the ramp. The man sent me a dirty look as I approached, he then looked away, and then sent another one.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTRhMTYyZTY2OTQzYzBhNTNiYTFiOGFjZjEyMDU2"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMTVlYWY4ZmJkMTRlYzZhMzczYjM4MmM2ZjAyNjU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah he was still sensitive about his nickname.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmE4MTUwNWVhODQzMTRhYjkxNmQ5ZWIwMTY4ODUy"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZmQ3NDBkOGMwYjRiZDRiZTFkN2ZlNTIwNTEzYmNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s the Port office. You’ll need to speak with them, get the docking fees paid, and we can get our work done.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“How much is the fee?” I asked, because I hadn’t really thought about that! I mean sure I had Creds, but!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTEwYzg0OTM3MzQ0ZDVhZWVmYTQyNWM2YjY2MjFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Depends on the dock. Don’t worry about it this time. Marie’ll be clearing that. It’s on us. But you should still be there, get a feel for what it’s like if you want to keep flying this beast.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTVlZmM0MmY0ODQzYzZiOGU0YzhkYTg2OTNlYTU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks Collin.” I said surprised at how nice he was being. Collin was usually a massive jerk! </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTIwZjcyYTllMTRiODViYWFlZGJlOWI0YTAxNzMz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZDg3MGY2YzA1NjQ2NWZhY2I3ZjRlY2FlMjE3YzAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah yeah, brat.” He grumped at me, but while he still seemed to kind of hesitate I stepped forward off the ramp and then onto the large landing pad. We were pretty high up, on a massive building that was a starport, so it wasn’t like I was looking at grass, instead I was practically in the clouds, and in between the massive buildings that sort of made a funny bowl shape around the star port I could see far out in the endless distance more and more buildings spread out as far as I could see.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDk0ZjVjYzQ4ZDRiMThhOWY1ZDUxYjE2ZWQ4ZDhk"> </p>
<p class="cnM5N2MxZGI1MTBhYzQ0YWRiMGYyZGUzZjk3MjI3MTIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t head straight for the port authority office, instead I walked over to the edge of the landing pad and looked out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjFkNDQzNTM5MjQyNjU4MjIzMzhlMmMyZjNjYzlk"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Down at the base level streets there were thousands of tiny vehicles moving around, looking like rows of ants, then above that were the smaller ground buildings. None of them looked less than four stories, all of them belching white smoke into the sky. The smoke trails entwined into a misty cloud layer that was constantly being torn apart by the shuttles, or whatever the flying vehicles in this planet were called running through it. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDYzZWQ1ODA2MjQ2ODBiMjcwOGRhNmRhNGFhNjE2"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYTkxNzA0NTQyMzQ0MzM5OGY1OWJjZWU1ODE4ZjUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then the massive buildings broke up even that. Some of them looked residential, some might be industrial belching smoke, or even a mix. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2QzYWI0NmVmYzQ0NjI4OTRlYzhkNDdhZDczMWE0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZGQyMjU2ODMzMDQ4NjI5NzE5YjliMzllNTc5NDVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see far down a street was a terrace with plant life, real or fake, and people were eating at some sort of cafe hanging off the side of a building. Shuttles coming up and parking alongside to let their passengers off.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzU5MWE2ODlmYzQwM2ZiZjE0NzdlYzc2MzY3OWZh"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZWVjYTI3YTM3MDQ3NjY5OTA4MjljMWM1NTg5ZjZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">So many people.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2RhZmEwODlkYzQ2ODZhZjYyMzU3ZjZlODI0YWEy"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYjczODg0YjdhNDQ5ZmFhNDkzMjg1Mjc1NDkwM2Uy"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it wasn’t that, that had me entranced. A sci-fi city was something amazing, and I would have happily stared at it for a long time, but it was the song that entranced me. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjI2NWUxYzk0ZjRjZGM5M2E1ZTU2NmE4YzQ2ZmVk"> </p>
<p class="cnM2M2U1MDE4ODJmYjRhMmJhMGE5ZjJiNzQyNDg0Y2Ey"><span style="font-weight: 400">It sounded like a jungle beat, but made of industrial noises. Hammers hitting steel, the hiss of steam and smoke, and the rumble of engines.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTY1N2JjZDM5YzRhNjU4MzNkNzBiNzdiYWRkZGVk"> </p>
<p class="cnMyM2U0MTAxYjA3NzRhOWZiNzYwMWU0Njg1ZmM4MjZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a song utterly unique to any other I had heard. I’dheard the song change, but I hadn’t realized until that moment that different places would sound so different. UNK-L had its unique song, and I realized that it was utterly unlike any other place.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjUzNzgyMmY1ODQ1MWY5ZDRkYzI1M2YwYTJlZDk4"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYmExODM2ZWM1MzQ4MWZhOGFlODA5ZTc3NjZhMjAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kat?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?” I asked, turning my head but not tearing my eyes off the sight, as Carter had called me.</span></p><span class="cjE5NDJhOGM0MmYzODRhZTg5Yjc0NWYzMDE2ZTIzYTcw"><br/>Stolen story; please report.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjMjE2N2FkMzBlZDQ4MGZhNDA2YTcwNmU0ZDYyY2Zj"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah just enjoying the view, and the sound of it all.” I breathed in and out and shook it off. Turning to see the boy as he seemed almost wary of the edge leaning back like the edge was going to snatch him off. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzJkNDk1ZDI1NTRmMzhhYTYyZTQ2NmE4M2YyYWEz"> </p>
<p class="cnNiM2MxYjQ5NzQ2NTQ1MzA4OTkxMzY0N2RiYjQyYWJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You okay?” I asked back and he grimaced. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODRjNzlmMTMyODQ2ZGI5NGI3YjhlZjA5ZDcyYmRj"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MGQwOGIxM2U0ZDQ3NzQ5M2EwY2M4YmYwYWJhMWU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know what it is! It feels like something is pushing me! But the Gravity is weird!” He hissed and I realized what it was with a laugh.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmU3YjBlZjZhYTRlZDlhYTI3MDExY2NjMThkMzJh"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZmMwYTIwNDBiYTQ3MGU4MzNjY2I2MDdkMWVjZGY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s wind Carter.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn’t feel like wind!” he argued back looking like a startled cat.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it feels just like wind, you’re just used to the breeze of the oxygen units on UNK-L. Wind can get really strong on a planet. C’mon.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… How strong?” He asked in a whisper and I just laughed. Hopefully he’d never find out.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGFiZTYwZmE2NDQ1ZDM4ZDljMzYyYTIzZmE4OTM1"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYzcwNGIzYThhYjQ3MWRiMGJlZDljNWE5MzhiZTFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone was gathered up and the kids were looking around in shock. Old Collin was hiding it, but even he seemed a little uncomfortable on the planet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTc1ZmRkMjJiOTRhNmE4ZmNiMGY1NDNmNDRkNDBk"> </p>
<p class="cnNjM2ZjODI3ZGNiNTQzMmJhNDg4MDAzMTY1ZjY1MzNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh. I guess when you spend your entire life on a space station, a normal planet must be kinda strange.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjA4Mzk5Nzk4MTQ5YmY5ZGQ3MjczZWZhN2VlOTJh"> </p>
<p class="cnM3M2IzOGU4NTFiNzRlOWU4ZDRkM2M2MzhkOWFjNGYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was strange for me too. My body wasn’t used to the wind, or the way everyone just felt different with Gravity being so… Firm?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTk0ZTA4ODcyZjQzN2RhYTMzYzQ4MzkwZGIzOGUz"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNzcxMDUwMjc5MzQzMWFhYTRiNWFiYzQ3YTJmZjMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think I had ever really registered that gravity plates, for all their effectiveness, weren’t quite… Right.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmYxZTE3OWE1ZjRiNWRiM2YxMjRhY2E3NjM4MmNl"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZDM3OGU5YzRlYTQ4NWM4YmI1ZGU2ZDVmMDI5MGM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">But for station kids that was how gravity felt.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWIwY2EwM2JjMTRhMGY4ZDBkMmQ0ZWUwYTE3Zjg4"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNjU1ODhmZmUwZDQ2YWU4N2ZjYWI0OTk5YjhhY2Vi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked past them into the Port Authority building and looked around at the massive room that was like a ring around the building. Then there was a set of circle stairs that led to a large round desk where a person was sitting. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzBkNjM0ZTQ4ZDRhZDFiOGFkYWNmNDhhZDU5Mjgw"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMThlZmRkMmRhODQ0YTA4YTA1ZTJkMzcyOTA1ZTgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was actually already another… Captain? Ships crew? At the desk seemingly doing their paperwork.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTA0ZTJhMjE5ZTRjODQ4OGIwZjQ3YjI5NWVjMDM2"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYjYyMTliYzBjZDRiNjBhOWY1NGU5MWVhN2RmZjI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon.” I called out to the group behind me, as I walked to the stairs and took them carefully. My balance was a bit wonky as gravity was different. Striding across the room I reached the circular desk, and ended up just waiting at the spot that was marked for the Docking Pad we had landed at.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGJlN2JkMGY5MDQxNmJiNTQ4YzUyYjAyZDk2MWEx"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YzY0YjgyMjVhNDRkYjI5ZGU0M2Q0MWY3MzYwZDFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was only one woman manning the desk so I just started waiting. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTcyYTgyYjM4MDRiNGZiMDFhZjRmMmMyOWU5ODYy"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do we do?” Marshall asked, looking around as he joined me at the counter and seemingly getting annoyed at the wait.</span></p>

<p class="cnM2NTE4MTQyYjRmNDQwNjVhMTQxNDA4Y2UwYTY1YzQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally a few minutes later the woman pushed a button and her chair actually shot across the inner ring of the large round desk until she slowed and stopped in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4MGNlZDA3NGY4ZDQyYTdhOWJmYWEwZWI3ZDk0OTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome to Elinai! Can I have your Ships transponder information please!” She greeted and I nodded grabbing my Tab and a moment later she had what she wanted and nodded. “Phantom Star, registered! Welcome to your first visit to Elinai! Docking Fees are listed here, and all payments must be made before liftoff.” She warned and I nodded at her rapid fire explanation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWRkZTM1YmIzOTQyYjRhZWIzNWFhOTY1ZTM2Y2Ji"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OWFiM2ZmZGVjYzRmNjJiMTM5OTI5NDc0NTFiMTRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me see!” Marie called out as she walked up and looked at my Tab with the fees.</span></p>

<p class="cnM0M2Y3NmJjYjg5NDQzZTRhY2NkMWVlZGEzNGQ3NGI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, her own Tab was out and she made a few rapid fire presses and tapped my Tab with her own.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhZTQ4MDViYjM0NDQ0ZTE4MzBjMjA3NDc4NWExOTg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for your payment! You have 21 standard hours before additional fees! Do you have any questions?” She asked, and I just shook my head, because most of it was all on my tab, the fees, and what caused them and everything else. I’d have to look it over later. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTlmOWQ4MGVhZDRhZjA4ZWNjMTcyNTMzM2JlYjI0"> </p>

There is a comm number if you need assistance, if you find yourself unable to reach your ship and renew your fee, please contact us through that number before your time is up! The elevator to the bottom floor is right there, and if you hit floor six, you’ll find the ride service area!” And that was that. Much faster than the time she had taken with the other group.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1ZmYwYWE0OWZlMzRlMDZhZTY1Zjg5OWZiMDQ0MGE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">We all stepped into the elevator which didn’t feel much different than the ones on earth. No fancy tech or anything. </span></p>

I felt the tingling in my belly as we dropped,, but couldn’t tell how quick, but it was causing the others a lot of trouble.</span></p>

The shipment was in a large shipping container. Carter and Collin broke the seal on it once we were brought to it, and we all checked everything to make sure it was what we had ordered.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxMGU4MDQwMGI2OTQ1OGU4YzBjZTk4ZTZjNzIwYWMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was too large to throw into the trunk of a shuttle of course, so the Solar Storage guy set up a large transport to move the unit, and we went along with it.

<p class="cnM2Y2Y2ZTA2MDViYzQzOThhNGY4ZmMxMzMxMmUyMzA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">So we landed back on the pad where the Phantom Star was located, and I relaxed as no one had come by according to the Crabbit that were walking stiffly around the hold.</span></p>

The hovering forklift vehicle that had pulled the storage unit off the transport and then floated it into the hold had set it into place. The boys had finished locking it down with a mixture of Gravity Panels, and actual locking components.</span></p>

I wonder how much trouble they’ll get into?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hopefully not too much.” Collin offered. “Now I’m coming with you two, neither of you are armed.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, You're armed?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzM1OTVmNzU5OTQzZGE5OWIzMjBlODZmZjU0MDI4"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.” Collin answered back, shooting me a look like I was an idiot.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzlmZGRhNjliYTRjZmJiZDBlMzBiNWZkMzUxYWEy"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZjM0YThjOTJmNzQ3NTU5ZWMyOWE1MDFhZDMxYWE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does that mean Carter is armed?” I asked, and got a smirk from Collin, but not an answer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTdlOTNmZjFhZTQ4NTBiMmYwYmZlYjliZTU5OTAw"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOTg5ZDU3ZjQ4MDRjMmVhZGQ4Y2RmYmI3ZDY2YzZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh. I guess as the leader of the group he would have been given a blaster or something. I hadn’t noticed it though… Wait, the Crabbit should have. And they should have told me!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTI0ZDU4MDQ5NzQyOTBhNDkyZjVmZDE2ZDFiZWRj"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZjRiMTRlNDY0YjQ3YzBhZDUzMDg4Mjg1YWNmODc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d have to add that to their programming to inform me if anyone guest or not got on the ship armed. What was the point of having Type 4 sensors, if I wasn’t being told what they found?</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNiYzk5MDY2YzJkYjQ5NWQ5YTcyYjI0NjBkMzBmYmNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Marie, Collin, and I found another shuttle. This time demanding a more reasonable ride from the driver, a woman chewing some sort of… Stick? It made me think it was some sort of drug or something, but Collin didn’t make any motion to choose another shuttle, and then we were off.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTliNTg2YWM5MzRlOTViOWU2MmFhYjlhZmNjYWRk"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZGJkODNmOTI2MjRjZDZhZTY3YjJlZTRkMWZhNGRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">We didn’t end up going far, just across the gap from the Star Port and right up to a large tower that I could have seen from the Landing Dock.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjg1NWY0NWZjNDQxYzhiZjdiMTFkMDYxYmRmZjk1"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YTM1YzQ4NGI4MDQ1NTQ4NDRkNWQ0NTc4YjlkZjY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the best shopping center in the area. Caters to off-worlders.” The driver said, as we pulled up. Then to my surprise she hesitated in holding out her Tab to get payment from Marie. “They also have a tendency to raise prices. So be cautious.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Marie nodded and to my eyes flicked a few extra Creds into the woman's account, as all three of us stepped away from the shuttle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDlmNDg5MmEwYjRkNDlhNGQwNjliYzc5MjA2OGE5"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZTYzN2JmMTllZTRjZTZiY2NkZGZhMjExYTQxZmUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good advice, but something I would have told you as well.” Collin rumbled out in a deadpan.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzcyNTU2ZjA5NTQyNmRhMWNiNmM3N2Q3YzZlZmY3"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, but she did offer us the information.” Marie said and I nodded. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDRkMDliY2Q5NTRjMzhiMzIxNGZiOWI3MmU4YmIw"> </p>
<p class="cnMyN2VlZmZhMTVmMTRiODY4MWMzY2U4NjVlMzQ1NzNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She could have just kept quiet. The warning is worth a bit of a reward. I think.” I added and turned towards the large glass doors that led from the shuttle drop off into the building. Interestingly, it had a sort of air lock. As we approached the outer doors opened. Instantly we were attacked by air conditioning. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWNkYThiMWM0YTRkZjE5OWY4MGFmNTNhM2JmODM1"> </p>
<p class="cnNkM2M5NjU0ZWM0NzRjMTg4Yzk1YTdjMTQ4NmU1YzNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t until the inner doors opened that I realized it was a pressure room. To keep the air from outside out. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjVmZDE1YzQyNTQwNDFiMWU4YjVhOTM5ZjE3YWYz"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NzY4YWU1MDg0OTQyMzBiMmVkYmIzZDhlODBlNDhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I suppose even the people that lived on the planet didn’t like the smell.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTIxNWYyOTJkMTQzN2ZiYjUyOTljZjY0ZWU3ZGY2"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZGE0ODc0NGNmZDRhOWZhY2Y2NDlmNzg3ODdkZWEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that I could be entirely sure since my forcefield kept me safe. The inside of the building was a giant mall of sorts. It had a very industrial feel. Many of the sections were shadowed from old lights failing, and massive fans spun slowly along the wall for some reason. Even with the song in my ear I wasn’t sure why they needed to be so huge. But it caused the light that came in through the glass walls to flicker and turn.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjNmNWQ1ZWQ4NzQ2OTFiMTNhYWMwZTllYzdiNDgw"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YzY4NjU1NWRmNzQyZWJhZTM3YTdhN2IxOTJhYjE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">But while I was looking over the technology of the building and trying to figure out why things had been built that way Marie had noticed the people.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWU5MWYwZGU1MzRhY2I4NzZmOGMyNDUyOTMzYzdi"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NWJmNGVkNGY2NjQ1NzdhMDUyNmI2NTJkYjA4MDBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is she wearing?” Marie asked quickly in a whisper, but the voice was shocked. I looked over and blinked and felt like I needed to cover my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2E1ZWVjNThjYzQ0Mjg5YzNlMTg1NzA0YTdkMzc2"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZTU1ZDgzOWRjYjQwYzc4ZGNjZTNhNjQ2N2NkZDVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t know.” Collin offered, but as I looked over I realized he wasn’t tearing his eyes away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWUxNTIwZTBmMzRlYWI5NTAxMTQ2N2ZiNWJkNTMz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkODY1YTNiOGU1YzQ5MWE5YzlmMWQ0NWI5NzRhNjkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Collin!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shush girl. For once I’m not on station. I’m not related to anyone here. Don’t blame me for looking.” He grumbled and I flushed a bit at the tone and interest in his voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjVmOGQ3MGFlMzQ0N2I4NmIyY2M1MDRlMzlkOWY2"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZjYwMzY2MGNmZjRkODZhMWJmNzJjYjA1MDM5YmJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s naked!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Almost.” He agreed and Marie looked a little grossed out. I looked back at the woman that had so shocked Marie, and tried to figure out if that was some sort of forcefield, or just… Oh, no it was some body paint… </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjZjODY5YjU5ZjRmYTRhMzEzZTNiZTRmMWQxOWNk"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMzBhNmNjY2ZlZDRjZTRhMzg1ZmQyNjhjMzk0OGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yikes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmMxYjc1NGRkNjQ4OTM5Y2ExM2UzNDg4NDFkY2Ri"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YzQzMmVmMTg3NjRmYWU4MDE3NGY2YWI0YzI4ZDQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not brave enough to walk around literally wearing nothing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon.” I pulled Marie forward looking away from the woman that had been sitting on the side of a building, and… I’m pretty sure she was a lady of the night to be honest. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTA4MDM3YTQwNzQ1Y2ViYjE5OGFkYmI4ZDk0OTc2"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZWJjMjAwYWI1ZTQxOTRhM2Y0MjlmNzI1MzA0MWZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I suppose that sort of thing was accepted here? Or maybe it was just because this was a shopping area for offworlders. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTE2OTUyZTQ1ODRjMDc5YWU0OTRkNmFhMzgxNDQ4"> </p>
<p class="cnMzN2ViMWIxYjE3MTQ5MmViNTU3MzM0ZjQ3ZmJhNTBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Offworlders were usually rich, or men that worked hauling between worlds or systems. Which would still make them rich, because you don’t hire someone desperate for Cred to control a Starship no matter how humble.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWQ3MTc5MDAwMjRjZmM4OGNhZGQzM2I0ZmEyYjdl"> </p>
<p class="cnMzM2Y0OTBlZGZmODRhZmFhNGFmYjQ2MzFlMTIwZTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">We moved on, but it wasn’t the only shocking outfit that had Marie grabbing my arm to point them out in scandalous outrage.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDE2MWI0NWU1NjRmNGFhYmFjZWUyMjBmMDZjOWU0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1Y2NkY2FmZjEyODRlZmU4MmZhNzMwODI5ZDMwMmJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I just did my best not to look, instead keeping an eye on the shops and looking for things I actually needed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmVmN2IzNDY5YjRiM2U5ZjNmNmQ4NjMxNjFmZjdm"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOTEzNzk4NjBhNDQ2ZDA5NWE4MDhhMzhhMTVmZWM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">There had to be a place where I could buy a cold storage unit for the Phantom. And maybe some better fixtures for my Captains Room? A larger Tab Screen could be cool, like a big screen TV?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTU1YzhhNzNhMDQxYTU5NTJhZWVmMTI0YWEwYTgz"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNWQ0ZDA1NTE2NTRiMzI5MDg3Zjk5YzMwOGIzNzNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Or a Captains Chair?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDk4ZGI0NmU3OTRiZGQ5ZTRlYWNjMmU4NzJkMGU5"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZmQ3NThjOGM2YjRlYzViNmZjYWEyOWQ1MGYzOTY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Our exploration was stopped by Marie before I could start looking as she gasped and hurried away forcing Collin and I to follow. Even if Collin cursed under his breath at Marie’s sudden rush.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDFkZWI5ZjcwYjRkZjlhZjUzYjgxOTMxMTdiZWNi"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YmM1MGEyYTkzZjQ2ZjBiZTY2NjQ2NWM3YzFmNzFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The thumping bass was what told me where we were going. The shop had a dark entrance, but light was flashing inside, and as we chased Marie inside, the place had some light machines spinning around and making the whole place sort of ethereal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWJmNDYyNzc4YTQ4MzBiODIzNGZiZDQxYzA0NDVi"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMTcyMGU1NTNjYTQ2YWI4NzQ4ZTZhZmYzYmYxNmZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a music shop, and Marie was already looking through what I thought at first was some sort of hard copy. Like a CD or something.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWU4YmYyMzhjZDQwZWZiYmY0NzY3MmExYzFjMGQ0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNzFhMTM3YzRiMzQ3YzNhNmM1OWEzZTdlOGZhZmY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn’t really seen anything like that in this life, everyone just used their Tab for shows or music, but then I realized they weren’t hard copies, just plastic shells with images displaying the music, and from the looks of it, little speakers to test the music, with links to download locations.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmE4NjAxM2RiODQ2ZjY4YjMzNjc3MTg2OTUwZmZi"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNzc5OTQyYjRmOTQ0ZDNiM2ZmNDRjYjUxNzlkMDIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve been trying to get this album forever!” Marie said when we joined her as she spun and flashed… Yeah I wasn’t listening to that. “What?” She demanded at my look,</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTdlNDJhY2NkOTQxYmZiNzBhOTQ5YmY5NGI1MjZj"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MDU0MDk2NjIxYzQ2NTNhZTQzOGIwZWM3YzFhN2Qy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eon Fleet is the best band in the entire Galaxy!” She snapped at me, and I just very pointedly looked away from the five young men that were on the cover of the download chip, and very pointedly kept my opinion on boy bands off my face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzE5ZGVjZDRjZjRkZGQ4YzgzZTlkYjRiZGU3NTZm"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNTRmMGNlMjA1ODRhMGFiYmYyZDg0YmU3MWY4YWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get it if you want or don’t. But hurry it up.” Collin demanded, and Marie looked like she wanted to argue, but instead turned and started searching.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTBmZWM0YzMzZTRmNzY4YmNkYTgzMTcxZWYwZmMx"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZjllYzMzNzk2NTQzMTliNWViOTFjMDkxZWJhZjlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Collin and I shared a look and just shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTJhZmY1ZDBjNjQ5ZTViOTY4NGI1N2Q2MzUxZDU1"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNGU0NWY1NzRjZDQ3ZGU4MGI1ZDk1MzM0M2Y5MmM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjkzZTM3YmFhYzQxODQ4MTY3MjNiZjExZjgxNTMz"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YTFlMzBjNmE3OTQ0MjFiM2I1ZDdlNDA5YmUzMTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was stuck people watching. We stopped at a clothes store oddly enough, for Collin. Apparently, he was looking for some gloves as his work gloves were going bad, and he hated the standard ones that we had stocked up on the station.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGJmMWEyMDQxZTQ1M2Q5MGNjMmJmYWEzNjdjYzJi"> </p>
<p class="cnMyODVhNmY3M2Y0MTRhOGRhODYyZjJmOTJmMjI1Zjdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I used them though, and didn’t know why he hated them. I looked down at the mostly white gloves I still wore. They were actually super stain resistant, so the color didn’t get smudged up too much until the gloves ended up really worn, but they were safety equipment, and you shouldn’t wear them out that long anyways.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDlhNDE3MDIzZjQxYmJiZDMzZDlhZDE1NmYxNTg4"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZDAwMDczZDFiYjRiYjNhOWIwNWUwNDQwMTgxZjAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">But I looked up to watch more of the people walk by.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzMxMTVlOTk5YzRmZmFhMzVlYTUxNjgzMTdiZWY3"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NThmNTE0MGQ4ZDQ0ZDliNWIwMzdiYzdjZjZkNzRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of them were locals despite the shopping area being meant for the Star Port.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjlkODgwNTYyNzRjYzg5N2NkMGRlNzNmYjkwZjg4"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NmFmYjcyMDFhZTQzYzQ5MTQ1ZjY0ZmI5MTE3Mjlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">And almost everyone had a mask of some kind over their face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzhkN2FlM2U2MjQ5MDJhMTZjMGQyYzg3NjgyNjI1"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YjllNDc2NWY4OTQ1ZGFhYTc5OGRiNmVjMWM0M2Iw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Either a sort of cloth mask that reminded me of cheap cloth masks, or actual respirators. Most of them had taken them off inside, and looked relieved to breath in fresh air, but it told me a lot about just how toxic the air on Elinai was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGY5ZjkzOGI3ZjQ2ZTZiMjA4YmZiMmQ3MzAyOTVi"> </p>
<p class="cnNiODQzZDFiNGMwOTQ2MDJiMjYyNDI0Yzk5ZjEzYmVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think I’d risk taking a breath myself even inside, I still remember how bad it smelled. Luckily the Phantom Star had an oxygen refresher I had found in an old wreck, and those things were designed to be fixable with spit and a stick, so it was functioning perfectly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDNlMGMyM2E2MTQxMzZhYjhkYzE5MjU4MjEzMmFl"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NDdhNDA0OTE3YTRkZTg4OWM1ZWYyNDVmMzFjZTIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d do a double refresh just in case though.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDEzNjgyNDQ2MTRhMzBhODk1M2M3OTBmZWI2Zjky"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYjg2MjIyZGQ4ODRlNzY4Y2EzNjViMjMzNWM1NDY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it.” Collin called out, looking pleased as he walked out with a new pair of gloves in his hands…</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjI0YzQyZWRjZjRlZDY4MmE1ZjczZmI2NWE1N2Rk"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNzQ5N2E1MmMxYTQ5MTViMzg4YWY0ZjBhNzc2YTUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re blue.” I commented and Marie looked down at them confused too.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDE2MTc2NDA1YTQ0ZmQ5MWVmYzI0ZGZiMjZlOGM0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxODg3YTFlZTFlNTQzOTE5YTMwNTcxN2UyOTFiMjU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep.” He said happily. I looked from my gloves to the ones he had.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjNjNDBiZGM5MzRkN2JiMzMxOWFkZmRiYzc1YmFk"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZDVhZTcwMDk2ZjRmYzVhNGQyZDRlNWJhMjFjZTVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The exact same.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjViM2M4MWU0ZTQwNzhhNzIxMjJkMDljNjI0MzRj"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNThkZGZmOTY4YjQ3YmRhNWU0ZjA3Yzg2MmViMTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s the same gloves.” I pointed out, and he scoffed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODU5NGUzY2NhZDRhYjdiOGJkMWQxOGI4MmYwNGM5"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNGI1NWI3MTE4ZDQ3YWZhNTYzN2UzMDkzMjc1ZWYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, these ones are blue. Damn loggies ordered an entire shipment of white gear. Used to be blue when I was a kid, I like them.” He said and I just looked to Marie who was pouting.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjkwYzY3NGY5ZTQ1NGM5YmQzOWMwY2YwM2I0MjYx"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYWFlNDg3NjJlYjQ1Mjc5NzM0YTEzZTNlNTBkZGIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If logistics needed to change the color it was for a reason!” She snapped, but Collin wasn’t having it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmZmMzQzNTUyMDQxMTJiODBiNzg5YTQ4M2JmMDEx"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYjg0Y2ZjNTQ3YTQ5MDZhNjVhZjEzMmE1MDAzY2E2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Girl I know exactly why they changed it up, and it’s as stupid as you’d think. Shut up.” He snapped back, and Marie flinched and looked away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMThlMWYyZjRmYTQ5YTliMmRhZmQwYzY4MjU4Njg5"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYzZiZWJmMGU0NjQzMGZiOGRlNzllN2Q0ZWUxNWIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay okay, calm down.” I demanded, looking at the two supposed adults. No, I wasn’t dealing with this. This time I purposefully set off. While waiting I had the bright idea of checking for a map, and my Tab had easily found a digital copy of the shopping center.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWNhNTc5MzFmMTQ4ODRhOWFlN2RkNjhjMDI0Mzk1"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYmYwMzU4ZDJmYTQxODdiNzFhMmEwNjFhYmNkMTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Traveling through the crowds I found one of the brightest shops in the entire place as my destination. Marie, and Collin followed after me as I charged towards my own goal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTQ3M2M2NDRjZjQxMTNiOTM0MDA4NWJhNmRmYzVm"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MjhjMzZhOGEyYjQ4MGQ5ZDM3MDdlMGVmMDVlOTJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Slow down Little Kat, you and your long legs!” Marie grumbled as she nearly had to jog to keep up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWQyYmQ5OTkwNDQyYWU5NzY5Y2MxOTRmMjM1MzY4"> </p>
<p class="cnNiN2Y0OTUwMTJkNzQ3OWQ5NzI2NzdlZGIwMDMwMTAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine, we’re here anyways.” I called back, barely looking at her as we entered… Well a pretty normal appliance store. With slick shiny tiles, things were brightly lit, and painted white.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDI1YzU4Y2JhOTRjNDY4YTk4MGQzNzk3OTAwNzJh"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYjZmZGYwMGVkYjQ1NWQ5ZGFkYmI4MzJkNGNmZWY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh this is nice.” Marie offered and I nodded, before nearly instantly we were attacked!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome to Calvin’s Appliance and Materials! How can I help you today?” A man asked, and for the first time there was no mask in sight, instead he was well dressed in an odd, sort of suit that was three colors, with a strange pattern to it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjZlM2I1OWZlODQxMGRhZTUxNTRiZWQ0YzVjYjYz"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMWExMDNjNGE5YzQ5ZWE5OTg0ZTYxOTc0Zjg1YTk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm, I’m looking for some mess supplies for my ship.” I said, and I could see the man's eyes widen, even as his smile never shifted from its bright grin.</span></p>

Does it have any power feeds for integrated force fields, and the data wiring, what’s the bandwidth?” I streamed out questions and instantly the seller looked a little lost, but the woman kept her smile as she pulled up the Tab on her wrist. </span></p>

So hopefully it’ll teach you a lesson.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWYxNDk2NDdjZTRjMDg4YmExOTI3M2M2Nzc4YmQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">We landed without much else going on, both boys nursing their wounds and as we came out onto the docking pad Marshall didn’t just turn around and take off, but just slumped towards the Phantom Star and climbed up the ramp.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwNTllMGJjZmFjNTQ3ZmJiZTNjNjIyOWNmNTlmNzk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right.” I muttered and turned away, looking towards the stack of goods we had been loading up when we got the call from the boys. </span></p>

<p class="cnNiNjMzOWVmMDRhMzQ4ODViMTU2ODMyNGQ1MDc4ODhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">For one, everything was super heavy in atmosphere, and the Crabbit weren’t much help like normal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjI4YTEzN2I1ZDQ2MWM4MjU5OWY0NzdmZmVkZjM2"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZmI0Y2FkYzVkNTQ3MDY5OTVmYWU2ZDY3OTA3YzQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">That would have to be a later thing. Instead we all had a decision to make.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2JiYWNiYjIzYTRjMDM5NGYyZmU2NjBjZDFmYmIx"> </p>
<p class="cnMzOGI1YjY2ZTNkYjQwOTJiYzAwZTE5NjZlM2FjNGE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I had a decision, but I was trying to make others decide it for me. I turned away from where everything was finally stored away in the hold to look at my guests.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODk2MDYyM2I5ZjQxMzg4MGMyMmVlYWYzYzBhYjFi"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NjYyYTkzNTA0MzQwNjJiM2YwNWFiYjgxNjQ3YTYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do we leave now, or spend the rest of the time looking around?” I asked the group and everyone looked to Carter, then to me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDQyMDIxNmMyMDQxZWI4MWZmYmZjZWI0OWY3MmFm"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYjVkZGI3NDFkZDRmMTg5NWUwMDg2ZmFmNjk0OGM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Carter continued looking at me. </span></p>

<p class="cnM3ODA5NTI2NDk3MDQ0ZTI4MGJiMDQ2ZDViZjdmNDVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s up to you Captain.” Carter said firmly, and I wanted to curse. Foiled again by responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmMxMDkxMzEyMTQ4ODM5N2IyNTcxMDcyODFjMjdk"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMDJlYmU3YmY4NjQ4NDliZjNjZmIzYjdkYTY3NjY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay let me rephrase.” I grumbled, because Carter was being a shit on purpose. “We picked up our main goal, and we had some shopping time. Does anyone have anything else they want to pick up before we leave?” I had a few things I wouldn’t mind trying to find, but when everyone just shook their head, I slumped.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzA3ODBjYmE1MzQzZThhMTNjNzViZWNlNjI5OGE0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OTE0ZTM1OTYxNTQ2NWRiMmYxMmM2OWNjYmQ4NGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Decision time then.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmI1ODkzMmVmOTQzMGU4ZTMwNDEzZTc4OGViOTYy"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMGZjMzhjOGY3YzRiMWU4YWIwZTI2YmZhNDgyNmY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay we’re heading out early. Let's do a double check that everything is secured before lift off, it’ll probably be a bit rocky.” I said because it was worth mentioning. Everyone would be down here in the hold with all of our new stuff.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDQyY2QyMGZiMTQ0YWRiZTU0MjFhNWNlNDc5OTI2"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZDE5M2NjNDhiMDRkNmZiZjMxZDZkZmY1NjgzNzg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t want someone to get smooshed.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlN2M4YzMzZTQ2MzQ2MzliZWM0OWM3ZTlhNDFkYmM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes yes!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Check check!” My Crabbit chattered, as they started skittering around to the large cargo container and my smaller purchases that were in smaller packaging. They weren’t really doing much other than checking the systems that held cargo in place were working. They couldn’t exactly climb all over things with Gravity holding them down.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjhmZGIxNGFjMzQ2ZGY5NjY3ZTQ3NWZlYjZlNGVh"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MzVhN2M0MjQ1YzQyYTE5MzIxMTgwZGE1YzYyMjll"><span style="font-weight: 400">They had gotten pretty good at moving around though. Each of them was skittering around on their little rubber ended legs without too much issue.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWQwZGNhZDEzODQ3NDBiMzc1NWRlOTZkMjQ2ZTM1"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOTU0MGJhMWZjYzRhYzhhZDEwNTA4ZDBjYTE2Nzkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Why were they walking sideways so much though?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjFlYjk4ZGIyNjQ4ZWRiOTczYzAyNzY5YTJmMmI3"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYTE1YWNkZDcxMjQ0OWI5ODBhY2MyZDQ1NGFmZGE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll double check it.” Collin said suddenly looking not quite confident in the Crabbit.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDZhNGU1YWNiODQxODRhYzEzOTQ4MGVlNTFiZjhh"> </p>

Each cushion was two parts. The connector to the arm, and the actual pad. The pad was connected only with some light cushion fabric. But instead the end of each arm was a Gravity panel, meaning each cushion was always fluffed and floating a bit off the metal arm.</span></p>

And pushed a button. I could hear the water start filling it, and so I took a moment to straighten my hair up and throw it back into the bun. A few light stretches to air out my tanktop and retighten the arms of my jumpsuit around my waist.</span></p>

Clearing the path, they all threw a signal towards the large window up above where the controls for the entire cargo bay were held, and suddenly the container shifted, lifting off a few inches from the ground and then slowly drifting down a path laid out for it.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyNmFmZDk5MDI1ZDRlMjFiNmE0YzRkM2ZhOTFkN2Nl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m glad.” Uncle Kyle said with a smile that made me relax. “It’s not often we have anyone leave the station, and… I think only once before did one of our family have a ship they owned, but they rarely came back home once they had all the galaxy opened up for them.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Phantom Star is my home.” I said a little bluntly. “But home isn’t just a place, and my family is still here.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle Kyle smiled, seemingly pleased as he nodded. “I am pleased to hear that. Right now everything is calm thanks to your most recent supply run. Even the Octavius is no longer in system.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I noticed that… Is the Baron gone?” I asked, almost hopeful.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not for good. His ship is back to fighting shape, and it seems he’s quite displeased by the attack. It seems he’s looking to hunt pirates for a time to make sure they don’t think about coming into our system again… He left a message for you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I nearly flinched at that. “Do I want to know?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing so terrible, and just a verbal message. He wanted you to know that if you wanted to earn more creds he would be willing to hire you as a secondary vessel for his fleet while he hunts.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I stilled at the offer, because it was frankly a pretty good deal. He wasn’t hiring me per kill, but to assist his own ship… I shook my head though.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWIwMDdjYTc1ODQzMjdiYzgzYjU5MDQ0NzdiZjhk"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t. Things have finally calmed down, and I have a lot of work to do, to finish the Phantom Star. I’m going to fly her over to the Hangar right after this. I won’t be leaving for months, at least.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That long?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Two additional engines, the wings of the ship, and any additional weapon systems… The only reason I might leave is to go pick up parts that you can’t supply.” I explained rattling off the items on my gloved fingers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. Well the Baron was clear that you had access to the military supply lines. You shouldn’t have too many issues.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmRiOTgxNjlhYjQ4MDdhMjZlOGViMjIyMTgyMTBi"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMjY2MmIyZjRlZjQyNmE5MTBlNTg5MDM2OTQyZDI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded. Technically I had already ordered some things, but they hadn’t arrived yet. Things were still busy with the war after all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjlkNjdjMWU4NjQwNzM5OTI3MzQ3OWVhNzRlZDY1"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMTgzYTNiMzdiZjQ0MDE4OTM2NTdlZTg0MTdkYjMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">But the wait wasn’t a problem. Just putting the rest of the ship together was going to be its own massive chore…</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjgxNjU4Y2JmNTQ5YzJiNTMyOWYwMGNhYTM0NTY5"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYTliY2E2MTcwYjRkMTViMDA2OGExOWQxMWNkMjkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">And upgrading the Engine room so that the upgraded Diamond Drive doesn’t send off enough of a sensor signal that everyone and anyone knew that I was doing something weird.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2ZiNmY5MTgzYzRlMGNiYmJmYzlkZmY4MzhiNTY2"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNzhkYjQ0NWEzZjQ2ZWU5ODlhYTE0N2QyOTA5MGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">More work.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDIwYmM1ZWU0ZjRkOTdhMTAzMjQ4NTNjOTdjZmM0"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZDkxZmNlYWIyYzQ4NTdhODUxN2U5YWMxNzZiMGMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a smile split my lips regardless.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGE0ZTA3YmVkZjQzNmM4Y2QyNDkwYzdjNWY4M2I1"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YzhmNDIyODM4OTQ4NTlhNmZmNTRiYTM0ZmE1MmM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I kinda liked it.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyM2E2NjIyNzhjOTQwZmY5NjhlZjY4MWQ4NmE0NmFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was something so integral, something so human, about the awe I felt when I took the step onto an asteroid that no human had ever visited before. A place nothing human had ever reached.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTgwNDFiNjhiMjQ3NDY4Nzg5YTk4M2RmOWZiYzcz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNWU0OGU1ZDNmMTQwYThhMzA2NzQ5MTA4ODE4NzNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One small step.” I repeated the famous line as I landed softly on the dusty rock. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDRmYWI0NTBiMDRlM2M5YzZiMDg4MGEyY2MwYzhj"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YmYwMGEwMzYzNTRhYmViN2VkMjUzMzE2MGYzZTIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah? But it was a big step Captain! You went. Wooooo, all the way from the ship!” I blinked at the comments of my shoulder Crabbit doing my best not to break into giggles at her innocent comment.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGMxNjQ2ZGU3ZDRhMmE4NTFkNTY1ZTk2YjllYWU2"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MDNhMWMyNGYwYTQyMDM4MWFhZDhiMDM1MjY0ZWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a line from a famous astronaut. The first man to ever set foot on a moon.” I told her as I looked over my shoulder as she hovered there. She brought up her claw to just under her eye screen and tapped herself a few times like tapping at her lip.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTc2MDg5YTE5ZjRkYjM5NDNmNmQ4M2NhNzUwYjM1"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDk2Mjc0YjdjNTRjNGRiMjRmZTBkOGFmMGU4MTA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I still don’t think it makes sense? It was a big step.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDBhMDc1MjY5ODRlZDc4YjFmYzcyZmEwNDIwYjhl"> </p>
<p class="cnNhOWJiMDZiMWVjYTQ3ZGFiMzgzNWYzOTdmZDM3YzE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re a cutie.” I told her and she wiggled a bit at my words.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2FlNTdiYWFmMjQxM2E5ZjJlNDZlMmUwNjAyMmU0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYmU4YmU0YThkMzRlZDZhNzg1NzhhYmU4ODhjZGI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whaa! Oh you think so?” She asked both arms up to her ‘face’ and wiggled around in space.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGQ2YmEwZmU3YTQwZWI5NzYwYjA0OTc4ZmIzZDhj"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZjY2ODU4MTA1NDQzMjU5MzFmM2VlYTllNWJhYTE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I made you that way after all.” I said and poked her view screen which had her rolling backwards a few times before she regained her gravity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWJhMDQ3ZGM3ZDRkMDQ5ZTZiMDFkYTMzZTQ3ODFl"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNmY4YWE3YjQ3NzQ1OTlhMTY4YzMxNzIzNWE0ZTg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2I1N2MxZTQzMDQ4Nzg5NzE5ZWM1MDkzOTgwZmE3"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let’s start mining. It’s going to take forever to refine all of this.” I added looking over at the rocks. This was the asteroid with the sensor dampener meta material.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NThiYWY3ZTg2YTQ0OGZhZTViNGIwOTliYTUxMDdj"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNmIzZTQ4NDEyNjQzNzM4ZmYzMjQ0ZWRmOWRlYjk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The material I really wanted to add to my ships engine room to hopefully hide more of the Light Diamond Drives sensor profile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWUzZDdhMzFlNTQ4OTJiYjNkZDIyMTJlZjEwMmVj"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNTZiMmVlYzQ4ODQ2NWY4OTA5MjdkYjZmNjkwMDBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I could get away pretending I had a medium drive. Maybe I could eventually reveal I had a heavy once I was off doing some jobs and earning enough Creds I could feasibly pretend. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODUxMjA5NmJkNjQxZDU4ODYzNjMzNjVkMTVmMzg2"> </p>
<p class="cnNjN2U0Y2Y4NTEzMzQyZGM4YThlZGFjNjJhYzdhNzU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">But if I was going to finish the Phantom Star I needed the larger drive, and I needed a way to hide it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGZhYzI5NDZjYzQwMTI4NDJmNmYwNjExMGM2ZmJi"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNGE2ZjdiZmU0ODRmYTRhOTZkYzlkNmE5MjE0MWVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d even sat down in the engine room, and basically communed with the song trying to find the best way to hide the Diamond Drive, but unless I wanted to spend a long time trying to make another new crazy component that could maybe cause some serious sensor disruptions. I should just focus on the normal stuff.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDlmNzE4NWE4OTRlZjdhNDlhOGM0YzMyODUxZGU5"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNmI4ZWVhMDY3YzRlYWZhODlmNjNiNGQxYzBlOGY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I just didn’t think turning off the sensors of an entire system all at once was a good idea to even contemplate making. There was acceptable tech, and tech that would have everyone set out to kill or kidnap me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTA4NzU1YjhkNjRiMWViMjY4MWRjYTUxM2JkODVl"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZTVhMTQ1ZTcxYzQwMzQ5ZmQ2YzE3NjkzMjY3MDcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Like the Diamond Drive itself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzQ3NTc5NmZjZTQ4MWI4OGNmODVmYTViNTc3ZjZi"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYzAyMDc3YjliNjQ4NzRiM2IyMWVjZGU0NWFkNzIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">So I was out here on an asteroid with some mining equipment… Well it was mostly a few drills and the Crabbit, and I was going to try and gather up some of the meta material, and then make the forging facilities I needed to manufacture some dampener plates made out of it for my engine room.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTg4ZTJjM2Q3MDRjZmJiMzFhNTI5MmJhYWMzNzBm"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNzIzM2RhOGU1MzRiOTY5Y2Q0YTA3YjVlOTU5YTI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed, which was an interesting feeling when you were just standing around on an asteroid. But that’s all I was doing, standing around. I started walking the short way to the damn magic space rocks. Time to get to work.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTg1YzhiNDU4NjQ3MmJiMDJiNzIxNjk5NWRkNzNh"> </p>
<p class="cnM1N2NkYWYxOTRlNzQ4NjdhYWI5Yjg3NDcwNDA4MWU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">—---</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODc1MmRhNTA0ODRmNWQ4MGNhMzExMzQzNmU4ZGE5"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZGFiNTgyMGQwNzRiNjk4MWQ5ZDYzNWZjOWEyMmMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Work, repairs, and upgrades all continued. The forging of sensor dampening panels made out of the meta material had turned into a massive task, until I just decided to make the Nanopaste do it. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDA3NjBhOWUxNTQ1Y2NhMmI1YTljNjA0NDFjZGI5"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZTU2OWM0ZjlkZjQzNDVhMDM2ZTAyNjc0ZDU2NzMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure it probably wasn’t a good idea to make sensor protected nanopaste, but needs must. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTJkMzQxZjU4MTQxMTY5NWNmYjIxYmZjODI1YmJk"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YTI0MGYwNzE5NzQxMGY5YmU1ZTI3MjQ4MjQ4NDZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet the return of the Baron was what caused me to look out the viewport of the Phantom Star’s bridge as I watched the Octavius fly in.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjEzMDIxMWZlMDRjNjQ5NThlNTg4ZDgzOGU3NDky"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYWIwYWM4YzFhMTQxYzhiNDg1ZDMzZWZhYmZkNmFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had already received a message from him before he even docked that he would like my presence for a meeting.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTliZThlY2ViYjRiYTViZDk0NTM2NGM1YTkwMjQ3"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNjM0Mzg0ODAwZDQwZWZiYmM3ZTJjZjkxYTU2Y2Ux"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is so annoying.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is? Is it red?” I blinked at the question as I looked at the Crabbit hovering around me. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzEwMTE4MzIzMjQyOGY4MGRhZTQ1NjE1MmViYWRj"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYWFlYzA0MjQ2NjRmMTg5NjU2M2MzODgwOGM5MTNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No it’s not red. Just annoying. The Baron wants me to work for him. He won’t leave me alone.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWNhNTcwOTU0NDQyMzJiMTE1MmJlNDEyYzAxMjE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Is that bad?” The simple question stopped me because, honestly it probably wouldn’t be. The Baron had shown obvious intentions to try and tempt me with the carrot at every turn. He wasn’t… Evil or something like I would have expected. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWE2YWYxYzkwNzQ2YzliZGIyNzAzN2JjMmYxMmRl"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZDFhM2JkZmMzZjQzOWU5MDZjYmM0NDFkYzliYzZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a normal man. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWQ0NjA1ZDgyNDQwZWNhYjM0NmYwOGEzMGIzZDYz"> </p>
<p class="cnM0N2Y2MzQ4OWIwOTRiNWY5NDA3NGU5NzRjNWZmNzY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just not what I want.” I decide and the Crabbit takes that information in for a moment as it floats around before she finally comes to her own conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmY3OWYwMjM3ZjQzZGU4MDNhODBjMmVlZDQ2MGY3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZDI2YjIzNmFiOTQ3NGQ4MzIyYTU4NzQ5NmE1ZThl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If Kat doesn’t want to, Kat shouldn’t do it!” She decided and I smirked. Childish logic at its core, but tempting all the same.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2JjMTQxZWMxNjRmYWI4MWVlYzczOGNiYjllZjE4"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNTZiODU4Nzk5NzQ4Nzk4MjIwM2JmMGJhMDYwZjFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched as the Octavius docked and turned away from the view out into space, towards the future I wanted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjIzYzgyYTczMjRmY2Q5NGFkOTc2MWEyOGM3NDEy"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZjUxYjY4NzMzZDQ0NWU4NTNkOTkwZDRkNTg2NzA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Back to the reality of the situation of now. A bit of work, which was fine. The Phantom Star wasn’t ready just yet, so I’d do this to buy more time.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTY3YWE2MDc5MjQ1NDk4YTkxMDZiOTJiNzkyMGU3"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZGYyZGQxYzVhOTQ0ZWViOWU2YmVmZmZjODY1OWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s all I needed to do, just get some more time.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTI1MDYyMmQ3ZTRjYzc5NmY2ZWE4OWFlZWViODM2"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YTVhMTkzOTBlNTRjZThiMWZiMzgyNWQ1ZmIyZGJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2FkMDI2NDY0MTQ2YTNhNmRlODUxNWI0ZDEwMWQy"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMzFmOWYyNjU2OTRiMzc4NDYwYmRkNjI4N2I5Mzc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain! A delight to see you again! You have no idea how much I looked forward to this!” Engineer Eugene greeted me effusively as I was escorted, not into an expensive meeting room like I had expected, but instead a more familiar engineering bay. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDU4M2I4YTc2NDQzMTRhNjM4NmFjYjgzNjA4NWYy"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MzNhNzZmNjM4ODQ1NDc5YjBiNTllYjA2ODIxYzhi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t help but look around. The engine room of the Octavius was just large enough that it felt like some massive ship room, rather than the cramped little hole my own was. More like walking into an engine room on the Enterprise, or something than what I was used to.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGJiZDcxYzdmYjQ5MTZhMGI5YTAzYWE1YWVhMTgx"> </p>
<p class="cnM0M2FhMWViMmE0YzQwZTU4M2VhOGFiOWEyMDFhMzZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was… Cool.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2VlOGFiMWVhZTQ1MTQ5OGFlNDkxYjVkZDAyY2U0"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NGE1OWMwMjQzNjRkZDJhMTRkNWVmZjY0YWExMDQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I got the message, and I can guess what it’s about?” I offered and Eugene went serious, waving away at the soldiers that had led me here, which they promptly left.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWI0Yjk5NjkyNzRmYzk4YjlkOTIxZjZkODNjZjlk"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNWY1ZDcxNGM1ODQ5NTdhZGRlMGU3MzZkN2U1ZjIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed! Come, I have everything you requested already prepared and the tools, and since the Octavius is docked, all the computing power you might need. Are you ready?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I’ll ever be.” I said as I followed him to a little side of the engine room, a workbench was set up with two chairs. Eugene had planned ahead. I settled in, noticing it was a much larger chair meant for soldiers so it actually fit me, as I looked over the parts he had laid out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODQwNjYwMmM3YzQ2ODM5MjM4MjEwZDNkN2M4MTUy"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NzllY2UxZDkwMjQxYzZiOTY0Yzc4MTcwZjUxMjcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was basically a similar looking copy of the SDA I had made, a warp controller stacked on top of another like a ringed pyramid.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTQ5NTU4MTkyNjQ3MDc5MGZjOGUwYjU2MDJmZmEy"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZGI0NDMxMjIzYzRiZTNhNTU1YWQ4ZjA0ZjhlMWRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly pulled it apart, and started looking over it, the song in my ear guided me, as I explored the internals, even noticing a bad connection between the controllers, and quickly grabbed a soldering iron and redoing the node.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWU4M2JkMDliNTQxNzc4NTk2OTRjODcyNGU1MzRk"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NmEzNDExYzhmNjRiZWNiODA2NDk1NDM4YzVmZTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once that was done, I nodded. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDI0NzMzNTY1YzQ1YjQ5MTZmMzk0NjNiODM0ZWFj"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZGMxMTgzYTJlMjQyZGVhY2M2OWM4Yzg2M2Q0ZDQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It should work.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed.” Eugene mentioned with a tone of voice as if he was thinking hard. “I’m glad the hardware is acceptable, but it’s the code that truly represents the difficulty.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. I’ll need the data on the Iris Drive, and dimensions of the ship.” I said, and pulled out my Tab, grabbing the copy of the data that let the Phantoms SDA work, I took a deep breath and settled in to alter the code to work on a new ship.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTUxMWE3OTM0YzRkNmM5NWY0OTg0OGI1ODUyMjU4"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNTcwMTcyMjY3ZTQ2MjJhODFmMmZjMTg4MWEwZDFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took even longer than I would have liked with Eugene’s constant poking and prodding about what I was doing, but he would have to repair the thing if it ever went bad, so I didn’t take it personally. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmQ2MTc1YzI1MDQyMWM5ZGFjYWE5NTllZmM3ZTFm"> </p>

<p class="cnM1ODdmOWI2NmM2NzRiMGRiZWFjODFiZTY1MTU0NmJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright! Check the strut integrity! No messing around!” I called out, as I watched from inside the Phantom Star as the second wing of the ship was brought up to the connection and integration began.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzhjM2VmMjVhZjQ3MDNiNGNmZjJhMzgyN2JlZmZi"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYmY2YTgyNmY1ZjRjNTdhNDEwOWNkZmMwMDc0YTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily with all theCrabbit working together, they could bring it up perfectly in line with the place it was meant to attach onto the ship, but that still meant that I had to make sure the connection was perfect.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2U1MzZjOGUwNDQ4NjA5ZWQ5N2EwYTdlNWVkYWVi"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YTQxYjA5MTcxYjQzZjdhNjA2ZTNmOWJiODNmOWM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t want my ship ripping itself apart because it was off by a micrometer. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmRmOGMwZGY2NDQ1MjBhZjlhN2I2YjdjZDU4NTE0"> </p>

<p class="cnNhMmFkZmJjYzEwMTQyODZiOTdlMjBlODMzNTc4ZTk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was mine, back when I lived on Franks Hollow.” Mom said and then placed the blaster onto the table in front of me. “It’s still functional. Don’t expect much from it, it’s just a bit of protection I used to need. But… I wanted you to have it when you left.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTc5NmI5ZGIwNjRiMjE4YmQ0MGM4ODBmZmY4ODli"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNzc5OGViMGMwODQ1ODliNDcyNWZlMjkzOWNlY2Qx"><span style="font-weight: 400">A blaster was an energy weapon. Not a laser, as that was a bit different. It shot off bolts of contained plasma.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzEyZGUxYWY0NDQ2NjNiOTkwZDk5NTQ0Nzg4NzM2"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NzAxZTU2OTUwYzQxNTdiYzM5ZjU0ZmE1Y2MyY2Rj"><span style="font-weight: 400">A mix between an old slugthrower, like back on earth, and laser weapons. Not as accurate as a laser, but bolts had their own advantages in a fight. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzODYwZjI2NmM3ODRjNDRhNTQ2NmZmZDk3Nzk5YzM0"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t know you had a blaster.” I finally said because it was the only thing in my mind. My Mom had always been a socialite. Not a fighter.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWMyN2E1NDkzODRhM2JiMWRiYjZjOTVkOWJlYTFk"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMjcxMDA4ZmRmNjQ3ODA5YTE5ODg2YmYzMmQ3ZTk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s a lot about my life before you were born I never told you about.” She finally said. “That is all behind me. Take that, and protect yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTYwMjA2NDU0MzQ4MmViZTIyMzQ5ZmQ1MDhmNmY5"> </p>
<p class="cnMyODZlY2U5Yzg4NTRkZjM4N2UyZDAzNDZmMjgzN2U4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached out, and handled the blaster carefully. Old, a bit worn, and it was mostly plastic. If I was being entirely honest it was kind of ugly. The sort of blaster you’d expect to be bought cheaply, for someone absolutely in need of it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODM5YWI0ZDU0NTRjMjRhNDVkM2QxYzRjOTM2MWEw"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMzkyYzljNDFiYjRhNTliMzgzYTViZTYwMzFkM2Zk"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was functional, and more importantly, I could always work on it a bit.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2U1ZTBkZjY2MzQyZTM4MTk2NjFmNWRkYjUyNjUw"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMTExOTBmNDAwYjQyYWU5MjAyZWYxNDc1MzhmZDRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks Mom.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM1YWY5ODg3NTM3YzQ2MzA5ODBmZTQwNmNjNmYxYWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Open the Diamond Drive!” I called out firmly, I was nervous, but I didn’t want to show that to the Crabbit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjMyZGQwMTU1ZjRhZWRhYzM3NWMyNjdkZjQwOWZj"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZjBlZTQ1Nzk4MzRhODc4YzlkZDk0OTlmMTZjM2Zl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven Light Iris Drives were floating around me, held in place by Crabbits as I looked at the new Diamond Drive. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWVkNzExOThkMDQxNWM4NjJiNDY4ZDg5NjRhNjQz"> </p>
<p class="cnM5OTIyMDY5NDViYTQ2NTk4YjZiYjZmZWY3ZTY1YjAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had done test after test to make sure. It was… Perfect. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmMwNjI2MzYyYzRmMTc5MzljZGU1NDM3MTE3ODhk"> </p>
<p class="cnMyODU1ZjViYWM3MzRmZDA4YmMzNGFlM2IwNTcxYWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">My stomach didn’t care though. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkODRjZGU5Y2NjYTQ3OTU5ODQ0ZTE1YjNiOTY4M2Q5"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMTkyMjNlNmQ5ZDRiZjFiZTAxZGYyM2E5MWZlMjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The much larger Diamond Drive opened, revealing the inner slot for the core drive. “Insert the core!” I called watching as the Crabbit floated over and gently slotted in the Light Drive. The Light Drives were much larger than the small drives of the old system. So it took a moment for it to be settled in place. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDI3YzBmODFjOTQ5YWQ5NmUyYTc3M2QxZWQ2Y2Qy"> </p>
<p class="cnNkM2M1MDFlOTZjNDQxZTdhYTIyZDI1NzAwYjY5NjJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched as the Diamond Drive screwed shut, the deep glow of the Light Drive already peaking through. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkODEyZWE4YjhkZTRhMzJhZjllOTNhMjI1MDI4ZWRk"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NDJiNTQxYjlkZjQyN2E4OTkxMTdhMjAwNjJiYmI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Insert the Iris Drive Array.” I said and the Crabbit floated in, each of them carrying the glowing foot wide squares. It was time. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTE1ZjJkMjlkMTRjYjg4MmQ2MzQ4MTljZWZmOGYx"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYTMyNzYwMTgxODRiMmY4YzYwZjhmZmU5MGFkODRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were each inserted, each of them had been very specifically gone over, and each drive had a unique slot just for that drive. Just in case.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODI5YTc4NWE3ZTRjM2E4NGFmNjMxZmJkZWJmNTBj"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNGY0NjcxMThmMTQ1MmQ4ZjRiMDNkMDA5ZTg2YjU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then as it was all put together. The entire mechanism clamped down, becoming nearly a perfect octahedron.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWE3MGUzNWU3ZTRhZjJiZjc0NGE4Zjk4NTk4ZGNk"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYjFhNDliYmNiNTRjM2JiOGE5MWQ1NDE0YTIwMzBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The blue glow of the Iris Drives filled the room, and I took a breath. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZThmNjJhYmJjMTQ0MjViNDA1ZDg3YzdhZDliMzM4"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMjllODY2MWJkYTQ4N2M4MTVmN2Q5ZWJjMWQxZTdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ignite the Diamond Drive.” And ignite it did. A wicked rumble began and I wanted to flinch back at the way the song of the Iris Drives shifted, and screamed, but it wasn’t agony, more like…</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGM3NmYxMzJjZjQ3NjViNTk0MjI2YzEzYmUwZTQy"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NDI5YjkyNzk4NjRiNmE5NWUwZjJkOWQ5YTVkMjk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavy Metal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWFmZGMzZTEyZjRhNTQ5NTE5NjhmYjFhYTM0NGM1"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZGM0NWJhMjliMzRlZTY5ZmNlODMxNDlkNmY0YWE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">A wild cascade of noise, a roar.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2I1MWE4Mzk2NzQxMGFiM2ZiNjc0ZTMyZTdmNzk1"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYzcyZWFlOWFhYjRiZDE4NWEwNjQ0MmI4YjRmODM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">And the blue turned red, as the Diamond Drive ignited. “Insert the drive.” I confirmed once it settled down, and watched as the Diamond Drive was slowly lowered into its new slot.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmZkMTg5NGVjYjRmYTlhOWUwNGQ5M2Q0NTdhYmNm"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YWNjNTRkNTE3ZDQ4MTU4ZTZkOWM4YTEzOWMzZThk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had realized that if anyone found out about my drive I’d be in trouble, so I’d come up with this as a solution.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjExMDEwODY5ZDRiZjZhODM2MTc2NzI2MDUxNzk1"> </p>
<p class="cnNlOWI0MDljMWJjMjRjZjhiNzUwNzQ3YzM4MmQ5ZjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Diamond drive was lowered into an assembly on the floor, and then the metamaterial plates would clamp down on it, giving it added protection and keeping it out of sight, then another assembly would be lowered, that had basically a mock Iris Drive resting on it. It glowed, it was all hooked up, and it would help keep casual examination from noticing the truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzZmOGViYTliOTQxMjA4MGQ5MmE2OGM1MWI5NGIy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YzIwMjgyYmI3NTRmMjc5NzI0Y2MwMzQwNDBmN2Mx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The old Diamond Drive was still there as well, it was fitted into the roof for now, but I would likely need to do a full remodel on the entire engine room, if or when I ever got enough larger Iris Drives.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTAzNTg5YTIwMjQ1ZmRiNDEwZWEyNGMwY2VjZWNi"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZGMyYTFhZWZlMjQzZTBiZjI3NGI4NmNkMGRjYjE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Engine room settled in, as everything was locked in place, and sealed away </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjc4OTQ3ZDUyMzRiM2JiMTU0YjQ2OTVmYTVlMDQw"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZTk4NDQyNGExZTRmZWI5ZWViNTFkMjc0ZWYzNzdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDYyNmZiMTFkMjQ4NDU5NzgzZThmZTI2ZWM2ZDcw"> </p>
<p class="cnMzOTQ0N2VjZGY4NDQzYWY4OGNiZGM3NTk1NTQ1NGYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjVkN2VmMTUxMDQwZjE4MTUxOGJjYTcwNjkxZDkz"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MDRmODE0NjdkODQ4OTBiYWIyOTI3ZGRjZTkwMTlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Final flight checks were being run, this was the first time the Phantom Star was going out into the stars with everything attached where it should be. She’d have twice the main engine power. And more than a few additional plasma thrusters for in atmosphere flight. She’d be speedy and sleek for a Corvette.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjExNDNjODQwOTQ2NDU5NDk0MTcyMWMzMDEwMTNi"> </p>
<p class="cnNiODYyMjMwYjljNDRiOTk5ZDdhNGQxY2E2ZDc0OTYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">And I wasn’t trying to run away just because we had gotten word that the Baron was coming back again for a visit. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDQzOGM2YmE0MzQwNGFhYWEzZjQ4NDFkMzMyMDVm"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZDVhODJiNDA2NDRkM2ZiZGFlYzE1MGEzOTIxZGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">He’d come back a few times, and each time it was just so awkward. He kept trying to be so nice to me! It was weird!</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDM5YTg2ZDEwNzRhMmM5Nzg1MThiYjliYzY0NWIw"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZTliNmE3NGRlZDRkZGU4NWIzYjNhN2EyMDU4YTQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">So I was preparing to go. Not because of him of course, I had a job!</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGIyYjRiY2FjYjQ4NmI5NzlmZmU5NGE0ODJmNDMx"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMTJjN2UzMjg5ZjQ5OWRhNDQ5ODFjMWU2ZjU0MGI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">But I was leaving early to hopefully avoid him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Mjc4ZGExZmM0NDRiY2M5M2ZjYTUyMjBlMzM3MmVh"> </p>
<p class="cnM2M2E0MDczNmNiODRhNThiZTU2MjY2ZWZhMGYwZDA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Status?” I asked, and I smirked as the response came back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDVkOTNkZTU5NjQ3ZmNiOWJkZDhmMjJkNDEwZGQw"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYzYzNWVhMGQ0ZTQyMTBhMTU3ZjZkZThlNzAyNTg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Green!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Green, green means good!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Greeeeeeen!” I nodded at my three bridge crew. Comms, Navigation and Tactical all agreed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTI1YzhkMTMwMTQxN2VhM2RhNmU3ZGE5MmUyNTEy"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZmU2MTQzMTM5NTRjZWFiNDIwMWYyOWU0NjY5NTQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then let’s go. I’m completing decouple.” I called out and felt the slight tremor of the airlock closing shut and the umbilical returning to the Station. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzI1Y2Y3OWJiZDQ2ZjFhYTViNWE1N2QyZDlkM2Y5"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNzc4ZjNlMTU1YzQxODY5NGM2MmI3YTA0NjNjNjdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">For just a moment the Phantom Star was still, and I hesitated. This was it. The final time I’d leave as just a normal kid. With this, I was heading into the stars alone, at the head of my own ship, and all of space was opening up before me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODFlNDFlYzY3NDRmZTA4ZjgwZTgzOTM2ZDE3MzUy"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NDFkNTAzNjM0ZTQ2ZWNiZGFiMzVkZTRmYTY4Yjdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">My hand touched the controls and I pushed forward. I slowly increased power, the ship smoothly moving, picking up speed, and then, once I was clear, I really pushed her forward the rest of the way.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDJjNWY0YzFiNTQwNmFiYTNiODdkZDJjMGUyMTlk"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NzYxZTAwM2FhMDRiZWRiYTY3NWYyOTg0OGE2ZTU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was my time to fly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDc0ZDQwMzY4NzQ1YzdiODQ4NWY1ODEyMWU4MmJl"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NTczOWNlM2VmMDRiZDI4MjdlNmIzNTJlN2U2ZjUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Phantom Star purred, as the engines all entwined their gravity fields, and this time there wasn’t a weight issue. They were all working at full efficiency and then some.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2QyNGE1YmZhYTQzYmZiYmMwNDNhZTVhOWE2Mzkx"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MDM4YTljMjI2ZDQ3NTc5Zjc1ZmU1NWZjMDA1ZWQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t like I was hurting for power, so the engines got a whole lot of juice. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDc0ZWM0OWI3MzRmOWZiMDQyMzMyMGVlZTFkYTMy"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZjJhYzU1ZWYzNzQ2MzhhNDA0ZDQyOGRhYTZhMzkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then we were gone, rocketing away from the Station with a speed that would be startling to anyone thinking my girl was still as slow as she had been before.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjE5MDI5M2UxYjRiNzc4ZTIyZDcyMmVjNTk2MmRl"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZWQ1Nzc4MWVjNjQ2MTk5MGI1MjM0YWE0ZmY1YWJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t take long at all, to move outside a safe distance, and then with a flick of a switch everything was all green, and I dived into subspace. The ship moved within that ethereal realm at more than twice the speed I had been able to achieve before. As the Phantom Stars engines opened up and shot me forward, towards my destiny.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTZkNGMxYjc0NzQ1ZWM5ZWJjZjdhYWZmZWJiMTYz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMjMwOTk5NjdhMDQ2MDZiYWNlZGYzMWVmNTg0MWQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Or at least my first normal job. I was a space trucker now…</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGMwMGZiOGIzZTRhNjdiNzI4MzM5YWY5ZmQyZTll"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMTM4ZTA4MTg2NDQ2NTQ5Yjk5YjU3YTJjMWIyNGE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And that’s enough staring into the abyss for today.” I decided aloud at that thought and tore myself away from the comfy captain chair. “Alright everyone. Light duty.” I called out, and the Crabbit cheered, light duty meant a majority of them could play around for a while.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2UwODdjN2E1YTRhNjNiMzA3MWI0MTllNDAyOGU3"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MDAwMmM5NjBkODQ3MGRhMDVkZDdhZWQzZDIwYmQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was tempted to head to my quarters and be lazy for a while, but I had just left, and there was still work to be done.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzAzY2Q1MDc4MzRkZDRhOWNlODcxMTMwM2YyMjZi"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNGVjMDM2YWYyMjRjZTVhYjE2ZTg4NTlhODIxZTk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the exterior stuff was out of reach thanks to being in subspace, so I was basically stuck with internals, which really sucked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjBjYTQxMWY4ZTRmMDU5MmUyN2QzOWVhMzc5ZDQ2"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMjY3M2RmZjRiOTQ2ZmNiZjI3Y2IwN2UwNGZjOGZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The shipments for some of my additional weapon systems had finally come in. Despite requesting them almost a year ago, it took this long for them to be transferred over.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmFmNDVmMTljNTRiMDFiZjA4MDdlYTQwMGNmZTli"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOWE0YWJkZGUwMjRhYjQ4MzFhZDhhNWFiZGFmOTA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had the big ones though. The ones I had requested through the Baron’s military connections.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGFiY2JkNmEyNDQ4NDRiOTA1NDU2YTQ4MThiOWIx"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYWIyZmEwZjhlMDQxMTE4NzQ5NTkyMWI3NDM1ZDk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eight Laser batteries and two missile racks rested in my hold just waiting for the time to install.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWJmMDA1NTI0MTRlZDM4NjAyMTY3Y2E3OTRlMzFm"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNjhmYTg4MTc2NjQxMDZiMWQzNzQyMzMyY2FmMTdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the connection points were already installed into the hull thankfully, but it was still a matter of installing them, and that wasn’t safe in subspace.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTM4ZGFiNDdjYjQzOTFiMDc5ODBmM2U0NDMwNzU4"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNDJiNjQ5OTNmNzRmNjhhNTVmYWUyY2VmZjMzMjJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">So they’d get installed slowly as I had time. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTI1ODAyYWY2ZTQ3NmViYzZkNGU5ODJjMWRhZGY1"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MmM0YjZkZGMzNTQyNDVhZGNjODI5MzZhMDJmN2M0"><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, that meant I was stuck working on internals, and for the most part that was done.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGM4MTE4YjI2NzQ1ZjFiNzJmNjVjYjkzMTIxNmJi"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MTUzNmViOWQwYzQ2OWZhODNhOGU4ODY0ODRiNzc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked through the halls that still didn’t have flooring. Most of the cables had been properly stashed away. Looking up I saw the neat rows of strapped down cabling that supplied power to different sections.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTExOTk5MDU3MDQxMmY5NGE0NzExZWY1YjY2M2Vj"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMzEzM2U1ZjdlNzQzNWI5NmFkYmQwNDljYTE2Zjlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I still had to finish installing the overhead lights, the Phantom wasn’t exactly dark, but there were sections where I had to use flashlights to get enough light to work.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWYwM2QyYWJmMDRhNDM5YmUzOGFjNzI4NWZlNjA3"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NDhiNzNhYzcwMzQ4OWJhNTRhYjNlNWQ1YWRiM2Ux"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where did I put the overhead lights?” I asked my shoulder Crabbit, and it hummed for a second.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjNiOGU5OGI2MjQ3ZjliOGQwMjRmZjIxOWNiNjIw"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNDNiNzEwZWM1ZjQ2ZDhiYWE4YjAyNjJlNTg2NDdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooh. Where is that? It’s not in the hold!” She told me, and then went back to processing. She was being cute, but she was actually checking the manifest. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTYwNWNmNjAzMDRiOGRhZmJmZThiNmNhYzE1ZWFm"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NWJiY2NiMzg2YjQ0MWVhYzhmZTZiY2E4OWQ2YmRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was pretty bad about remembering where everything was, so the Crabbit kept a manifest of stuff that I put down and forgot about.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2UwNmM4YzI0NDQxZDc5NjgwNmQ3MGViOTRkZTlk"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s in the Mess! You put them in the cupboards!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did I put them in the cupboards?” I wondered, and then instantly got my answer. As my own voice came out of the Crabbit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTMyMGFiMjY1ZjRlNjlhNDNmYjljMDFjZDYxZjIz"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNTIzMTAzNDkzOTQ3YTVhNjQ1ZDk1MDU3OTU0OGRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shit Fu-dge! I almost tripped! Put these lights in the cupboards until we’re installing them!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTVhMjc0ZmE2NDRkYjViYTM0Y2RlNWM3NzI4MTk1"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMDRkNTkxNzBmZDQzNmNiZjA4MmI5ZTk0YzdmYjYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped and looked at the Crabbit. She looked at me. I could, and probably should tell her to not record my voice like that. I’m absolutely sure I’m either going to regret it, or really appreciate that some day.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjNiYmQ5NmZmMTQyZDI4YTg5NzdhNjcxYzE2M2Nl"> </p>
<p class="cnM3N2NiMzJlZjJjMzRjODJhM2VlZjNlNTkzNmMxMTY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks.” I decided I’d roll that dice I supposed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTU0YjYxOGVkZDQ3YWY5NDAyZTA5ZmQ3NGMxNWM5"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZWIzODY1MGRjYTQ5MWJhZDYzODBmYzNhNTQ0YWIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Teehee! Of course Captain!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDk3MTAzYmExODRmYzdhODhmY2E0YzM1MDBjNTlh"> </p>

<p class="cnMzZWIxYmRmZDE3ZjRmYzhiNzkwMjQ5NDZjNzBhMGU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry they’re shy.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, are they running on Drives?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, they have Gravity Panels integrated for mobility, I needed at least an Iris to give them enough power.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTc5NWFiMDg2ZjQ2Y2U5ZTlhYzBjYjkxOWNhMTc4"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NmMyNWYwODJiMjRmZGY5NTdmZTgzM2Q4NzJkNTQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Crazy build, but I guess if you have the creds. You’re a spacer right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m a Captain.” I admitted, and the boy's eyes widened. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGEzNzcwZjkwNzRhYTNiZDJiMDkyYzYzN2I3YmI3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMWM0NDBlOGMxYzQ5Mzc4OWU3ZDMwYzM4YWYwMzQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoa, you’re so young! Did your family?” He asked, and I instantly understood what he was inferring. Did my family die and leave the ship to me?</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh they’re fine back home… Anyway, I’m going to look around.” I said and very purposefully looked away. I guess it was odd that I was so young captaining a ship, especially one like the Phantom. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTM1OTVjZGFkNzRhMDQ5NjQzNGM3N2JkN2U5NzY0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YTU4ZTJhZTQ3NDQ0NzU5NzZkM2ZiNjQzNDA0ZDRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was my business. I hummed a bit as I purposefully focused away from the boy. I listened, and heard the gentle chimes of the tech in the room. Some of the songs were brittle, some fritzed as they weren’t working properly. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzg1NTc1ODExNjQ4NTc5YWM5MjRjOWViMWY2ZDE1"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NGM2YWU2NTM2MjRiMzRhODliNDkxNDc2ZmFjMzNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I even heard the slightly tinny noise from my mothers blaster on my hip. It thankfully wasn’t too distracting wearing it, as it felt like any of the usual tools I had on my belt, but its song was a little off.<br/></span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGQ1MTA1OTBlNjRjYjc5YjMxNWY5ZmFjMTY2YWQz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNGI4ZmJkMTAxNDQ2ZThiZTRlZTA5ZjRmMTBmMTQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was functional, but I was going to have to do some work on it soon.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2EwMjRlYzBlYTQ4MjQ4ZjBmZTc4NWFmOTZmOWU3"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNjQ0ZDY5ZjJhZDQwYzg4Y2RjNmQ5YzI0NjUwOTM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then as if guided I walked towards the back, but unfortunately had to stop.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjBkOTU3YzZkMDRiNzQ5ZTU0ZDkyMmJlNTM2M2Qx"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MTM3ODRhZDJkYjQxY2FhZjZjMzE5YmZjMWMzYzJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s back there?” I asked, the doorway in the back of the shop called to me, a song that was familiar but odd in my ear.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTBlYTdiNWU3YjQxNjM5MGI1MzFiNGQ5NTM3MDhm"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMmVmYTM4ODBlZjQyYmM5NDY0ZDcyMGQ0MTIwOTZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Storage. Mostly.” The boy offered and then hesitated and shrugged. “If you want to check it out, I can show you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.” I agreed, and watched as he opened the door, and I felt myself smirk because this was more familiar. A mass of spare parts, and equipment all piled up randomly. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmMzMGNiNDM3YjQ3MWZiMjcxOGRmZjQxMjcxNjEw"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNWNkY2I1Mzc1ZDRlYTlhOGE0ZTY0MzE4YzlhZjE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">This is what a part shop should look like.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjc2MDkzZDQwNDQ1NDNhM2RmZjRiYzdlYjcyMmFm"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YjYzZDZkZTYxZDRkMTc4MTNiMDllMDM5ZGYyZmE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now we’re talking.” I couldn’t help but say as I followed him in, and looked around.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTJjYTgzZDg0YzRiMzViNDVjOWQyYzJlYjZlYTUw"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDM5ZGZkYmU5MjQ2OTg4MWVlMDkyOWEwNzhkYmE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lots of random bits and bobs, but that one song was still drawing me over and eventually led me to the side of the room where a stack of Shield Emitters were laid out, with junk covering them along with a good layer of dust.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzgxOTkyMjBiZDRmNWVhYmE5MmUwZTdiOGM3YmM4"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMGZiMGZlZjkzODQxNjJiMWZiY2YwZmU3YWVjNDgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s with these?” I couldn’t help but ask as I looked the emitters over and noticed just how different they were.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGIwM2FkZjVkZTQ0ZjRiODMxY2U2MDc3MWE3OWU1"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NzMzOTBiN2ZkMjRlNTE5ZTA4NjJkOTQwMDdmZDc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those old things? They’re weird. Shield emitters, but they’re not right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“They don’t act like normal shields. They’re combat rated deflectors, lasers, and such go right through.” Then he grimaced. “They disrupt normal shield fields too. So you can’t even double up on them or something. So no one wants them.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzMzOTcxOTgzNzQ1YTVhYmQ0MTAwY2ZmYzNmNGJm"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMjA3OWQyYWQzNzQ3ZGU4MDhmMTM4ZGNjZDVjYTQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hummed deep in my throat. No wonder they sounded so strange yet familiar. They were literally a different tech base. No one used deflectors as a shield tech, there were too many energy weapons in space. Sure every ship had a deflector dish, but that wouldn’t do squat in a fight, and basing your entire defense network on hoping the enemy didn’t have lasers?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Nzg2NzM4YTdjZTQ5NWViOWEwYzkxYTJhZGYzYjcw"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMDFhOTcwNzI3NjQ2MWNiZTU5MDk0MzYxZmRkZDRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmVkYjYwYWY2MjQ4MTJiMjE3MDczODllMjdhOTAy"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Any idea where they came from?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a clue, You’d have to ask my dad, he’s the one that originally picked them up, but that was years ago. He didn’t know they were duds when he picked them up.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll take them.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously? They don’t work, I mean, they do, but they’re useless.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re interesting, and maybe I can learn something from them. I’ll take them.” I confirmed and pulled out my Tab, to make the deal, the boy obviously realizing he was about to sell something they had been stuck with for a long time quickly grabbed his own Tab and made an offer. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2RjMTYwNDg5ZTRjMmRhMWFkMzFmZWVjNmIxM2I2"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YzMyZDY2YTNlNjRiNGM4YjA5YjE2Nzk1OGU5NDQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was fair, and I flicked the Creds over.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDZlODhmNDVmMjQxMTk4ODViMTE3M2VhMDE0Y2I2"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYjNlYTIyYzg4NTRiY2FhNTc4ZDZkZWQwYjdjNzEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well I guess I’d have an interesting project for my trip after all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWFmMGJmNjc4ZjQxZjhhODE4YzRkYmM3YTVlZDVk"> </p>
<p class="cnNkOTg3NGM2ZmY3NjQ2OGM4MTQwYTk3NTZiMWU2YWRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTIxMWU1YTA5ZjQ4MWVhNjQ1ZjgzYjBhZmFjYzY1"> </p>
<p class="cnMzOWNkNzBiZTI4ODRjZTliNGQ3ZWRhYmQ5NmNmODYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The next morning I was off, the Phantom flying off from the station and then dropping into subspace for a long flight to Stark Point.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NThiNjA1MjI2ZjQwMjJiZjJlZmU0ZWRkZjk0ZWI5"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YTA2MzBiYTMxMjQzNDFiZmE1ZjQzMTExYmIwYzJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Only when we were fully traveling along the course did I sit up from the captain's chair and head back towards the hold.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGZkZGI3NjI4MjQ3YTQ5YTdlZGUxOTBiZjUzZWE1"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYjAxZDUyODZjZTRmMzA4ZmQxMjkzMzc0MmQ1M2M1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost the entire cargo hold was full of massive containers, which was interesting to see as it left my normally empty room feeling like a cave network of small passages.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjQwYTYxYmQ3MTQ4MmNhMjM4M2Q4MjA0MDlkMTRl"> </p>
<p class="cnMzOTc2NGQyZDdjYzRhNzk4NTQ4OTc4ZjY5NGU4ZTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that I was going to try and play around in there. The containers were secure but accidents were called accidents for a reason.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWVhMDI4ZDYxZjQ5MjdhYzczOWE0ZTZhNDA1OTg3"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYTJkY2JmMzA2ODRmMDc4NGQ3ZDQ2ODRkOTlmNmI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead as I slid down the ladder to the bottom I headed to the small section where the stack of dusty shield emitters were left in a pile and rolled my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzcxNmI5NGYyZjRiMGViMWQ1NGIxODI1NGEzNzQw"> </p>
<p class="cnMzM2RiNWMyYWVmMTQ3YTA4NzdhODljODdhZmYxYmI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you lot doing?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weird!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weird!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjM2OWUzOGE3NzQ1N2M4MmUxY2ZhMGI3ZWQ5ZmQ2"> </p>
<p class="cnM4M2FmZDQ2ODNhNzQyNDk5ZmJmYjE1ZTk0MjZiMTQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crabbit commented back at me, as they were going over the emitters themselves.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzFjZjE1YzhjMTQxNWRhZGJlZjZhODUxZmU1Y2Ri"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZjcxYmVmZmRhMjQ0N2I4MGE3YWVhNjE5Mjg2YjQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weird? Is that the official decision of the council?” I teased, and the Crabbit each twitched and looked at me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjc0YmQ3NjQwNTQzZjdiMTg4YWI3OTMyZmU5MGNm"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Council? Are we supposed to have a council? Red! Red!” One of them chattered and the other nodded, and they both raced off, and I realized instantly I had made a mistake.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjZjYTMwNWI2YzQyNzY4YzAwMDUwZWYyNWZmYzg3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYzBiZTY5YTUxYTRkNTdiZmRjOTliM2E2OGFhNzdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aw well.” I muttered and settled back down, my shoulder Crabbit surprisingly didn’t run off and instead just moved a little close by holding onto my tanktop to look over my shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjgzN2MyM2FjZjQ0ZDhiNGVkYTY2MTVkOGUwMTVk"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YjNmMWU1ZDFlZDRmODhiMDBhODY4NGRhMGM1YmZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weird?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seems so.” I said, and pulled out some tools I had with me as I pulled one of the strands of emitters into my lap and started exploring.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjM0ODhiNjk5YzRiNGViNWQxNGU2ZTkzZmQxY2Mz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkODQwMjIwNDI2NDRkYjc4Y2JkMDY3M2FlNzZlZDM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">First I’d really like to know where these came from. So with an air blower and suction tool, I started blowing the dust from one of the sections of the strand. Usually there would be some company markings on it, and I could look it up with my Tab once I connected to the net again.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTBhNGNiMDc5MzQwOGJhNmIwMzFkYjZhNjQwYTVi"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZTI0N2ZmZmI0MjQyOGNiZDJhZDc5ZDIyMDg1NDdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">As I slowly worked, I hummed a little off tune to my usual, as I was mimicking the sound of the emitters, and I realized instantly that it was still a nice song. Simply different. But not wrong.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWNmZjU0NzhjMTQyODJhOTcwM2Q1YjAzYmVmNzJh"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMGRmZmIyN2RiZjQwYTBhZTRjMjMwNGI0M2QzNWM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">That only made me more sure I had made the right choice in picking these up. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTc3NWYyNDAyYzRmOGM4NDYzNTUxNTM1ZTkyOGFm"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MGE1NmZmMDUwZjQ0MzE5MTQyMmE3MzliMWEyODZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took a while, and a magnification using my Tab but I found the company logo. I copied it to the Tab to search later, and with that sorted, I started scanning the emitters.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGUxNWU2YmMzZDRhNzk5NTNjNGI4MWQyZmVhMGNi"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZGJjYTE2OTNlZjQ1YjFhNTlmYjY5ZWJkZWZiM2I2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Some would likely be no good and need some repair work after all this time of just laying around.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzE0MzI0YTAwOTQ5M2Q4OGM1MmQ0ZmYzMjhkYjBi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYTM4ZjI0OWVlZjRhYWI5OTMyMGYzODI4ZDUwNTNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">As I went over them I quickly realized just how different they were. Completely different concepts to normal shield emitters. Sort of like a group that had only heard about shield emitters and decided to try and make them on their own.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmEwYzdkNTE0MTQ1MTJhMzM2NzA5MzJiNTY0MDk5"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOGU4NTVhMTU5ZjQyMWVhYTVjYWUzM2NjNmY3NDIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering how large human space was, it was possible. Maybe a planet of colonists got lost until they went out exploring the wide empty space and found more humans again.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDhjMjI1ZmQwZjQxZTVhNDI1ZDczZjIwMGJkZDlk"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYjJlNGMyODMxNDRiZThiZWY0OGIxNzExNjNhMDE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It happened sometimes, more often out here on the frontier than not, which would explain this.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzRjNTdiNzI1YTQ1Nzg4MzZlYWQ0MzIzZjk0MjU2"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZWFkOGMwOTU5MDRhZThiYTY2NGE1M2Y3YTI2YWU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">These emitters were… Rough. Interesting but rough. Like looking at one of the first computers ever created and comparing it to an Ipad. They were both computers… Mostly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDc1ZDBjMzY2YzQ5MmQ5NzhhMzE4MmI4N2NjNzEy"> </p>
<p class="cnM1M2I2YmIyNmU0ZTQyZjdhN2JkZjA4M2ZmMGU1MjVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">But would these emitters play Doom? That was the real question.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWMyYWI4MTMxNTRkZjlhM2U5NzE3NzA5ZjNhMzI3"> </p>
<p class="cnNlY2I3MDFmNTEwYTRlNzdiMTU0OTk5MTg1M2RmOGQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I giggled to myself at the old joke as I started fiddling with them. So they were only capable of stopping projectiles and did nothing to energy weapons. That wasn’t entirely a bad thing. I might be able to see how they worked and integrate the idea into normal shield emitters. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTdmN2I4Y2I3YzQyYTc4ZTQ5NWI2ZTg2ZDEwMWIy"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMmEwNzliYzM4ZjQzNDliYmYxOGVlYjhmYTQ4NjFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Specialized shields were pretty common after all, and while the Kenish Duchy tended to specialize in laser weapons, the Idric Dominion specialized in projectile weapons. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWY2ODNlMDg2ZjRjNTlhN2RkMGNkOWFhODVjNjI2"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YjViYzQzMWYwYzQ4MTZhMDQzNDIzNWZiYzhlNjU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t exactly planning on running into a Dominion Battlegroup, but I was a Kenish citizen, and I was flying a warship of sorts.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzFkYjI3YTMwZjQxMjI5ODU0MDA3MWY5MWJiZGUx"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MzFiMTg3ZTBkYTRiOWY5MWY0YmFkYjVhNTM1ZjIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Best to be careful.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyZmVkZGY5NzIwNTRlNThiMDkxOGYyOTA5Y2JkN2U2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Marco!” I called out slowly walking through the hallways of my ship. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjhkMjlmZjBjNzQ3ZjRhOGM2Y2FmMjVjMDc5ZmE1"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NDJhMGJhYjlhYjQ5MWViM2U1ZmM2OGFiNGM0MmUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard some of the Crabbit that had already failed the game, tittering all around me, but finally one called out from down the hall. “Polo! Green!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2NhYjlkZjhjYTRmODliNmU1ODNjOGVlNmYxZjEy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYjQ5OWJlZmQ1OTRiOTc4ZTIyMTVjOTc3NGY0OWMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh you think you’re green do you?” I muttered darkly as I hurried down the hall and then came into the empty crew room. The light was off, which made sense because I didn’t have a light installed yet. I flicked a flashlight from my belt and looked around the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmM2NjA5NWU4MTQwN2ZiYzY1ODFjOGE2Njc2M2Nm"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMGNmNjMyM2IzZDRiZTg5ZWNiYTg5ZGZmMzRjM2Nj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The quiet titters of silly drones did not help my search at all, but it was to my benefit that the Crabbit hadn’t quite figured out sneaky yet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmFiYjAzNzM4ODRhMjJhYTk1ODdiMzUxNWVlZTY1"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZWJmN2MzMTIyNTQ2ODU4MWRhZmM4YWYyYmI0NGZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took three steps in and instantly knew what had happened.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODljNGM5OGVlNDRmMmViN2NiYWRmYzU5NjM4ZjA2"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZDJlYWIxYzEyYjRkYWVhMDA3NzA1NzkwY2Y4MzNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. Where could my Crabbit be hiding? In… Here!?” I faked spinning around and looking up at the ceiling above the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2NjMjg0NWVkMjQyNmM5NDY0NDU0YjllNjFlYjAy"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MjY0ZmE1NWU0YTQ5N2I4NDYyMTUwOGIxYTJjZTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly I heard titters, and the Crabbit that had been badly hiding their attempts to follow me thought it was hilarious, peeking their head around the door and giggling.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDdkZWQyZjlhYjRmODQ5NWQwYWVmYjBlNzQ1Njdl"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMzg4MjkwNWJlMjQyZmI5OTY3ZWUyODc2ZGYyNTZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I had found all of these Crabbit already, and with how many of them I had grabbed it was getting harder to find the last few because of all the giggles following me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTczYmJkZDQ3NjRmNjA4ZTZkMDQ2YjEyMGIzMmU4"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNjAzYjAxYjdlMzRjMjZhMWMyMzlmMzEwNGMyMTBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">But I had already spotted this one, I was just giving her a bit of fun.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGJhNjA5MDVmMTQ5YjY5OTFiMTI3MGM0ZDI1ZWUx"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZDM2YjBmOWFiZjQ2NGM4OTQzOWJkODY3YWI3ZTVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I rolled my eyes, took two steps back and then reached out and grabbed the floating floor plate that I don’t even want to know where she grabbed it from.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzVlNmMyNjQ3MDRiMjliOTA3ZmE1YjJlMzcwNWQy"> </p>

<p class="cnM4MTM5MDUzMGMzZTQxZjViZWI2ODBjZjYzMzk3MWFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it also sounded perfectly in sync.

All growth must follow code! No bad builds!” The Crabbit chattered as she floated around checking the vats. I joined her climbing up the ladder and looking in and nodding. The chunks of scrap metal that had once filled the vats now looked like a bubbling goop. The vats were connected to channels that could release the Nanopaste onto the section of the ship that needed repair. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzYxNTcwMTEwODRkZWQ5YWIyOWUxMmQwY2MxOGIz"> </p>
<p class="cnNlODlhNDFjMjQ3ZjQ0NzliYWEwZTNjZWRjMTc0NWY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had decided to make it all into a secret room, because Nanopaste was something that tended to get people upset. This entire room like the engine room was covered in sensor dampening materials, and it should make anyone that scans me think the entire thing is just more armor. Mostly because there was already a lot of armor covering this section.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlZjU0ZDIwMjljMDRlMjdiMTAzOTY2Mzg0NDE2MWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a reason I made sure a Crabbit was in charge of them. The tiny nanomachines didn’t have the processing power to do all the checks and tests they needed to make sure there wouldn’t be a problem, but a Crabbit, even a lone one did. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">So there was always a Crabbit minder offering a large chunk of its processing power to the nanomachines. </span></p>

<p class="cnMzYzEyYTVhYWJmMDQxYmU5YTlhN2YzMmM2YjI4N2Fi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked down into the vats and the grey goo inside was actually trillions of nanomachines and some clean water. The nanomachines used the water molecules as a heatsink and it made them look like a goo.</span></p>

<p class="cnM2NGM4OTI0YjM2MDQwYmVhZjc5ZWU2MTFlYTZkMGZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good work everyone.” I whispered into the vat, and climbed back down and out. That was all the checks. Maybe I’d go up to the bridge and sit in the comfy chair and read a book.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkNzY3N2JlZjMzNzQ2MWFiYTUwN2ZlYzBjZWQ0NDEw"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMTU3NWZiNjdiNjRiMDM5MWY4MjFkN2UxMGJmOTA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my own eyebrows shift together in irritation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmE3YTMzNzBjMTQ3ZmE4MmY3ZjkzMjgyNmU2ODFj"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMmRjMGIzNjA5YTRlNGE4NGIxMzc1YzcyNmM0YmEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I know my face was a bit blunt because of the gene mods, and it made me a bit self conscious of my looks.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTVkYzU4ZDQ3YjQ5ZjBhOGQwYmNkYzJiYWI1MGY3"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMTBkMDllNDRkNjRiMTQ4YzRkNzY5ZjRlOWRjMWRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t appreciate the harsh eyes roving my face.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzODNmZGI3OGE1NDRmN2Y5MzBhOGI0NWFmOGYyOGQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well well, an outsider well and true. You the one that demands the use of my family's Hauler?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t demand-”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up, void trash. I wasn’t actually asking.” He snapped back instantly and I flinched from the threat of violence.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2I0ODM3NDVmOTRmYmZiMzZkZTdiNGQ4MzFjOTg4"> </p>
<p class="cnMxY2YwY2Y5YmRiOTQ4ZDA5MTlhNDVlNTQ4ZThmZDUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">What the fuck? I knew frontier worlds could be rough and tumble, but this was…</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjYwYTcyYTFmMzRkMWY5ZmU5NzUxNWZjZGViY2M1"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZjljMTVjNzUyOTQxMGY4Y2NhMDZjYjk5MzhiMTU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">This guy… He would absolutely shoot me if he felt like it.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmNmZlNmNlNzJjMDRjOTliMjdhYWZmNjU5MzBmOWY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly had the sinking realization that there were no police, or guards here to protect me. I was alone in a strange world with strange men and women.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjc0YzZjMmI3ODRhMjM5M2UzNDVmYTM4ZTEyNDNh"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NjRlZjlmY2QxNzQxMjI5YmM5MjYwZjk3YTNlMzY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuck I didn’t even have more than an old medkit on the Phantom Star in case something happened. Stupid. Really stupid.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlNmRjMWIwYzAwZTQwMzA4NzM3YmJlMDRjMWRlYmVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Custer.” Old Stark growled and the boy didn’t respond to the threat with anything, but turned his eyes from me to the older man.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlMWU3YzUxODljZTRlMGVhYmQyODg3ZGI4NGUyZGNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well Old Dirt. You going to explain?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I called your home and Martin picked up. I explained that I was calling in the hauler duty as per the law.” He said back and Custer didn’t look like he appreciated it. His hand didn’t quite reach for his gun. But it was close.</span></p>

If you want something from the Wellings, you talk to me. Not Martin. Not old Nam. Me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Stark seemed to mull over how to respond for a moment, and took a swig of his drink, seemingly to buy time.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3YzEwMTJlYWZkNTQxMDJiZTgxYTNlMjY1Y2M0NDY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll do what I need as Governor when an emergency arises.” He finally stated, and that was a challenge. </span></p>

<p class="cnMzOGQyYzRjNjNjNTQ4MjE4OTkzNDQ3MDdhODY1NGQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah you think so? Maybe your oh so important ship captain will end up dead-” He said and I started to rise up as soon as I realized he was threatening me. Nope. I don’t want anything to do with this.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTUzNjc1MDRhMjQzNWFiNmEyYTJlMDU2OGM0ZDFk"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNzY5YjcwZTk3MzRjOWViZDRlZmQ3ZDRiMjYzNjI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">His hand shot out to grab my arm as I rose up, but his hand slipped a bit as he couldn’t quite get a grip, and I just kept going. The motion unbalanced the man.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDhhYzQ0ODQxNTQ0NGQ5NTVmZTI3MjExNzJmNWRl"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZGY3ZTNkMDk5MjQ1MmI4ZTYyYjg3MTJmNmU0ZTc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">He nearly fell off the table as I stepped back to try and get some distance and he went right with me, his hand scrambling on the fabric of my jumpsuit.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwNzVlNDZlY2MyMDQ0NjhiZjBjYjYxZjYyNGExZmYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The guy was only about five foot nothing. And I think he weighed about a hundred pounds soaking wet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">That didn’t make him not dangerous with that gun, but he certainly wasn’t going to stop me from moving as I moved back and suddenly he was on his feet facing me scrambling to hold me still and then.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmZkZjllMDI5NDQyNzFiMzAxYmNhMzI3YzEyN2Mz"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMDhjMmFkMGIwZjQxNWFhNzAzMzA0NmVlZDIyN2M1"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a moment where he was looking up at me, and I was looking down at him.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4N2JlZTA5MWFiMTQyNDc5ZGJlNjhiNTA0YzUyMjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">He let go of me then, and I took a few steps back. I wasn’t about to stick around for a gun fight at the Stark Corral so to speak.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDY1YzI2ZDJmYjQxZDA4NDk1MmJkOWRkNzhmYzhl"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OGJkOWUxMzliZTRkNDZiMDZkZGViNjI4YjVlN2Jl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll be back at my ship.” I stated loudly, and then turned and hurried away the… Brothers? That had been at the door stepped aside in a hurry as I brushed past them. Hurrying past the cargo hauler that was idling out front of the bar. And then I hurried to the ship. Just managing to keep myself from running.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTkxMGQ4ODczZTQzOGU5MTE4YjQwOTMxZmE2ZTI2"> </p>

<p class="cnNhZTBhZGI4YzJkMDQ3ZWU4MzUyYzkxYjhlMGUyMzll"><span style="font-weight: 400">The brothers thankfully didn’t follow, and I think my sudden and hasty departure saved me from anyone thinking to follow me, as I rushed back onto my ship as fast as my long legs could take me without breaking out into a sprint. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTA3ODZhNjRiNTRkMDJhMDI5YWY1ZDg1NzcxYmVj"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMjA3NzQxNmRmYTQ2ZWE5Y2Y3ZDUyMjBjYmFhZDEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately hit the hold door, watching as the armored wall of metal that would laugh at any handheld weapon these… Assholes! Would have!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTQzNjQ1MTU4ODQyZThiZDI0MTFhZWQ3ODAxZTkw"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NDBhZGUxMDBlODRiYzFiZjk4OTgxYzcwMmU2MDFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah! Assholes!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTMyNDYxOTEwODRlN2JhYTIzNmQ2MmIxYTliNWE3"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMGE1MTNkY2UxZDQ1NTZhMDhjMGM1ZDBiOTc2ZTMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Only when the door shut did I realize I was pressing my back against one of the containers and then I weakly slid down until I was sitting.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmQ1NTRlNjZkYjQxNjRhNGVhOTFiNjU5MzFmZWRl"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNWZkZDBkMmMxODQyOWY5ZDU1NzgyM2Q5MjVlNTM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Scary.” I breathed out, my heart hammering a mile a minute. Someone had pointed a gun at me!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDQxMWJkODY1NTQyMjM5YjdhNGNhMTg4NWQ0YjU3"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMDdmMjFjZWM5MzQxMDc4ZDlhNjcwZjkwN2VhZjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">A gun!</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjJkYTA1N2E4YzQyY2U4ODZiMTYwOGVlYjIxZWQy"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NDNhYmQwODIzZjQ5YTBiMTMwMWQ3NGNlY2JhZmUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Scary! It was scary!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTY0ZDY1ZjViYjRkMGJiMWNkZDU0ZjQ3MTY5MGJm"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNWI5OTQyNmI1MDQ2OGRhN2VkYzNhOWNmZmZkYmJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was I supposed to do? Sure I had a gun too, but that would just lead to a gun fight! I didn’t have armor! Or a shield! I barely knew how to shoot a gun!</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzg0MjBiY2QyMDRjZDViZTYzMWFiMzRmOGQ2YjFh"> </p>
<p class="cnM0OWNlYjdmMGIwYjQ1ZWFiNTQwYTA0ZGYxZjgwMmNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I could have died.” I whispered to myself in realization.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGMyOTY4MWJhYzQ1NTBiMjMzMGNkYmY3MTUwZGQx"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYmI1ZTljOWY5NzRjNzM5YTBlMDQ3M2U5MTM2ZDMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bad. Red.” Came from my back and I looked over at the Crabbit that was still holding onto me. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWQ3MDAxYjhiZTQwODBhYmM3YTVhMjE4MDQ3MzRh"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOGRmYWQwN2RhYzRjNGRhODQ0NzFhNTEyYWFiMzNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.” I agreed, and her face shifted into a glare. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjJkZjVjYzYyZjRjNTViMWIzMTJjMjhiNWQzODY4"> </p>
<p class="cnNmOWM3MTZmNDkxYjQxN2E4N2Y2NTYyODVlNDllMjE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We should shoot them. Main battery!” She offered and I blinked at the words, before snorting, I couldn’t help it. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTgwM2M5ZWZhMzRiOWNiOThjZWFkZWU4ODU5NWFl"> </p>
<p class="cnMzODM3NDI2NTE0MzQwZTVhOGUyOTk4MmY1ZmQ4NzUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a bit overkill, but the guide lasers would do fine.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… No boom.” She told me, and that helped me relax. I took a breath and let it out in a loud exhale. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTMwY2ZkNTZlZjQyNWZhMjM0ZTg0MjQxMzY0OWU1"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNTk4MmI2ODA2YTQ5MzVhMTM3YWU0MWU0MmI5M2Nm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Let’s get everything locked down. I’m sure the assholes are going to be around. I’m letting the locals figure this out, and we aren’t opening the doors until I have some assurances.” I stood up a bit shakily, my knees felt weak, but I marched to the back of the hold and climbed the ladder. A nice comfy captain's chair would make me feel better. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmMwOWM1YWEzMzQxYTVhZDVkMTM3NWJhNjZkYzNk"> </p>
<p class="cnMyM2U5ZThlOTNlZTQ5NDA4OGM4N2E1YmMxNjZjYzky"><span style="font-weight: 400">But… What was I going to do? That had gone from normal to dangerous in a heartbeat. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTA1M2M0MTQzMzQ3NmNhNmVjNTc0OTVlMjUzYWE0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZGJjYjdkOTkzYzRkNTk4Nzc5NzgzODMwMDMzNTEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWExZTljMjYyMTQ5YzM4YWE5ZDlmMmZhMDMwODdm"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MmM0ZTBkZDYxZTQ4YWY5MDgyOGZhZjg4ODdiNTc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Comm Message! Comm Message!” The Crabbit called out and I stirred from where I had been staring out into the sunny day. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2IyMDQxNDkzMTQxMTA4MWZiNjJlMGNjMjkxNmE2"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NDA3ZDFhMzAzMzRhZTI5NTgwMzZhYjFmNjk3NWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go ahead and patch it through. Let’s find out what they want.” I said, perhaps a little darkly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWZjZThjOWExMjRjZTRiZjc0NGVkNTM3ZWZiOGNl"> </p>
<p class="cnM1M2JkZmVhNzNjYTRjMzA4MGJmYmU1NDEzYzE4OTMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh. Captain Katherine, you uh, there?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m here.” I said, a bite to my tone that I could hear made it through as there was an audible silence on the line.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDVhZDIzMThmZTQ3ZmNiOWIwNDg1MTkwMjQ5N2I3"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZTAxYzVlZjhjZDRhNDc5ZTQwYjEyZDQ4ZTNmNTc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. Forgive me Captain, that was… Not the side of Stark Point I wanted to share. I’ve managed to settle the issue with the Hauler, we are just… Waiting on your leave to retrieve the cargo.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll open the doors then. I’ll be keeping an eye on things and won’t be joining you physically. I think you understand.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. I apologize, Captain. I understand. I’ll ensure the cargo is offloaded swiftly.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzQ5ZmUzMDJmZTQyN2Q4YjNiOGZmZDU2NGY0ZmEw"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YzVkZTQ3YmRmMDRjODFhN2FkOGViZmEwZTU3ZThm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I considered responding but instead just hit the button on my Tab ending the call.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDVlMGM0YjIxNDQzYTI4ZmNkMWI0OTdmZjU3YTE2"> </p>
<p class="cnM0OTdmMDI0MTczYTQ2YTliNjI0NjA2MmUzZWI4MzIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Open the bay doors, and keep an eye out. I want to make sure no one gets any bright ideas about stealing anything.” I told the Crabbits who cheered and waved their arms at my orders. To them this was just a fun game. To me, it was… Bitter. So much for a fun adventure.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWI5MjViNTUzMTQzMTI5NGI0YTFhMzFiNzI5OWY1"> </p>
<p class="cnM2N2Y0NjkxODZiZDQ1N2JhNGU0NzUxZTk3ZjNkNDQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I pushed the Tab and accessed the feeds some of the Crabbits hiding in the hold were sending. There wasn’t much in the hold that could be taken easily, but it could still be taken, and I was no longer giving this planet the benefit of the doubt.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmZhY2FiYjczZTRjZjRiNTZkMmM1ZGYzODJmMjc1"> </p>
<p class="cnNkOWEwMDJlYTIzNTRmMWVhZmM4MTE3Nzk0MzE3NmI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I settled in, watching as the people brought the floating hauler up the now descended ramp. The boy that was driving wasn't the one that threatened me. Instead he was a much younger boy who guided the hauler up carefully, as a few men swarmed the container. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTY2ZjIwOWUyODRhYWU5Yjc0MjVkZWQ2ZTA0ZTNi"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZmM1ZTE2NzI5NzRkMjA4YjViOWRhMGYyMjlmYjM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Releasing the locks, the Hauler moved in, and took the first container slowly backing it out, and then away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmMxNmJkM2YwNzRkNjM4NjIzYzhjYWFiZmE2M2Yx"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NjFjMjA2YzA3MTQ5NDZhNGRkYWY4NjY3OWUzYzJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Looks like they had a place for it all, but it meant a longer wait on my side.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDdhZjE5Y2ExYjRlMTk5MzBjMWUzNzg4MmE3Mjlm"> </p>
<p class="cnNhY2MyYjhhZmJhZDQ3YjZiMzZhYWM1ODY5N2I3MGM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed as I just kept watching. The fun of delivering out into the far frontier of humanity having lost a lot of its luster.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2I0NjIwZDZjMTQ4NTBhODQyYzE2ODQyNjg5NDFl"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MTQ3Y2Y0YTMxYTQ2YmU5YzI4ZmIyNzc2Y2Y1OWI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Next job would be more normal, I decided.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGM1MTcxMjc0YjQ5ZGM5YjcwNzYzNzc3YjRlMWRm"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMzZmMjFjODQxMDQzZWNiYTdjMmNjMDhhMDQzYmQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjkxZmVjOWU0YzRlMWRhZjdmNDI2YmVhODA3N2I1"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MTAyOWU2MDI2ZDRkMjM5M2VlMDc1MGM1YWYyMjVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the hold was empty, I closed the door, and made ready to leave. Of course before I could actually jump I got another comm message. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjM5MjExODBjMjQ3NDViNTAwYmNkNmRhNzRmYmE1"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NGMwZGFlMjM5ODQ0M2Y5ZjZkZWIwYzAxMzczNDgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is Phantom Star.” I said, bluntly, and this time the response wasn’t cowed. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZThkOWU5YWFlNDQzZDdhNDk0ZTk1NWVjNmIxZjEy"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDM0NDRjYjE5OTRjOTNiNWUwODVhYTAwOTVjOTk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you Captain, for coming out here, these supplies were desperately needed. I understand your position, and I know you will leave soon. If… If it isn’t too much, we do have messages, we’d like to be sent to the net?” Stark asked, speaking carefully.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWRiODI5MDQzOTQzMzFhZTlhMjg4MzhkNjVmMTdi"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ODU4NjI4MmMwYjQ3NGY5YzcyNjc1ZTdhYmNlNmJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll deliver them.” I pointed at the Crabbit on communications and it wiggled as it started partitioning out some space for it. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGRmYzZjMWU1NTQwOGFhMGYxMWQ0MDYwMjBmNmMx"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you Captain. I’ve left an… Apology, although it hardly matches the crime, in your hold.” I blinked because I hadn’t actually noticed that.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTNlODlhYTg3NDQ3Mzg4YTIzZWYwN2FjNTA3OGFi"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZDBiZmEzYmQzZjQ1YjBhYWFmMDcwMmMxMjMyMzkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll take a look.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well. I wish you luck in the verse. Maybe we’ll see each other again.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Doubtful.” I said firmly, because I was never coming to this place again.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzEwNjZiMTNhOTQ5NTU4MGViNmY0N2Y1MzJjNzhi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNGY5ZDU1N2RjZjQ4Njk5MWU3ODg5NjQ1YjQ3ZjFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Farewell then.” He offered, sounding weary. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDI3ZjAxMjU2ZDQ1OTdhNDk5ODJjNzFjYmY2MmZj"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYzdhYjhiZTdkMzRkNDNiYjRmYWNjNTY1NGJiYzcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The comm line ended, and I quickly started prepping for liftoff, no way did I want to be here any longer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did they leave in the hold?” I asked, and the Crabbit all seemed to humm a bit, obviously sharing the data with the ones in the hold. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWI3M2I0MDg1MDQ1MDU5ZjRlM2Y0MWVkNDlkZDQ3"> </p>

<p class="cnNlYjRjYjk2YTllNTRkMGJiOWM5NjZkZGIwZWM5N2Q5"><span style="font-weight: 400">It’d probably be like holding onto a firehose. I didn’t really want to be launched around the room, as the output of the emitter tried to move me. So it would have to have a stabilizer…</span></p>

<p class="cnNkMzA0OWIwZDZjOTQyMjlhYjIwMjRjYWQ1ZTg0MzE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">There were plenty of mentions of the technology, but nothing on the net I could find about setting up personal shields, or the tech needed.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmYmIxNDJlMzk3OTQyYzc5M2QyZTE5MzI0MjY5ZjBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess I should have expected that, but at least I had looked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjMzNTMzOTAwODQxZDNiMTY1NTRhYTAwMTE0MmU4"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NzY1YzgwNTY0ODRiZTQ4NDViOTc2N2QyMmNlNjkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Glancing at the response I frowned a little. I had been hired, but the conditions on the supplies being transported were a little tight. Nothing I couldn’t do. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDdkYmFiNTBjOTQ0ODlhODJkNjQ3YThiZTQxNzg5"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZGVlZTE3ODk4YjRlYTdhOTExNzU2ZWU5MWNlZDky"><span style="font-weight: 400">I read through all the conditions and in the end just shrugged. Most of that was standard stuff anyway. So I sent off an acknowledgement and a general time frame of my arrival to Vickers.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1MzhiNjFiNGU5NDRmZmQ5YmIxYWE4MTU5Y2RkMTJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I logged out of the net and headed out of the Comm room. I stopped on the docking ring, I could still see the Phantom, but down the way I could also hear the sound of spacers having a good time in a bar. I considered heading in, meeting new people, maybe finding a crewmember?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDdkNDZkNWVkYTQwMDY4NmNkYmJiYWJjZjYwYTY3"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NzFjODVhM2VlZDRjNmQ5MjQ5YmRiNmZhZDU5YzI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">My boots took me back to the Phantom, and I was undocking not long after. I just… Wanted some peace and quiet for a while.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwZTFkMzRiOTc4ZTQ1MTVhMTQ1NjkxZjgxYjA5MTY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vickers was an interesting system. Not an industrial hub, or a total Frontier like Starks Point. It was more like a mid system. One that had grown out of being a frontier, and was becoming a burgeoning population world.</span></p>

The one most populated and rich.</span></p>

There were no massive skyscrapers, instead, the star port was just a massive flat area, with a large building connecting all the star docks together. As I flew in I could actually see another big freighter belch plasma as it lifted off, and started its slow ascent.</span></p>

I popped open the hold doors, and breathed a sigh of relief. There wasn’t a bad smell on this planet. I had suspected there wouldn’t, but you never know. Instead I stepped out into the sun peaking through the cloudy sky.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2MwNTZmMmQwOTQ0NzE4YTI2YmUzMzZmZmY2MTJi"> </p>

<p class="cnMwMTMzZDc3MjkwZDRhZTNiZGEzNmJmMTYxOWE2Y2Rk"> </p>
<p class="cnMzOTQ4NmU0NmFjODQ3YTI5NGJlYTFiNTdmY2I4MmVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up and wiped myself down, I looked clean enough, even adjusted my jumpsuit so I was wearing it and didn’t just have it tied to my waist to look more presentable. </span></p>

<p class="cnNkY2I0ZDAxZmI5NDRkODFiZGE5YjQ4ZGUyOGY1MDNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the truck approached, I blinked because there was a smaller hover car behind it. I only took a single glance to tell it was fancy and expensive.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTdhMGRkMzRlNzQ4MTdhMzM1ZTMzYzBiZmM0N2M2"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YzdkMmE4YTUxMjQzNWY4NWQ1ZjhhODIyMzBhNTA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">They both pulled up and it didn’t take long until the driver of the hover car stepped out, a man wearing the equivalent to a suit. Although the weird fact it was all in one piece was a bit odd.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWFhODAyMDk5MTQ0MGFhYjZiNTBlN2NiZWI0ZjNk"> </p>
<p class="cnNiN2UxNWI0YzA0YjRjOTU4MDAyOWYyNTYwNGMxNGVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again I ran around in a jumpsuit so I shouldn’t throw rocks in my glass house.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4M2VmNzE1MTA0YTRlYTY5ODljNGI0N2JjMWZlOGVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The driver opened the door and out stepped another man who looked around before seeing me, and stepping forward quickly. The man was obviously in a rush and he approached quickly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGM2ODBiNWVkMzRjNWViN2M3NjMxZjJmYzU4YjBj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZDcxZDNiNjdmNjQ3MzRiZWJlMjIwNmNiNDA3ODQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m looking for Captain Katherine? Of the Phantom Star?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s me.” I greeted back and he blinked and seemed a bit bewildered for a moment, before his face fell into an easy casual smile as he threw a hand to his chest and then splayed it out.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWIzZGZmZWE0ZDQ1YjJhMmU1M2FhODY2M2RlNjBl"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNDMyYzUwYjFhNDRhNDM5YTk1NjRjY2Y2M2FkOGMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t anything I recognized. A planetary gesture? Or maybe even a weird Kenish thing? </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTRmMDk5MDlkMDQwN2Q5NTU4ZjZmNzRlOTMxNzkx"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Forgive me, I don’t know what I was expecting. I am Ian Kettermen, I wanted to thank you for taking on my package and being so prompt about it! Time is of the essence.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well I’ll be taking off and heading directly to the drop off, the moment we’re done here.” I offered back to him, and his smile shifted into something more real for a moment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent! Truly Captain you are a ray of starlight. Shall my men load it now?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now is great.” I waved at the hold and Ian turned and waved at the truck which instantly moved forward a bit and started backing up into the Phantom Star.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2E1Y2Y2OWQ0OTRhMTZiOGNjNDVkNjk5MjA3ZTYw"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMzFiMjIyMjZkNjRlMThhMzljYmQzNTY5NDU5OTA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was interesting to see what this planet must consider as normal for a large hauler like this. The truck was a weird almost triangle shaped cab, and the package itself was a large container. Sealed and locked down like it was supposed to be.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YThmMzVkZDY4YTQyMTQ5OTNjM2IzNWU1YmM2OGFk"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMWI1Nzg3MWYzNjQwYjg5NzVjYzcxNjA2MGY2MTYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">So I did the correct thing and didn’t ask about what was in it. The Guild would have checked to make sure it wasn’t anything dangerous, and so it wasn’t my business. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmY5NzJjM2U5MTRjZDA4NzliZDdjMzkwZGNlNzlj"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZGRhYTZiNzhmNTRiMWNhOThlOGZmODE4MjNhMTQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A beautiful ship, when I received your offer I only had the metrics from the guild, I didn’t realize my package would be so well protected!” He offered suddenly, and I tore my eyes away from the truck as it was settling the container in the hold. It had an interesting function as it sort of split apart to drop the container off.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2EyMmUzOWZiYjQ0ZGU5NTUyYjk4M2I0M2NiOTFl"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYzJkZDY1ZmM3MjRlMmZhNjZkZDE1ZGJjMTQ3MDJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a dangerous galaxy. I just make sure I’m well defended.” I said, earning another smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTNkZGMxMDcwYzRjMjk5MTcxNTM3Y2Y5NTc1ZTVi"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good good! You shouldn’t have any issues, it’s always good to have a big gun involved! Haha!” The man offered and I nodded along. Ian seemed the type to just never stop talking. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWNjNzYxNmNmYzQxYTA4YzMzN2I2MzI3NWNiNWQ2"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMzhlM2Q3NmNiYjQ4Nzc5NGJmNmQ5MDM3N2U3N2Ni"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally the truck pulled away, the package was dropped off, and I would secure it shortly. “Alright, that’s that then. I’ll be heading off immediately.” I cut in, interrupting the man's discussion about the safety of travel routes and things he had dealt with in the past. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjJiODQ3ZGE5YzRmOWY5YzEyNjUwYmVkZTdkNGM4"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NDhlOGE0MWMyYzRmOTI5N2NhMDU0NTY5ZjFjYWFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t a system trucker, I would be jumping to warp so it wasn’t really important.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTI3YTA2YjZlMDQzNmViNmRlZDg1ZDM2NDkxYWEw"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Of course! Quick travels Captain! Quick Travels!” He cheered as he hurried off the ramp and I hit the close.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWE3Mzk5YzVmODRhNjhhNjY2ZDJjMzk2NGI5YjAw"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZDU4ZTE3MDIyODQ2YjZiODQ4ODBiOTYzOTNmYjc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Time to get this container secured, and then get out of here.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwNmFiMTI3MzY0ZTQwYWY5YjdkZTM5MjVlZWY0YjIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay try it now?” I asked, looking over at the Crabbits that were helping me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTQ4YzFmMzEwZTQzMTFhOTBhY2UzOGMxNDdhNjNk"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NDI0MGVjNDUxYTQxNWNhNWNiYmJiNzJmYjZmYTA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooh!

<p class="cnM1YWM3ZWI3OTc0NTRhMGI5MzY1ZmU1YzhkYThhMWM2"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYWVkODU5MjQwYjQ4NmU4YjJhNzZlNWZlOWM3MDU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer had come to me rather quickly when I realized I was overthinking things. A personal shield emitter was going to be a long term project. I would need to make equipment, to make the equipment so to speak to even hope to get to that point.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmZiNDEzZWI5NjQ2ZGY5ZmQxODcyNWMxN2YyODNi"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOTgzMDgwNDc5ZjQ5NjViYjdkYjIxYzNmMzk4OWVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">So I changed my approach. That could be put on the back burner for now, because right now I needed function, better than form.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTBhN2JhY2VlZjQ0MzRhMmFjMmI3MmUwYWY1ZDFm"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NTA0NjEwMTAxZTQyYzQ4ZDg4MzVmZjNjNDM0NTRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been planning on making some modules for the Crabbits anyways, so rather than a personal shield, I decided to see what I could do with a Crabbit shield.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzkxZWE4NDBlNzQ4ZTQ5NTViYjY4NDlkNzU5YzY5"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZmI0NjI1MWNmMzQ0NTFhOWExMWMzMWRjYTYxZjBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was just a testing version. Four Crabbits grabbing onto each other, forming a square floating in the air. A series of emitters connected together, and what should be enough power between the four of them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjczYTRlMDQyNjRiMmNiMTk2MGMxNWQ0NWU3M2Y0"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNzMxZjZmZjY0NjQxZDQ5NGIwMTkwZmY4ZWY5ZWU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I ducked down as the air crackled a bit, and I looked up to see all of them strewn across the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGJlNzQxMWFiNDRhZmRiMzM4YTYyZWI2MGQ2OThh"> </p>
<p class="cnM3M2M1MWUzYjc2ZjQxNjY4NWM0MGNiZTkzOTljZmI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2U1MTE2MWFhYTQxYzY5ODE3YTdjMWRiNDJlYWVl"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZWE4ODQ4MjE5MDRlYmZiMjc3MGI5YjZhMWViNDQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehehehe!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTE4NjNmMDg5ZjQ4NzY4ZjVjMmZjMjcyMjBhOTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look I’m stuck!” They chattered away, each of them responding differently. I stood up and walked over. Distangling one that had gotten wedged in my tool bench, and then checking on the one that had expressed pain.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmZjZjRlYjQ3NDRiMjJhNWZiMmFkNTM0NDcyN2Iz"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMDYxYTNhMDE5NzQ4MjM5YmFmOTVhYTk4NmZlMzM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu. Dent.” It whined at me, poking the top of its chassis that did in fact have a little dent. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjQwNjJlYmYyNzQ5M2JhOTFkODQzYjk0NWQwMTcz"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll pop that right out, c’mon. Good work everyone! I'll still need to make some adjustments.” I told them and got chipper responses. The four bounced back from the emitter sending them flying away nearly instantly now that I had checked on them. Kids.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzODZhYmY3MDc4NDQzNjg4M2YwYzY0OWQ2NjQwMmMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrival into the new system was as always a breath of fresh air as we emerged into real space. Star-like lights that didn’t move or shift, or grow or shrink met my eyes and that was a relief from the constant weirdness of subspace.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmQxZDkzMTg5OTRiODQ5Y2Y0NzI2ZmM0OWM3NTUx"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZTY3NmZmNDNhOTQ3OTlhODJmMjIzYzFiYTU4ZTZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I flicked my Tab to open the Comm channel, and broadcast my basic information, as I started shifting the Phantom towards my goal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2U5MmU3MWUxNzQ1ZTJhZDdlMGQ1M2ZhODVhOTQ2"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ODAyM2I0MDhhZDQ3Y2Q5OTQ1NzU0MWU0ZGE1N2M4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The station was near one of the main planets in the system. My sensor net was already picking up the system traffic, filling the sensor display with all the ships flying around.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmI4M2EyOTdjMDQ1MGI5NTJiZjcyZWY4YjI0NjNh"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YzdlODJlMGU0NzRiYThhNDFlMmZlOWY1NjI1ZDll"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a busy system. Lots of ships flying in and out but none of that was my concern. I received an automated message soon enough once the station understood I was here for a delivery, and soon I was backed up to the station and locked in place to begin handing off the cargo.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDhmMTM4YjM4MjQ5MDg4OGU4ZDVlZGNiZTYxMDk2"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMWI1ODg5YjdmZDRlZjU5NzBlMzBlN2FjYzJjYjYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I spent a bit of time making sure everything was in order before deciding I should stretch my legs a bit. I ended up passing through the quiet cargo hold, and then up the personnel elevator to the Hab level.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODA0ZDU2YzI0ZjQyNjQ4YjkyYjAwZWVhZmI0NmMw"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YTkzYTRlNjU4MzRiMzM5NjM1YzAwZmY3NDU4Mjc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately while most stations have some sort of Hab area, to walk around and get some sunlight for spacers, this one was…</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDkyNzlhMWU4OTQyNWNiOTllOGVkYzJhMWNhZjRk"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NjA0YTZmODA2OTQwYmJhZGExYzc0OTRlNGRmMTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmM0YTc5MzBkNTQ4MjRiMjczZjU5NDk1YmZhZTZi"> </p>

I stepped out looking around a little scared I had gotten out at the wrong level, when a sign flashed off across the way in the center of the Hab area. </span></p>

I found myself standing in the door for a moment taking it in. The server woman going around dropping off massive beers to one of the two tables that were full of spacers sitting and relaxing. Men at the bar, and of course a bartender, it all felt normal despite being so far into the future.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzY2U2MDMzMWVjMzRmZTI5NDI2MmNmYTY3ZTA0YTFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwODM0YzhkZTFkYzQyZjk4NjliMmI3Njc1ZWM0MGQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a crew now, and he was joining me because he had info on pirates… Pirates that he expected me to hunt down…</span></p>

<p class="cnM5OWEyNmM4N2M5OTRiMjA4MjhiMmMxNmE0M2U1ZWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuck, had I just accepted that!? </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGY1YmI4NGNhYzRjNjRhM2FlNzNlMjhhNzFiZTM2"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MzJkODIzN2JiZDQ2ZWE4Y2MzNjc1ODM2OGRmMDM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I wiped the nervousness from my face with a breath and then pointed down the paths out of the mess. “So that way is the engine room, and some supply rooms. Engine room is strictly off limits. Supply rooms are open, one of them is my workshop, try not to grab anything without talking to me first. Those halls are the crew quarters, I figure we’ll start on starboard-”</span></p>

<p class="cnNjM2RkMDcwZDQxYTQ0YjM4YjUxZWRiYzQ0ZTJhOGJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short tour, Hammond picked one of the rooms, and I had the Crabbits bring up one of the sleeping pods that Marie, Marshall, Collin, and Carter had used. While he headed back off the ship to collect his things.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDJiMmQ0OGRlNjQxYzNhMDA1ZjE5OThkODRmMWMy"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNWYxNTU0ZDk2YzQyN2FhY2I4NGViYmU1NDc1ZmEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then even as the Crabbits buzzed around attracted to the new person in their space I headed up to the bridge which was thankfully quiet.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzMjVlMWQxYjI1MDQ4MTQ4NzA4Nzg1Yzc3ZmFmOGU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I sat in my chair and stared out at the stars trying to figure out the emotions I was feeling.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1NjFkNmE1YzI3MzQ3NmE5MDZhYjY5YzNiMWEyN2Q0"><span style="font-weight: 400">That… It had been a spur of the moment choice. To accept a crewmate. To even slightly accept that I would be hunting pirates next. I didn’t…</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTU2YTIxMDNkOTQxYjQ5YzJiMGYxMmQ3YWQ4Mjg5"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZWZjZTA2ZDkwYjQ0NGNhOWVkMWQwMWI2NjQxNGE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Did I want to do that? I could make plenty of money just doing transport. Happy and safe with that.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4OTU4OTQ3MTQzZjQyZGVhN2Y0OWYzMTNlMGE5NGU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">But… That feeling in my stomach. I wanted this. When had I chosen the safe choice? I could have lived safe and happy on station for the rest of my life as well, if I wanted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjcxMDk0Y2NkMzRjOTM4MDg0OTgwNTg4NWVkOTI1"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZjdjNTg5Zjk5MjQ4Mjc4OGY2ZTUwN2RkMWU5Nzc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had made a choice while fighting those pirates so long ago, not to be afraid, and not to be a coward.</span></p>

<p class="cnM0OWRiZGUxOTA5MTQyMTM5NWViMzE0MzUwM2JiZTZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had power. A ship that was strong, and unique. One I had built with my own hands. The Phantom Star wasn’t built to transport goods across the stars. It was built to transport my dream.</span></p>

<p class="cnM0NzhjNjU0NDE0NDQ2YTdhYzBjMzMyMGQ2OWZhNmIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, that dream was pirate hunter.</span></p>

<p class="cnNiMjFkMWRkOGJiNTQzMjJhMWUyOTUwNmU0ZGE1M2Qz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I checked my ship's status. I was still down to just my Thermal Lance. It was time to do some upgrades. I could use the time to get used to Hammond, and the both of us would probably do with a station right there, in case something goes wrong, and we don’t mesh well.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1OWI2MmI3YmQ1OTQ5NDc4MjJiOWEwMzA1M2MxNDNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was good, right? There weren't any hanging wires, or open pits anymore!</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGZhOWM2NjU4MzQ4OGRhOTA2NTIxOWViY2VkNzJj"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NDY0NDRiOGFhZjQyY2RhYTM1Yjk1MWQ1YjQxYzJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right? I quickly ran my ship through my head. No… It should be okay? Right? I mean… The elevator still didn’t work, and the ship was sort of empty looking since I hadn’t really tried to fix it  up, I didn’t even have enough chairs… </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTY3MTllZTg2ZDQ0OTE5NWFhMjJiOGZhMThkMWVh"> </p>
<p class="cnMxN2QzOTliMDcxNTQxNzBhNmQ2ODUxY2MxMjhhYmQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly pulled out my Tab and sent a request to the Nanoforge Crabbit to make a second chair for the mess. I’d need a table too. Should I make one, or look around on station to see if they had one?</span></p>

<p class="cnM3ZDcxYzAxNGY4ODQ1YWQ4Yjk0ZmYwZDY3YmMyNTIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The thoughts ran through my mind, as I was getting stressed about it. That desire in my breast to be perfect, but always feeling like I was just not good enough eating at me.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4YTRkZWUzZTAwMjQwNDlhMDc1YTVkZWE0ZGNmZmI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a breath and exhaled. </span></p>

<p class="cnM1ZjJiODZjODczOTRhY2NhZDM5OTA2ZGI1OGFhZTVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hammond gone from the ship meant I had time to have a private conversation with my other crewmates. I gathered all the Crabbits onto the bridge and started the meeting.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzY3NGEyN2ViZDQyYzNhNmZkNmUwYmI5MWIzZDcz"> </p>
<p class="cnNjODBkMDY3ODU0MTRiMjJhODIzODE4ODM5MzAzMTIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So Hammond is going to join us for at least a little while as part of the crew.” I explained to the gaggle of Crabbits hovering and hanging around me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm.” The Crabbit said as she rubbed at her chin. “Information needed.” They finally responded in fits and spurts among them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTcxZjc3ZDAzZTQyZTM4OGMyOTM5NzJkYTY5MDU5"> </p>
<p class="cnMwN2VlODliOThmNTQ3ZTNhMDlkZTAzZGM2ZDI0MzY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t have all of it yet. So while we still want to keep him out of any red zones, he’s allowed to enter and leave the ship. We should still keep an eye on him though. He’s new, so we want to make sure he isn’t doing something scary like… Planting a bomb or something.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh scary!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDVkZDc1ZDUzMTQ5ODViYTNkNThlMzI2ZDcyMDYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe. I like bombs!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGVmMzJiZjE2ZDRmZDQ4NTI0ZmYzY2U2YzkzYzdm"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMmMyNzYyZWI5NDQ4OTNhZDg3OTI2OTk0ZDc5MzNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tactical.” I grumbled at that particular Crabbit. But it only continued to giggle sinisterly. “Alright. So he’s going to be with us, but he isn’t like Marie, or the others. We’re going to figure out what working with someone is like, so mistakes might happen. So I want everyone to be careful about what they learn from him. If you are curious about something, ask me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it! We got it! New crewmate added!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWU4Y2FkMjZkNTQ0YzQ4OGExMWRkYjNjYmQ4OWJj"> </p>
<p class="cnMzODFjZDlmNzUxNDRlMzY5ZmY2MTk0M2E3YzNkZjVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh oh! Captain! Captain! I have a question!” One of the Crabbits called out bouncing among the floating horde.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTc4ZDY4MjM0YTQ2YWNiNjBlZTFhN2IwMWY2MWYz"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does he play hide and seek?” She asked and that caused an eruption as all of them started chattering about it as well, wondering if he was better at it than me, or worse.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmM4OGFjMTQyZTRiMWJiZWQ1NjZkMDVlMzEyNjVj"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YWI1YTRiZmVmNTQ3OGY5MjJiNTc4YmYzMTI0MTNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I just felt my shoulders relax as they chattered away to each other. In their minds this was no big change. Just something new, maybe something fun, but not something to be anxious about. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDZkNGFlMDA5OTRjNTVhOTNmZjc1MzI1ZDc3NjI3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMTJiZGY5MzAwZTQzNTY5MmNjZjJhNmZiOTA3YTZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">They couldn’t even feel anxiety. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWM1MDU2MDM4YzQ3MDc4ZDhiOGJiMzRjNTQwOTgw"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYzkxYTZiNDM0MDQyZDI4NzRkYTQ0ZmRkMGE4MGE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were happy to find out what it would be like.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWY4ODgzNGNmMDRjM2I4ZjJlYTEyNmM1YmUwZDMx"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">So I would be happy to find out as well.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDVkNjFmZDk5YjRkOWI4NDEyYmVmMzkzODliNGFh"> </p>
<p class="cnNiM2VhM2ZkNTg5ZTRlMjc4MGE2YmYxYzRmNWM4ODJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh! Right, should get the lasers installed while we’re here. So let’s get that sorted! Back to work!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aww, I wanted to play Hide and Seek.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGViNmQ2NjM1ZDRlOTQ4YWI3MTU0Y2FiZTU4OGE5"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNzllMDZhZjFjMDQzZTE5OTZmZGYxMzBlZWNhMWJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I promise we’ll play later.” </span></p>

<p class="cnM3Nzk3N2RjN2EwYzQzODE4MzAyZTg1OGNiZDBkNzYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was moving the laser arrays up from the hold to the two rooms one each side of the ship where they would be maintained, even as the Crabbits started the process of eating away at the armor with Nanopaste to create the slots the lasers would shoot from.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzkzOGVhMjA3MjQ4NThhZmQxZDFjMzA3ODg5NDYy"> </p>
<p class="cnNhODM4N2Y0OTFiNzQyNjJhZjdiNmI0NTgxOTVhMTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rooms each had a forcefield set up at the door to keep the air from escaping once the hull was cut through, and I was just walking through the mess when a noise had me look up and see Hammond entering the mess with a large bag over his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWU4Y2E0MmE2ZDQ1Yjg4MGJkNGIyZTMwZTZmMDYy"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YjM1ZmRkNTUwZDQxYTZhMjJlOGJiZDc5YmM1NGNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a sudden shock in my hindbrain. The sense of someone being here in my private space was WRONG.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjE1N2NkZmQwYTRkZmM4NTZkYTE4NmM2Y2JhM2Yz"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YzBmNDA0YWFkYzQzZmQ4MWE3ODM3MTk1MTZkYThl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I yelped, and jumped a bit as I flailed and almost ate shit as I was so surprised I fell backwards a bit.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzI4MWJhYzczNTRkOWI5N2RkNTcxYjVhZDI0YjQ5"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMjdkYjYzMTQ5NzRhODZiYTMxOTY1YmViOGI2N2Qx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hammond stopped, and stared, and I stopped and stared back.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDVkMGRmYzIzODQ2MWY4MGFkOTU4YWVlMzQ3NzEx"> </p>
<p class="cnMxN2M0ZjhjODM2YTQ4ZDdhYjNhM2FmMjAyZmQ3ZmY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine! You just surprised me!” I said instantly laughing it off even as I felt my face heat up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjEzNWY4ZDk0MzQzY2E4OTU3MmY1YzE2MzY3ZmZj"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Jeez I knew he would be around!</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDAzNTJjZjNkNTQ2NmE5YjIzMzYxOTM5YzJhMzMx"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOGQyNzJhMDUwZjQ2Njc5ZjE2NjJlNTBkNGFhMGMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lasers?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Oh yeah. If we’re fighting pirates I need to get these installed.” I said pointing at the floating array that the Crabbit were lifting through the ship. Three of them were working together on each one, front on top, and the back to make sure it didn’t get damaged.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDUwNTlhNjQ0ODRiOTQ4NjMzMzM5Mjk4N2IwY2Vk"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZmZjODAxZTlhNTQ0YzZiODE2ZjY5YzdhNDIyZGZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I’m pretty sure the one on top was just giggling because she was enjoying the ride rather than doing anything helpful.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzkyZDQ3OGYzMTQ4ZDk4ZjcyMDlmMmMxYjgxMWMx"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZjg1MzdmYjNhNzQzYmM5MTY0MzJlYWJjYzFlNzVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked from me to the lasers, to the Crabbits and finally spoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTNlNDkwNTM5NTRmNzNiMTkyOGY4N2U1MjdkNDc3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZjNjMDNiZmRmODRlNWJhYzdlMGIyYjEyNGRiMDIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure got a lot of those drones.” He muttered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. The Crabbits are… important. They handle a lot of things I can't do by myself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked them over just as they were looking him over and he shrugged. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGFiYjhjMDZiOTQ5ZTlhNjQwMmMxZDAyZjVhMzU3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMjg4Y2ZhOTcwZTRiZDA4MWNhNmYwM2YyOTg4Y2Fl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Need a hand? Not much of an engineer, but I know how to hold a Mag wrench.” He asked, I hesitated at the surprise offer. I wobbled a bit on each foot as I considered it. I took a breath in and out, then nodded. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjczZTkxOTg1YzRjZWNiOWM5OTRiOWYyOGFmNzNh"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNGU5YmIxNmM1ZDQ3Nzk4NDc1NmRlYTE0MmJlZTVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, if you want. I could use some help installing everything.” I decided and he nodded his massive head and followed after me as I led the trail of Crabbits and Lasers to the room. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTdmZTIzMWUwNDRhZDNhNDNlZjc1NDI1ZjA5MGUx"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZmM4YzkxOGVmNDQ0ZDA5M2QwM2QyMDYwNDcxZjJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I moved in and helped guide the Crabbits inside only to realize something just as Hammond was about to walk in.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTFlMWE2MmQzNjQyNDk4NDIwZjMwMThmZTI3ZDhh"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait!” I called out, but my voice didn’t go anywhere, because the entire room was now in vacuum. I rushed forward and slammed into him just before he stepped through the door. My hand barely slowed him, and it was more surprise than any actual force that caused him to back up a few steps and I followed. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjIyYzkzOTJjODQ5ZTNhNjU3OTc5YzIyZTZhZTE2"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMzQ4MWI2ZjJkOTRmNTI5YjAxNWI3MjA5OTViM2I5"><span style="font-weight: 400">My helm forcefield turned off as I stepped into the atmosphere, and I was able to speak again. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTI1ZDIyYjJlMTQ0OTI4OTE3MmVmOTdkZjVlZDAx"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YWJjYTdkNDZlYjRhNGM5MDEzZDBmYmNkZGM2ZDI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry! Sorry! You okay?” I asked a little frantic as I looked from his face to make sure he wasn’t stuck in vacuum, to his chest to make sure my push hadn’t hurt him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmE3ODc4YzYxYzQ1NGY4ZDRmM2YxYzY2ZDY1MTVj"> </p>
<p class="cnMwODc5OGZhM2I5ZDQ4NzJhYzkyYjBiMWE0NjUwM2Zh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine. What was tha-? Ah, forcefield.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Sorry I forgot, I had to cut through the hull to install the lasers, and that was already done, so the room is in vacuum. Do you have a forcefield? I should have asked first, but I wasn’t thinking, and I almost just had you walk into a vacuum!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey. Relax kid. Err, I mean Captain.” He corrected himself. His voice had shifted to very amused before realizing what he had said. “I’ve got a forcefield emitter too.” He confirmed and I felt myself relax. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjZiYTBhMTZjMzQ0Y2U4MmNkNWMwMDAyNTg2ODdk"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YTg5NzdlYWYyYjRlY2JiMTdhMWRmYmY3MjBhNzJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Good! Good. Sending my first crewmate into a vacuum on accident wouldn’t be something I could ever live down.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzNjNmFjNjg2YzQ4NDc5M2YyMDdjMDhmMzE4Yjhk"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MjRkNDU0ODEwNTRmZWQ5MDQxNzdhMzU1ZTM5OTRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled back and he followed me into the room, as the Crabbits were already positioning the lasers. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTFmMzU4OGRmNjRhNjlhYTY0OTRjZGRmOTRjMTc4"> </p>

<p class="cnM3YjQwY2MyZmY1ZDQxMTk5Y2Y3NWFmY2IwMDVjYzE0"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMWNhY2FkMWE5YTQ4YmZiZmQzNDA2ZjZmYWUyYzcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged. It was whatever.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTY1ZTUxYzBmYzQ5ZDhhYjcxOTE0MmVlZDA0OWIw"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZTA5Zjg0MTVmNDQ4Mzg4NzNmYjgxY2Q0YmFiMGQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What made you go into space?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Work. Homeworld’s just a dustball. Grew up on a farm, nothing to see or do. Ship stopped off, and I walked up to the captain. Got a lift off world. Signed up with the Navy not long after. Got my mods, the rest is history.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at that, as we both ate. We were sort of feeling eachother out. Offering bits of our backstory and just… Getting to know one another. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2IyZmY3YjEyYzQ5ZDdhN2E4YWY3YmRmMzVjZmRj"> </p>
<p class="cnM1N2NiZTE5NTFiZTQwZWFhZmFhYjMxZDkxMTE2YWNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ever been back?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. Not in a long time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. I plan on going home from time to time, but that’s me I guess. Any family or anything?” I asked, and for the first time he didn’t answer my question. Just continued tearing into his steak.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWIzMjk2MDE0YTQyNzZiOWE5MDVjMDgyN2RiYTAw"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMDZmOWQyNzk4NzQyMWFhYzE0MjA5ZWZiZWY5NzU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjFkYmEzZjJhODQxYzU4ZTAzODI4YjI5ZWI2NDg3"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OTU0MzNiYjgwMjRhYjNhMzY0MjExZTNkMDliMWFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was obviously a sensitive topic. I dropped it, and instead changed the subject. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDJmMmI4ZDk1NjRmZTA4ZTQ1MTcwYTgxZDQ4NGM0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5OTM3OGE1MzA1YjQzOWU5NTg5ZTA0ZTI0MTZkOWEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well if you stick around long enough, you’ll get to see UNK-L at some point. I’ll head back for a visit or something now and again.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGUwOWE1MTA1NTQ4YWU4MjliODYwNTIwMDRkYjZh"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. Home being a station seems a bit weird to me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s not. The Phantom Star is my home.” I offered, looking around the room fondly. I’d made this. It still struck me how amazing it was to be in a spaceship I had made with my own hands. A ship that would take me among the stars. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWYzMjg3MTdjZjQzOGM5ODI4MjBiMmI1ODc0ZTI1"> </p>
<p class="cnM1Yzg4M2U0ZDg2ZTQ0Y2Y4YWQwYzc2NGM1ZGEwNWNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm.” He offered back, Hammond was a man of few words at times. “How long until we head out Captain?” He asked, and the pointed use of my title had my back straightening a bit in happiness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzQ3ZjIyNGUzNzQzMDBhNzVkOGQxODZiNjZlODM0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkM2FkOGU5ZTFhNzQ3NmM4MmRlZmVhZGVmZjM2Mjkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh we can head out soon. I just want to finish the laser installation. Once the panels are installed and hooked up we’re good.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good. We’ll need to land on Vel Kata. Got a contact there that’s been keeping an eye out for the pirates. Should have some information for me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Vel Kata, got it.” I offered, pulling up my Tab and double checking everything. Hmm. That was about a two day jump from here. Not bad at all. I dropped my Tab back into my pocket and grabbed my food and started inhaling. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2I4ZTc1M2MzNjQzMjE5OGRmZjJiYTdjMzg3NzVi"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YTYyNmZlY2M3NTQ1MGE4Njc4Yjg0M2Q2MDU3NjQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You alright?” Hammond asked, after a minute of me chugging down the rest of my stew.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzYxMDQxZGE5NzQwZGI5ODZkYjYxNGYxMTA1MDcw"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NTNmMGRkNTU2ODQ1NTRiMTc0YzYyZjJjNDFmN2Ji"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep! But I have work to do!” I said practically chirping. I was adding lasers onto my ship! How could I not be excited!</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWQzZWQzNTRhZTRjODI5M2Q4NWViZmE3ZWIwM2Ex"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNjRmNzg3YzAyNDRkYjM5YmM2ZTk5M2M4NjMwODhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I jumped off the counter and headed for the hold. Time to finish the panels!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTc2MjI5MDAyNDRhNzBiNWQ0YTY4NGEwZjg5OTFi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNDRjMjBkYmJkMjRmN2FhYWE3MjZmODEyZGZmN2Q2"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2JiZjRhMWEwYjRlMDZhMmFmZDIyMmRkODExOTJl"> </p>
<p class="cnNmN2JkNzI5ZTA2MzRhYzM4ZDVkNjliZjAzZDM4YTkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The final panel installed, I stepped well back. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTNkNDNjMWMyZTQ5NTViYmI4NzZmMTRjMDI2YWZm"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NTRkMThkN2MzYjRlY2RhYTIzNDE2MWM3NGExMWRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Okay let’s do a test on all of them.* I called out to the Crabbits on the bridge. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmIxNTUzMjU0ZDQ5NDE5NGVkYWU5ODZhZmJhMmFi"> </p>
<p class="cnM5N2E4ZGJlMWJlMzQwNGNiOTliNWY3MzcwZDUwN2I5"><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later the hatches all popped open with a fast motion, the armored panel splitting open to reveal, well nothing yet. But each of the holes would have lasers in them soon. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzBlMzU2ZjAxODQ5NTJiNmY3MDk3M2RiZGQ2ZmU4"> </p>
<p class="cnNlOTdjY2MyMDk3ZDQ2ZWViNGYyMTkyMjNhMWI4NTdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Okay seal them.* And then the panels slapped back shut securely. *Try putting atmosphere into the rooms now. I want to see if they will hold.*</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">*Roger roger! Adding air! Adding air! Ah! It’s holding! No leak no leak!*</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2YwYmYzZTVhMTQwOWI5NTVhOGUxNGY3OWNhNGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">*Alright.* I said with a sigh of relief. That meant that the ship was once more good to go, we could jump to subspace right now while I finished installing the rest of the lasers.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTk2MDE0NjZhNTQ5OTI4YjYwYzQ2ZDFjMTkzZTdh"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MDA4NjkyODVlMTQ4ZjlhMjY5Yzc2ODRjODc1Yjc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked over and grabbed my tools, before kicking off. I delighted in the weightlessness for a moment as I basically super jumped over the back of the ship, until I came floating in upside down to the open hold.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Njg3ZDZjNzk3YTQyNGFiODA5NmQyYThhMDM3ZTUw"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NDFmZGRiODhiZTQzMDliZGI3ODcxNWFjNGEyMGY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I flipped around and landed gently, as I pressed my Tab. Watching the large hold doors close.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2EzZTgwYWQ5MjQ2MzFhNmM5ODZiZDc4Y2JlZDhl"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMDExZjdmMDk2YzQ5ZmE5ZDMyZDY3YTU0ZDg2NDU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s Hammond?” I asked my shoulder Crabbit who hummed for a second.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTM2NTllZjViMjRkYWY5Zjg4ZjgxNWFjOWM3NDMx"> </p>
<p class="cnNmOWJlNmMzODBjMjRiYzRhNDg0ZjkzNmRiNzI5MDA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! He’s in his room.” She chirped at me, and I nodded. I’ll let him know we were ready to leave then.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDEwODBiMjNkYzQxZDhiZjUzOTA1MjU1NmQ4NTc1"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NmUwNzEwNmE4ODQ4OTRiMDljMWZhMjdkYjc3NWI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I climbed up the ladder, and then headed into the starboard section. He had picked a room on this side, and I found his door and knocked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTlhODBkNTA1MTQ2ZTc5ZTZjMDg4OTdjZjE5MWNj"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMDA5ZDMxZjA3YzRjZjNiNDA3MjAwODAxMWJhMTdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took a minute but he answered. He looked like he had been relaxing, the heavy jacket he had worn up till now was gone showing a lighter under shirt revealing his bare arms that looked like he could have torn Arnold Schwarzenegger in half. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmM5YzE1MGI4YzRjZGM5NDA2ZjM1MTg0OWQxOTRl"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZmViMjUzMGNkMzQ0ZDZiZGM0MjAzODJkYzhlMGY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re all bolted up. Gonna be undocking. As soon as we’re ready. Do you need anything else from the station?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got all my stuff already.” He said a bit gruffly, and I nodded. Hesitating a moment because I wasn’t quite sure what to say before I just nodded again and turned. Time to get to the bridge and then we’d be out of here.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWQ4ZTM2OWZlMjQwOThhOWI0YTkyM2MzMjBkOTNl"> </p>
<p class="cnNjM2E4MWYyZWU0ZjRmMTM4ZTcyNDY0YWJkMzI1Njcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I relaxed as I left him behind climbing up onto my bridge and flopping into my chair with a long exhale.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTYyY2NmMjI2NDRjZDZiZDRiZGFhMzk0Nzc5YmM3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkN2YwNjBkOTk2MzQ0MDg4NTU5NDg3MDFlYzcyNDdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Okay. Time to go, time to find some pirates. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzdmNDAyMDcwOTRlNWI4ZTkzOTYzZWRiNDU5N2Yw"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NDRlYWViMGJlZDRiNjBhZDcyNGU3YWZjYzNiNGMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Time to find some pirates?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWNhNTlhN2U4MjQ3ZGNiZGY0M2Q3MmRkZjVlNTcx"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNjM2NmI0ODM2MDRiNWY5ZGFjMTRhNjI3MzhiYTNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was planning on going after pirates… What was I thinking?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTQ4ODUwZjc2YTQwM2ZhMTVlN2Q1OGY1ZjdlYzVk"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYjY4MTk3MDEwOTRjYmJiNTQ2NTE3YjUwZWU3Y2Nm"><span style="font-weight: 400">But despite the insanity of it all, I didn’t stop and tell Hammond to get off the ship and go flee looking for a more normal job.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzBiZTAxNjQ4ZjRkMGFhODc3NWMyYzkwYTYwMGIy"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YjlhZmU0MjJhMDRmYTRhNmEzZmRjNzE3YWI2ZmRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead I informed the station I was leaving, and pulled away. Slowly powering up the engines and feeling the acceleration kick in as we blasted off into space, and then in a surge of colors, dropping into subspace. </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNjYjBjOTZlN2MzNjRiMDM5M2I4MmE0ZTU5MmE4ZDUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me a bit more light.” I asked, as I grumbled, my fingers not quite able to figure out what I was dealing with.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTgxMzVhMzc5ZjRiMWY4M2U5M2NlZWFkZDUxOWY2"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMTcwZTRkYTVlMDQwMjg4Y2U5MTVlZGI4ZmQzNTAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes yes! Liiiiight!” The Crabbit cried out and then turned on its little flashlight. That let me see what had happened. The cords got tangled, and it had dragged a connection out of socket.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWYxNGRkNzVmZDRmZmNiMjI4Yjc2MGM4Mjg0NDJh"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNzVlMzQxNzI5ZDQzYWE5NjdjYzExMjA1OGYwNTIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I started pulling the section apart, and reordering it. This hadn’t been something I’d done. This whole section needed a bit of cord management, but it’d be fine for now once I reattached this line.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWNlZWFkODIyYTQwMWY5ZDYyOGI2Zjg3NzVjMzhi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMDkxMDhlMGE5ODQ1MzViYjA4OWY4MzM5MjhkMTFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting all the lasers installed was a long task, even once they were fitted in place. Each of them needed a power line, and a computer uplink. I could have done a wireless connection, but…</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODA0MDM2YjFkNDQxNGU5NTQ1NDE4YmViNjJjM2Rk"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YjliOGQxM2YzNzQzYWU5MWMwZjcwZWZhZTBlMDIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well wireless connections could be disrupted. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjgwYTA4YzZmYjQ1MjliYzY1Y2UxY2ZkYzRlYWQx"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OTM5NzFhYmE3YTRjZWY4ZTJlZTNiZmQ0NGQxOGFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t really easy, and from other ships I’d seen almost all of them had just used wireless connections, but I guess my old Earth sensibilities were coming into play. I never liked wireless devices, they just weren’t as reliable.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2Y5ZWM5MzcxOTQ0NmI4NTBmODE3Y2M4MGEyYTNl"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZWQ2ZmUyZmJmZTQ1NzZiNDM5YWFmZjk5ZTQ3YTZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You alright in there?” A gruff voice called out from above me, and I very purposefully went rigid so I wouldn’t bash my forehead into the panels above me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTZmYTUyNzBlOTQyMjM4ZmMxYjM5NDk3YzVlNmU1"> </p>
<p class="cnMxM2VkNjBiZDUxMjQwMTdiMWVhNTdiODA1NGZmZjZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m alright. Just fixing a wiring issue.” I called out. Dang it. My legs were sticking out of the floor panel, and I was on my back underneath it, of course it would look weird. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzg5YmUyZjhiMjRkOGRiOTY1NTNmMDYyN2IzOTkx"> </p>
<p class="cnM2Njk1NGE5YmU1MjQ3ZjQ4NjIzYmMzZDRhYjU1ZmRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I finished reconnecting the cord and looked at my Crabbit on my stomach.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWY4N2I5MmZlZjQ1NWI5OTg1ZDFjYTZhNDk1NGM4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0Yjk3Y2Q0ZGRjZTQxNDc4ZGZjMjIyMGZmMmFiMmJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lighten me up, so I can get out of here?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes yes! Graaaavity!” She cheered and I felt myself go weightless. I pushed out with my finger tips and soon I was floating feet up out of the floor crawl space, and then when I was clear, I snagged my fingers around the edge and spun myself around so I was on my feet on the floor. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmYzOTY5Y2U3YjQ4MTZiMWRhYjEyMTc5ZWQ3MDM0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OGEyZjIzNzUwZDQ3Yjc4NjNjMzI4NjRmNzI3MTFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then gravity returned. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzM0Nzg3NjJiNzQ1MzQ4YjUxM2Q0NjAzN2VhMzk2"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MTk2N2I4YzU3YjQ3MTliMjc1ZmZiM2FmMzhjMTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hammond? Need something?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">The man was wearing more casual clothes than I had seen from him before. His heavy jacket and pants, which I’m pretty sure were armored, were gone, leaving him in a much more comfortable looking long sleeve shirt and slacks.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODQ5ZGUyMjJkNjQ5NWU4NGY4NjNkMTJmODBiZWIw"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMzVmYTYyNWYyODQ3ZWU5ZjdlYTMwZDA0ODgxNjE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">He shook his head. “Just walking the ship. Getting a feel for her.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDg3ZmRmYmI1NjRiY2JhNDYxMWIyYTViZDIzYjgz"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah I understand.” I reached over to the floor panel that had been removed and settled it back into place making the hallway once more safe to walk. “Don’t let me stop you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTUxYWFlMjZmYzQ4MTY5MmRhNGRlZDUxZGEyNzJk"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYjJkNjAwNGVkMjQxNzJiYjcxYzlkYTBkMTlmNTdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. Need a hand?” He offered, but…</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzM3NmVjZmU5MzQxMjY5MTZlMTk1NjUwZTM4MGZi"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZmE3NWUzYzlhOTQwZmNhYmYxOWRjNTgyODljOGQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I had accepted with the lasers, but when I had gone back into the room after finishing the outer paneling…</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjUwMGIyZDUxMDRmMWFhYWFhYWM3MzQxMjZlM2E2"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m good, thank you. This is just how I keep busy.” I added which wasn’t entirely a lie. I guess it was good to know that my newest crewmate could help with emergency repairs, but I wouldn’t put him anywhere near anything too important.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmM3ZDFkN2EzMDQ3ODg4ZDJiODM1NTgyODYyMmQw"> </p>
<p class="cnM0Zjk2YTgxYjU4MTRlYjViMjc3Y2Q2MmIyNWU4OGVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I think his repair ability was about on par with someone who hadn’t taken their scrapper exam back on UNK-L.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTYyMDlhNjI3ZDQ5NjJiMmVhZDNiMGE2NDJlNjUw"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNWZjOWVjNGRlMTQzNjZhMzAxOWFmNjE1ODljM2My"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm.” He agreed, but didn’t actually head off, and I had a sudden realization that… Well he might be crew, but I hadn’t actually given him any work since he had joined.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmUxOTNjYTFjNTQ4ZWFhNWU0YzRiYmU4N2FkMzAx"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YzhlMzVjNWIyOTQ3Y2I4NmY5Y2YzZDExNDI0YzVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was weird. Like super weird.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2Y5Mzk5MDk4YTRlMDk5NzhjMDgxMjQ0MmFlMDNh"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZGE2ZDIzYzYwMjQ2MzQ4NTg0N2M1MTBiZWM3NmI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Usually when you joined as crew for a ship you were put to work. Whether repair, maintenance, cleaning, or some form of support. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGVlNzdiOGYyZTRjYjJiMWNjZTY4NGVjZWY4MzQ3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMzdlMzA2YzEzMjRlNDdhMGYyZWYzN2VhMTczZDM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">But I just didn’t really need anything. The Crabbits handled most of the tedious tasks, like cleaning…</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTdmMDFiYzhlYTQwY2E5ZjhhMjlmMDcxYWZiNzM0"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMDU2MzQxOGNlMTRkZTQ4YmMwNmJlMWE3YjkyYmU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually Hammond. I do have something I need to ask, walk with me while I finish this?</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> I asked, and he nodded instantly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTcyNTU1YTc5YTQzMWJhOWFhNGFkY2E5MWJhYjVm"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNTRiMGI1NzYxMjRkMDA4YzY1ZmY1Njk2MzEyMjlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I headed back to the laser battery room. They were now mostly installed, but I was checking everything and Tactical was running simulations for their accuracy. She was doing okay so far.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGU2ZmUxNDc0MjQ2YmJhOWRkODE3YjQ2ZTQwNmI0"> </p>
<p class="cnMwOGQ4YzI1OGQzMzQ0ZGViYWM3ZGY0ZmIzZjEzOTI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell me everything you know about these two pirate ships? Common tactics? What size ships are they in? Anything like that?” I asked, as I settled in and started connecting up one of the lasers to the power line I had just fixed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzNkYTg5M2Q3OTQ5MzA5YTMxYmRkZWM1MTQzMGQ5"> </p>
<p class="cnNlY2MwZjZiN2I0YTQwMjBhNzcxMGJlMGUzNmFhOTU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It took a while for Hammond to respond, but he breathed out in an exhale and finally spoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDlmNGFlYjg4YjQ0ZGE4YTMxYjEzNzIxMjIzOGE2"> </p>

The massive nebula made travel a bit strange, as you couldn’t easily go straight towards some locations.

The Phantom soared through space, her nose pointed towards the shifting colored nebula. And as we got closer and closer there it was, a massive breach in the cloud a tunnel that was puckered inwards and I wasn’t alone.

<p class="cnMxYWVhOTNkN2Y1MTQzNmVhZGU2ODQ3M2I3NGFhMDRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure!” I shouted, practically laughing, as I continued through the tunnel, enjoying the feeling of the Phantom juking and diving through the path. I could see that the little freighter ahead of me was pushing their engines to try and create some distance from me, but even with the Phantoms larger size, she was much faster than an in system worker bug.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmZjc5ZTU4MDlhNTQ2MGM4NTJmN2M2YzBjZjUxMzdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the tunnel ended, opening up not out of the Nebula, but into it.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyZDQ0OTdkNWEyZDQyNzdiOWIyZjRlNjc5ZjkyMmEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">A massive chunk of the Nebula had been farmed away, and inside was two stations, both of them gas harvesters. Their long ‘tail’ pushed into the nebula, and as the station slowly traveled around the massive cave, it left an indent in the gas behind it. </span></p>

<p class="cnMxZGViZDQzMTRhNDQzMDU4NjI1MWZiZTUxMWFlOGQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced over and Hammond looked calm staring out just like I was.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhYzI3NmViZGM5MjRjODE5Yzc4N2JhODQ4ZjdjMTRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was still strange to have someone else on board, someone I barely knew. Someone so much older than I was.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmNDBjNjY2M2I4MDRlZmZhNDRkYTk3ZDBlNGFmNjhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">But… I nodded as I returned to flying, this was just part of being a ship captain. It would all work out. If he ended up getting annoying, then we wouldn’t work together, and I’d find someone else. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTExMjNhMzE4NzRjMGY4ZTZmNDZmNjM5NzU4NTQx"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNTBiYWE3MTJiMjQ4YzdiMTdlYjgzNTgxNTQxMmFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">It might take a while but…</span></p>

<p class="cnNiNWI0NDY4MDc2YTRiNDU4ZDRhNTNkOTg4NDAyOWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finding my crew… I smiled. Yeah, starship captains had to have a crew. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjU0NGFiYjNmZDQ0ODJiOTU3MmExODkyZTA0Nzg3"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMTJkYTlhZWUwZjRhNDA4YTI2NTY4MmQwNDg3NjVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly a turn in the tunnel and we were out, at least mostly, a massive gap in the nebula revealed the sun, in the large almost…</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmJkOGQ1YmNjNTQ4ZmNiZDk0NjNiZDYwMDliZTZl"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNDQyNTAxNDg2MTQxY2Q5YmE3MTU2NDBiODQxZmJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m pretty sure it was artificial. A massive gap in the nebula that let a planet see the sun. Huh, that must have taken a long time to set up. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmNiNmMzYjA0YjRjMTc4OTY2ODAzYmI4NmY3MTFj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MzM1NDEwMTRkMDQ4OGRhNjg0YTVlNjcwZGNhYzlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s the planet.” I said and he nodded. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjdiNDVjMTNmYzQ5OGZhNDYwODljYTI3MzE1YzQx"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMDRmOTM0MmI3NzQxNjViMTVkNjQ1ZTJjZjc2NTM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here. I have the coordinates. It’s a small town. Gotta talk to the bartender there… Can you set us down outside the city? So no one can see the ship?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGQxNGE0MWQ2NDQ0MzQ4ZDNjZmJhNmQwNTQyMTJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I blinked and looked up at him. “Sure I can, but… That would be a long way away.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNiMDE0NThkODhhNzQ4YWJhN2NiNzkzZTA0ODU0MmVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We take a lifter…” He said and then went quiet as he looked at me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTI3N2M4MWFiOTQ5ZWQ5Y2FkN2RmMjliNmQwOWZi"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t have any ground vehicles.” I responded to his obvious question.</span></p>

<p class="cnNjNjQ3NzBhMmI4ZDRjZDE4MzBjMmJiNmZjYzk5ODE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well shit.” He hissed, out a grumpy sigh.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwMjhhZTNjZDZjMTRhNWE5NmFkMmNmNjA4YWMxMWE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shit was right… I had planned on getting some kind of vehicle eventually, but I didn’t have one yet.</span></p>

<p class="cnNiZWZkZTAyOTI4ZDQ5ZTE5OGQ5MDA5ZTk5YWU4M2Jh"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NWY1ODE2YzA0MjQ2ZjE5OTQ5MmVlNmM0NTk5NGIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">So… I can’t just point the Thermal Lance and wipe it off the face of the planet? I shook off that dark thought. No, don’t be evil. Okay…</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDIzZDA2NzQ4YjQ0NjI4Nzc3ZmZjM2ZlMzcwNDc0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YmVjMTY5ZDZjMTRlMTU4YzAyNWYyNjRmNjEwNGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This planet. It’s a dirt ball right?” I asked, able to tell most of that just from looking at it. Barely any satellites, or space activity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzA0NTYwODg5OTRhM2NiMTc4YjdmMDk1ZDE1M2Rk"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it’s not just the one town right?” </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s got cities. We’re aiming for a small town. Private.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM2OGYxMzYxZWNkODRkYzZiZTdiOGNhYzg4ZDA5Mzk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then we land in a city first.” I decided, and he looked surprised. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGVlNjc3Y2RhZjQ4ZjRiZmQ4ZmViYTVhNzk0ZDFh"> </p>
<p class="cnM2OTI0MDUwYmQ2MTQzYzA4N2ZlYjliMmRkNjRkNmRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re gonna buy a vehicle?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seems like it. Unless you fancy a ten mile walk into and out of town.” I asked him, because that would be the minimum I would have be from the town to even hope to remain hidden. The Phantom Star was a bit of a big bitch. She wasn’t stealthy in atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjk5N2UxMDFiYTRhOGY4ZDlmMmNhNDc2NTk5Y2U1"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZTIxYjJmY2FkMzQxNWI5NTFhYTZiYTAwNTExY2E3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That won’t be cheap.” He said, after a while. “Planet like this, a crawler's gonna be pricey.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you have a better idea? I don’t suppose there would be a taxi from the city to the town?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a chance.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM3MjliZjIyODcyYzRmMzA4NGE1Y2Q3YWI5YTFkYTRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then we buy a vehicle.” I decided firmly. It would hurt my wallet, but that’s what all the cred was in there for to start with, besides, if we managed to take out two pirate ships that was going to be a nice chunk of creds anyways.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjBiY2FiN2UyZDQ1NzVhZGUyMTgyYTE4M2E2ZDJh"> </p>

<p class="cnNlZThiMTYwNDU3MzRhOTJhYzRjOWRiNzRiZDFjZGEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Landing at what I could only describe as some sort of massive slum was a bit of a surprise.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODdhNGQ2MDc3YzRiZjk4YWI2N2E0Y2VhYjk5Y2M4"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NmM0MTU5NWRhNDQxMWRiZTYxYjAwM2ZjZjQxMjE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The entire planet looked brown upon entry, and the smoke, and mess of human habitation had stretched out.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmRlMDVmM2FkYTRmYzJiM2QyMmY2ZjE0OWNjYjFk"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">But more shocking was how bad it all looked. </span></p>

<p class="cnMzOTg0YTViMDI2NjRiOGZhOTA3MTJhMTA4ZWVjYmM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">From the bridge on landing I could look out and just see endless brown buildings made out of whatever material they could find, stretched out into the distance, and masses of people wandering through the streets.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwMWM1N2EzNmE1MTRhZTA4NzYzZjEyODJjODNkZDU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You good?” Hammond called up to me, as I was still staring out the bridge with a sense of serious regret.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzZiMmY5OWVjZDRlYjRiYTBmYjE3ZmVhZDdiNTlm"> </p>
<p class="cnNlODA5Yjk2MzVhYzQxNTE4MTc2ZGVlNGZhZTA1Nzhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t want to walk out there. It was like Starks Point, but worse. </span></p>

<p class="cnMzZTdmMDEyNzdhYTRhY2M5NmQ2OWMzNGJlMjM1NzU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">That had just been a small frontier town. This was like a boom town, hundreds of thousands potentially living in squalor. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2JiMjdlYTIyNTQ5MmM4NWYzY2NhYzZlZjA5Yjk5"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMTM1NjlkNTU4NjRmYjI4MjU3ZWQ5ZjMwNDI4MjI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Coming!” I finally found my voice and called out. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2Q5NGE3MTA5NDRlOWNhODg0OGFmNWI3YzQ2MmJl"> </p>
<p class="cnMwOGQwNzVlNDA1OTQzZjY4MDAzNzQ5MDg3NDgyODUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The shield Crabbit idea was still… Not functional, I had my gun, and I had a big guy with bigger guns…</span></p>

<p class="cnMyOThjZGQ1ZjAzYzQwY2VhMGMzZWQxZDY0YTdjZWU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was going to have to make some armor or something. Maybe a power armor? Or just a walker? A massive Crabbit I could hide in as it moved around? </span></p>

<p class="cnMwMDIwM2YyYmI0YzQzZTRiOGY4ZDMzNTgwYjk1MWQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that was just a tank, and I couldn’t deal with normal people from inside a mechanized war machine…</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjQwNjE5NDNjMjRiYzBiNWNjYzM2OWVmYWNhNjFj"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMmE5ZjBiYmM1MDRhMGRiOWQzMDcwZjY4ZmRmODZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Or could I?</span></p>

<p class="cnM2OWIyOTlmYTQxZjQyYjU4MTFjNzk2ODEyNjc2Yzdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a breath, in and out and then headed for the ladder down. “Yeah, let’s get this over with.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. Shouldn’t be too hard.” Hammond commented, as he adjusted the large coat he had over his shoulders. That did very little to hide the gun he had on his hip.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzAzZWY4ZDQxZTQwOWY5MjU4MTU3YjUzNjM5YmYw"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMTg0MzVkZmFjODQ1ODVhMDRlNzRhZDllNDlhNjg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at least comforted by his presence. Hopefully if anyone felt a desire to point a gun at me, they’d think twice with the massive giant beside me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDRjNTQ1ZjIzNjQ5NmQ4Y2JjMzlhZWQ1Njc0OTIx"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NWVkNDRlNjQwMjQxYWQ4YTMxY2U2Y2I4ZGM1Yzkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">We headed down the ladder, and I grabbed a Crabbit and threw it over my shoulder where it clamped on and snuggled in.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTAwNDQ1ZDRiNDRjMmNhOTQwODlkODRhOTU0Njll"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNDMyNDFjZjgzMDQ1YzM4NmY5N2E5YmU0YThhMDg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? You taking one of those?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep! They’re useful even if they aren’t mobile in atmosphere.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">He shrugged, and we both headed to the ramp which was still up, and I pushed a button on the Tab controls, the moment the seal broke, noise washed over us, slowly opening up the view to the chaos outside.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Yjc3YTA3NTZkYzRhOTc5NjJmNjlkZDI1M2RiNjRi"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OTE4NjEwOWQ3MDRmMjBhNTgzMzIxYmJjZWY1ZjM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">We were on a landing pad, but it was butted right up against a street. A busy street where people were walking by or driving vehicles pulling cargo.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmJiZTdjYjZlMzRlZTJhZjg5ZjBjZWQ1N2FiODJk"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NzI3ZmVlYjQ3ZDQ0NGNiYzlkNGZjNjRjNTgzNWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was shocking that people would be positioned so close to landing pads.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjQxMzk0OTlhYTQ3NzBhOTU3ZmVjNDVlNjFmY2Qy"> </p>
<p class="cnMwODhlOWJmYjMyNTQ3MDY4ZTJhOGE1MzI0M2QyNjU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, most ships wouldn’t just blast engine exhaust into crowds, but… I looked down the road, to the other ships that were parked and it made me anxious to have to walk past them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmQwYmJhMWZhMjQ3Yzk5OThlYWViZjE3MDZmYWI4"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNzdmOTY1MDFiYjQyNjBiZmY2NTQ1Zjg2NjllMzQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">One crazy pilot, and I’d be chewing engine exhaust. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmEwYTY4ZDlkYzQxZjM5MjQ3OTMzYWFmYTBlOGMw"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDcyNWJkMmU1NDRlODhiMDkxYmJjNDc2ZTVmYTdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey hey! You want some supplies! Best dealer on the planet!” A voice called out right next to me, and I jerked. A man was there, reaching out to grab my arm, with a crooked grin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmUxMGRmMzg4ZTRjMzk5MmIxZWJkMjA3MzZhNDhl"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNTg4NjI0Nzg2NTRmMWFhZTk0NmE4MWJjZDllNThm"><span style="font-weight: 400">But then Hammonds hand grabbed the man's arm and stopped him cold.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2NlMzg0MGUzODRhNWQ4NDI0ZDYzYjk0MmI1NzNh"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ODkzMTg5ZmJhYjRmY2ZhZTNiODExMWZhMzdkNmFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beat it.” He demanded in a gravel growl that had the guy skittering back without hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTQ3MDBmODFiODQzM2I5ZDE4NzUxNDMxZDJjNjRl"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YmU2NTE1YTRmMDQ3ZjZhOTA4ZDQ0NTZiMzkwYjZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez.” I grabbed my chest as my heart was beating like crazy. “Did he have to appear out of nowhere?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“This your first time on a world like this?” Hammond suddenly asked, and I looked over and felt my face heat up. I nodded. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDhhNTcwNDVmZDQ3ZTU5NTQ3ZGE4NjI0NTFmMWJm"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOTllMTQ4YzMxYzQ4NzBhNDMxYjc5M2ViOTEzNTU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not like this at least.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Just stay close, and close up the ship. Don’t want anyone sneaking in.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at his orders, and I felt a bit embarrassed that I wasn’t the one confidently doing what needed to be done. I pushed the button on my Tab and the hold doors closed behind us.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTkxMzk0OTE3YTRkNzc5MTE3ZTJjZGFkNTY2NDM0"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon. Let’s go get some information, then a dealer.” He offered and waited a moment for me to follow before setting off into the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTMyNGM4ODQyODRiODY5ODFiNDFlYzM4ZmFiMDc0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZTdmZjQ0YjFiYTQ2ZjhhZWMyYzBmOWY4YzEyMzUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The swarm of people was almost suffocating, but Hammonds massive bulk pushed through and I followed in his wake.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGQyZWI5MDI3NTRkNDFiYjA0ZDU5ZWFkZmU5NDg2"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMTZhNjY0MjA2MzQ0ZmRhMTViYjg2ZWJjN2YxNDUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">My hands glanced over my blaster, and I followed as best I could in the press.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGIxYmZjMTUyNjQ3OWNiMWY2ZTY3MzM4NTU5ZDMy"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMzBjMTRiYWI4MDQxNTQ5ZTllYTZjOGMyZTczY2Rl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally he stopped and turned, and I pushed through his wake as we entered a building that only took me a moment to recognize.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTc3OTUyOTY2YzQ0NzJiM2IwYjA1MTY4YzI0ODRl"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZTY1MmUwMzM1NTRmNDI5OTllOTg3ZWNmZmM3NzM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, of course it’s a bar.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDg1ZTRkMDAwNzRkOGFiYmNkMGZiNjM1OWVlNDY5"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZDAxYTRhNzRmNDQ2YThhM2U4ZDI3ODJlN2NhOWY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a breath, filled up my lungs and stepped into the gloom. I could do this.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxNzYxZjFhNmM5ZjQ3Mzg4N2UzYWQzMjJlZTc5Yzc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The bar was full, and fairly noisy, but it was darker than the outside, and the path was clear. Hammond stepped forward without hesitating and I only followed after I got my bearings. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTQ0ZmM0OTkxOTRkOWRhOGZhZTJiMzYxMGRjNGI2"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMzhmZmJmNzU0ZDQ4ZDdhZDAzNmJmZTg4ODNhNDRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">As I looked around I couldn’t help but wonder.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDdmOTg4MGNhODQzOWZiYmVmMjlhNDlhZjM0YzUx"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNzlkN2NlNjA5YzRjNDI4NTZkMDc1YjdjYmYzOGI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">We were looking for pirates right? Weren’t they all right here?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGRkYTY4YjYzYTQwZGI4OGI3MWQ5NzdlMWU4YTk3"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZWRiMDU5NWMzNDQ2YmRiYmEzNjFhMGZmNzdhODg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The people in the bar looked rough, and dangerous, blasters and weapons, adorned hips and bodies, and it was obvious there was a tension of danger. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTA5ZWQ5NzQ1NjQ3NzFhYjFiNmIwYWFlOGRlOGU1"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNDUzNjMwMTEwMzQzZWQ5OWI0Y2VkMTZlNDVmMzMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes followed not just Hammond, but me as well, and I realized that other than one other, we were definitely the tallest people in the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGIxOGYwZTE1NTQxMmE4MjcxNzkxMmQxZDI3ZTQ1"> </p>

<p class="cnM1YzBhMTI4YWIyZjRmYmU4Yzk0NWRkMzUyZGUxNDM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I scanned it and combined the two pieces, and then sent the request to the Nanopaste that I had in my little store room.

<p class="cnM0NTFlMzgxYzBiZjQ2YWNiYjIxNzFjN2FhNjRlNjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hold door was down as I watched Hammond pull off the road. He looked a good bit rougher than he had before. Dirt and grime coated his face and beard, but as he stepped out of the hauler after parking, he flicked his tab at me before saying anything.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTZhZmJiZWVlNDQwMjdhZTI0NDRlODkxZGM5MzA0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZjFkZjYyNjg3MTRkNGI4Y2I5NWFiNWQ4MmRjYTA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I checked what he sent, and the data was clear.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzUzYTI0MzNkNjQwNTU4ZmUwZDUxZWU4YmRiZmFm"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NmJkMjE3YzEyYTRiM2JiZGIwODQ1OTkwYzUyNDJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Coordinates in the nebula, undoubtedly where the pirates were hiding.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2QwNTVhNDU3NTQ2ODg4NjE0YmQ2NzA3NzdhYjk2"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZjRlNDM3ZWU3MjRhMDhiY2E5MDI0ZmEzNzUzOThi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This legit?” I couldn’t help but ask as I looked up and he nodded. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDQ4MjA0Mzg4NDQzZTg5MThiNWMzMWE4Yjc4Yjlj"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NTdmOTFiZTBjMjQ4NDc4ZWQ4NjZjNWMzMjJhY2U0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d trust my life on it.” He said simply, as he started unloading his stuff from the hauler.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTIyOGM4YzM3NDQwM2M4YTk3NWJjYzEwYTcxMmM3"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MzYwYjAwNzNlZDRiNWY5MzVkZmE4N2ZlOTY2MmJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked back at the Tab, the data was clear. An old hunk of rock floating in the nebula in the middle of nowhere, and even navigation data to get there. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDcyNjYxMDZiNDRhODA4ZWFiYzVkMjE0MDg4Nzdk"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZTZkNmVjOGI1MjQ5MjM4NWU4MWZlMWRhNzRhMmIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">From the information it was undefended, just a hidden little cove for them to dock and repair when needed. But the way the information was formatted… Sounds like this came from the pirates themselves.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGI5ZWI0OGUyODRlNWZiMjM0YjVjY2EzMDQ1MDdi"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYjZjMzAzNGM5ZTRkOTQ4MGFmNDZkYWJiOWJlYjFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook it off, whatever was going on if Hammond trusted it, it was worth at least checking out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDEyODkzNWZhNTQ3ZDk4MzkwYWIzOWMzYjg4NzFm"> </p>
<p class="cnMyM2IxNDlhYTE0ZjRmNDViOTJlOTA1MzFkMGE4MWM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, take some time. Get cleaned up.” I told him, as I started heading up towards the bridge.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTc5YTJiOTE2ZTQwZjJiYjQ5OGMyMDhjZmZhZWFk"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can wait. How long till we arrive?” He asked, his gravely voice more urgent than I was used to.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGMxNDY1NjMxZjQ0ZjA5MDVkOGJkMDM1MmM0Yzg2"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMjc3OWM4YjljZTQxMTk5OTIzYWI3Njc0NDVjNTMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll need to check over the navigation system and find a sneaky path to the location. Wasn’t planning on rushing up there.” I offered and he stilled. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjkxNmNmN2FjMDQxMTg5ZTBjNTU4YjZlYjIyNmZk"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NWUxNTFiM2ZiZTRjOGRiZmFkNTRkZmU4ODIxZjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">He seemed to swallow whatever he was going to say and nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmNhYjBkMmE1MzQyMTI4ZGI5OWIwMDIyZDZjZGUy"> </p>
<p class="cnMxODA4YjQ1ZWNiNjQ1ZTI4Njg1M2ViMjY3NGJlZGVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I’ll hit the head.” I nodded in turn and hurried to the ladder. I could put this into the navigation computer, and get some better details. Maybe even a Warp emergence I could use. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhODNlZTIyOTJmMDQyYzU4ZTE1NmYwZDYxYzdmYmFl"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZmEyMjk2ODgzNDRlMTc5OTliODYzZGJhZWM5MDU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">No, probably best to try and sneak through the nebula quiet. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjY1YjczZWViYzRkYTdiOTY0MDQwMmEwNjY5YTc1"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NTUwNzQ4ZjI3YjQ3YjE4YzdmODI0OTA0YmE5NGVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d have to check out the data before I could decide.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDA4YWUxNWI0ODQ0NTA4OTg0NWUwNDUwMjdlOWYw"> </p>
<p class="cnM2Zjg5MDkyYmFiOTRkMjQ5YTFjNzQxYWExMTU5ZWQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I slipped not into my captain's chair but to the navigation console when I reached the bridge and transferred the coordinates over. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzA4ZWRmNmRmNjQxMWVhZmU3Y2QzZmQzNDk0YWE4"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYjU1NmI5NGU0YTQzOGZhODA3OTI0ZDhlZGMwY2Q2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Help me find a path?” I asked the Crabbit still sitting on the console and she cheered .</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDkxMWMyN2IwMDQ3NzQ4ZmRiYzFmMjk2YjYzNGRm"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYzVjNzg1ZDU3MTQxMjRhZmE3ZTY3MzU5ZTlmMDc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You bet! Quick path! Quick path!” She chattered, and I smirked. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGJlODhkZjlkNzRhZWRhOTliNDZiMmE1YzVmZGI2"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NzRmODQ4NzUwYTQzOWU5ZWFhNTdhOWUxZTZlN2U4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We don’t want the quick path. We need the sneaky path, we’re playing hide and sneak.” I told her, and she went still her face screen shifted until her optics were locked on my face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDE0Y2RhMmE0ODQzOGI4NDFmZDdkNWExMmIyYzk1"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMzViMmMyMGY3MDRlMzhiM2RmMGQyYjlhNDFlMjFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hide and sneak?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehehehehehe!” She cackled almost evilly as she started going over the data, I noticed instantly as the console lit up with calculations that she was borrowing processing power from her sisters.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTJjNmNjMGZjYTRlODY4YTgyOThjYWFlODc0ZjNi"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YTFiZDI5MTBkYzQ4ZjFiYmEzMzY1NzUwYWRjNDQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Heh Crabbits always did take hide and sneak seriously.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzBmYjZiMjU0ZTQ2MjlhNzk3NGFjZjE4OWJkZTli"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZDA4NTFmNDQ2MDRjNTY5NmExMGQyZDk4ODdkMzM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I settled in, let’s find the path that gives me the best chance for victory.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGVjOTZlZjZjNzRlNGZiZmFhNzVkMDY3NWFkNDQ5"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNGZjNWJjMzk5MTQ5MzZiZDhjNzI3MzVkZGZkZmNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Path, after path was pulled up, checked, and thrown away as the Crabbits and I worked. Finally we came to a decision.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTVlODVlOWRmOTQ3MjBiOWQwYWUxMzhkYTUyMzIz"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNDkxMmQwMjQyNDQ3OGZhOWM5YWY5M2E0Mjg5Nzdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">We’d leave the atmosphere, and jump to warp, go to a part of the nebula that was barren, facing out into nothingness, and pass through from there.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDg5MWEwNjAzOTQ0ZDk5ZmQ3YzQzYjFkOWNkZmU3"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYzZkNWYyNDU4ZjQxMjc4OTk3ZDZkZDg1OTk1NWMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was slightly more dangerous, as the nebula was less scouted on that side, so I’d have to go slow, but it should be much harder to notice us over there. Pirates wouldn’t be checking a section of space that no one traveled through. They’d be keeping an eye on the more active areas.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjE1ZDcwNjhiNDRjYjI5NTg5NTU4ZWM0MGY0NmU3"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZjAyOWU3ODJiZDQ3MTNiM2JlMjNmZTE4OGU4ODdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hopefully. It was worth at least attempting to be sneakier. If it didn’t work, then it would be a battle regardless.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzY0Y2UyNDNmYjRjOWZhYjFmM2ZmODRjYjgwZWYz"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNjAyNGE1MDMzNDQwOWE4OTBlOWZhYTQ2NmI2YzBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded satisfied at the plan, before I realized I had other tasks I needed to do.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjhmNGFjNzA4NTQwMjI5NTRkMGMzMTJlMWFhODU3"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNDU1NTU2YThkOTQ2ZmM4NzMzMTY4ZWRlZDM1Njdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d want to batten everything down, and prep the nanopaste sprayers. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWU3NDI2ZGU3NTQwYzk4MTQ1OTI5ODg4YjRkZDc3"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNWRjNTNmZmQ3ZDQ5OTQ4NWY4Mjk4MTkxN2I4YWRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a battle, and no matter how dangerous the Phantom Star was compared to a couple pirates, I had learned a valuable lesson from the Octavius. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTI4M2JlZjNmYjRhOWRiMGE0ODlkZjcyODM4M2E3"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">A good trick could ruin your day.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjVmYjI0ZTk4MDQ0NGI5NGYxMTBhNGY2NjIzOGVl"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZDQ1MjY2ZTA5OTQwYjZhZjIxMDczMjQ5NjYxZDkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Good thing I’d already come up with a few myself, just in case.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2E4OTUzMjgzOTQ2ODQ5MjMzNjExNDY5MzRmNDcw"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDljMGJjMWZiMDQzZGU4NWE1YTViZmZmMTAzOTU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">As I hurried around the ship, locking things down, and talking to the Crabbits about a neat trick to hopefully secure us a win against anything strange, Hammond came up from the Hold, his hair still a little damp as he wiped at it with a towel.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWY4NTVkYmY2ODQ0YjRhMDFhMjUxNDQ5MzIwYjVm"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZWY0NmQyMTk0YjRiMjQ5ZWE1NDAxYmExM2ZhZDIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re pretty much ready for liftoff. Going to jump to warp, and come around the Nebula from the rear. There’s less traffic that way, and it should let us get close without them noticing. I explained as I went around the halls, closing doors as I passed, and locking them down.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWRjNTJhZmI5MTRiYWE4ODM5ZTRlYTZlN2JjZjQx"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZjE1Yzc1MGFmNDRkZWU5N2VhNTQ0YTM2NTg1MWEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">They probably wouldn’t help if we got a bad hole, but maybe it would, you never know.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzhlZmY3NGJiMzQyZWFiNTRkOGNkOTkyNTc3YTRl"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZWYzMGRhN2E4NTRiYTJhNzE5YTEzYzViZjY4Mzgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it. Where should I go?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, the bridge would be best, so you can see what’s going on, but if you want to prep your gear near the airlock? Or the hold… Probably the airlock. We’re going to have to board them at some point, the airlock is more secure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Airlock it is. I’ll get geared up then.” He said without seemingly worrying about the combat ahead of us, and hurried off.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTY5ZDU3YzE4ODQzNTliYTlmM2Q2ODU2MjE3MGUz"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYzI4Zjg4ZWU5YTQyN2FhMzU3YzFhZjY4YjE0ZTI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now if only I could get my stomach to stop doing flips. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmU1MWU5YzgwOTQzNzZiNDkxYWM4YjE2ODk4OWMy"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZTMwZTI4ZDM1OTQwZDViYzI2N2FjNzU3OGI4ZmE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWQyMjQyMDcyZTRjNjM5NDg5ODQ2MWU0YmEzNzdm"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZTFjYTZiNDM2MzRkNTA5Y2RlODdhZWNmMzhlMTVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">A quick burn off the planet and then just far enough that I could drop into subspace, and as far as the system was concerned, we were leaving.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjcwNDA0NzQ2MjQ5NzViMjdmNmE1NGU0M2Y1YzI4"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMDY0YzcwOWRjNjQ3ZjVhMjQ2MjM5ZmE5MjRkNWYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, plenty of sensors in the system would be tracking our travel through the system, but as we started heading out away from the nebula, it would be obvious we were leaving and we would drop from anyone paying attention.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjcxMzM2MDQ5MTQxYWY4ODRiNmY3ZDQ1NDRjNDhh"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MDBkYmJjNDMyOTRmZjliM2VmZDVmODM4YmQ4OWI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then far away, in a burst the Phantom Star returned to real space.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWUzYTY2ZjNhYjQwZDQ4Yzk5ZDJhOTNkYzU4YWRk"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYjJkM2NkMjlkYjRmMWM5MGEwMGMxZWFhMWUxOWJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I did what I could to lower any sensor registry from there. Our sensors went dark, as we turned and just followed the path I had decided on before ever lifting off.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmYxNjNkNDJlNTQzYzk5NjM4NThjMjY0MTcyNWNj"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZjFjMjY4ZWJiNzQ3YWM5YmYxZTBhNDZhY2Q1MDQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hammond stood uneasy beside me, the guy was covered in guns now, a massive rifle strapped across his chest that I was pretty sure was a really high end laser kept catching my eye.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjJiYWNhOTdkZDQwOGQ4Y2NiYjA0ZDdhYTQ5MmE2"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZGY3MGJjZjMxMzQxNWVhMjgwZjIwYmY3NThlNmNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It had a pretty song.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGQ0NzI4OTdlODRkY2VhNDZiYzcxYzRkMWE0NmE5"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNDZlZTdiYjIzZTQ2NTlhZjc1YTI1ZGZjZGVlNTYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">But I focused on maneuvering us back to the nebula and then once we were inside, I turned back on the sensor systems, setting it to very short range.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjlmNTUxY2VhNzQxNjlhZDcwNjVkYmYxODdiZjRl"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YjU0NWNkNjBhYjQzYTU4MWZjNDhiNTczZGUxMzRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well even if they did notice us, they won’t now. This Nebula might as well be soup for all the return we’re getting.” I muttered, and Hammond relaxed only partially. I noticed the way his hand kept clenching and unclenching. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2MxMDA0MTBkYzQ3YmRiMWY3NTcyZWYxNDZiMjQw"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYTYyYTY0Yjk1YzRlYTBhMWFhOWZiMzFhZGE3OWQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was nervous, his eyes never leaving the sight of the nebula we were flying through. The multicolored gas cloud glowed even this far from this systems sun. It rippled as we passed through it, reflecting sunlight into a refractory brightness.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTg2Njk0MmFjMzRjNTg4MjJkZjYzM2NlZGI0ZmNi"> </p>
<p class="cnNkN2IxMjMzN2VlNzRmZmVhODczZmNlMWJkNDA1NTZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a blip on my Tab’s screen, just barely there for a moment. I gave the ship a sharp adjustment, just in time to miss an asteroid floating in the soup letting us fly around it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjhhZjgxZDA2MzQ5ZjE5NjdiNmIyMzc3YTE3NmZi"> </p>
<p class="cnMyODY0NTJhZTRkZDRkZjk5YmVlNTAyM2IwZDM1ZjU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give the sensors a bit more power.” I told my Crabbits, and I watched my Tab clear up a little bit on what I could see. Didn’t want any more close calls.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDVmNGI2YTY5NDQwNmZiNDI5OGVkZjcxNmRkNTBm"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZmZhZWUzOGUzNzQyZDRhOThjYTQ2MjEyODViZDNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dangerous, this was really dangerous, but I was fairly confident. I just needed to get close.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWJkYWEwMTIwNTRlN2M4YjMxN2Q2NmJhNGEzZDgx"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMmQxMjA2ZmFjYTQxNmM5Njc1MzgyODZlNGEyODY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How long until we get there?” Hammond asked, and I hummed, not really wanting to take the time to check. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2FkNmI0MmM3YjRiMGVhYzJhNmM5ZjZhZWRlNTVl"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNTUyNDBlYjFkZTQ3NGU4MTE4ODM0ZDEwYTVmZGQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Navigation ETA?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh! That’s me! Hmm. Fifty eight minutes!” She called back, and I nodded. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGM0Zjc1ZDgzMzRhMGFhZDYxZThkZTA5NjQ1M2Q3"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZmUyZjg3YTc4YzRjNjlhMzBjNGViOWM1NTU1MTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That long?” He asked, as I once more, shifted, flying part of the gas cloud, so I could avoid the less dense areas.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDUyNTFlMTM1ODRmMzQ4NGRhZGFlMDMxNmUxOGM5"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re trying to be sneaky.” I explained, Sure, we could have arrived in a very short amount of time, but that would have been very direct, and very obvious.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzQwNWViNzZmMzQzMGZiNjk5N2FmZDk5ZTUyOWU2"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNDZlMWNlNzZlZDRlMjg4ZGFlYTRhZmQ5Njc3NTVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I reversed thrust, reaching over on my Tab, to flip the engine output.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTA1MjMxOTg4ODQ2Yjc5OTAzOTZjYzM3YmI1Y2Rk"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMTMwODAxYjY5ODRlYTY5YjI3NDVlMzgyYmU3NTcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then dipped down, flying around what could have become a moon if not for this nebula being sucked up by humanity.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzY4ZDMzODMyNzRiZTliNGZiYTUyY2NjOTU2NTYy"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MTQ0Y2MxZWZlNTQ4NDQ5ZjUwNTUxNWRmNDAzYWU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no straight path that isn’t watched, so we aren’t taking one.” I explained, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw his face firm, and nod. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTYwMzVlNTA5ZDQ3NzM5Y2NiMGJhOTllOTIzZTY5"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZWY4YjI0OWU3YTQ4MzhiYmYzOWYwODE5YTZjNzBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Good, I really didn’t want to argue about the path I’d chosen anymore. It was already not fun to fly through.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzMTZkNTIzNzA1NjQzZmZiYmFlMTdjN2U3ZjE5YTEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Constantly checking the Tab, adjusting course, and speed, all so that I wouldn’t smash into something. </span></p>

<p class="cnNkY2RjNTExOTg2YjQ2ODlhMDE4ODZkMjdkNWYxMTA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah Hello! Hello!” The voice came out of the sound system on her Tab, which now had a pair of digital eyes looking back at her. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGYzYjUzYWY0MDQ0NGQ4MTAyOGQ1MDA3ZWViZWI1"> </p>

I’m here to help! I’m a Crabbit!” It greeted her cheerfully, and she was struck dumb for a moment trying to understand, even as the lights on all her systems flashed as it started accessing them…</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmQ3NzZmYzYzNjQ2NTFiYTYyNjRlZDAzMGE2OWNi"> </p>

<p class="cnM3MTZhMjAwNjNlNzQ5MDA4YWRjZjM4NjU5MDBmZWUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">She felt her back press against the wall as she watched the eyes bounce happily around the large Tab screen before it blinked and looked at her. Directly at her. Despite just being a digital construct it was looking at her.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1MTkzNWY1Njk0MzRlYWY5ZDRkNDk0OGFmMjAzZmE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">All but what was in her room.</span></p>

Second ship is powering up weapons!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s fine, we already confirmed our target. How’s the signal?” I asked as I started really putting the power into the engines. We had a cleaner map of the area, so I could fully let the Phantom run loose.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODA3ZDhlMTBkNjQ1Y2I4M2QxZTg5ODk5ZGQxZTZi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZDhkZjA1M2Q2YTQzMDVhOTgyOWVkNDAzNzlhNTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooh! They’re bad at math!” My sensor Crabbit informed me, yet despite that I could see the targeting lock on the enemy ship distort and fail.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkMzA2ZDRlZGEwYjQ4Yzg4NGNkMjc0ZmMyZDRlMTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not all the pirates had been sucked out with their entire atmosphere, unfortunately old Earth movies had lied to me about the dangers of decompression. Unless you were right at the front of the breach, so an entire force of the oxygen sucking out was behind you, you’d probably get thrown around a bit but be okay.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDNmMGUwN2FlNTQwYjk4NDIzNGUxNmNjZDg1OGYy"> </p>
<p class="cnM4OTgwMWIxZTFkYjRhZDhiZmY4OTEzMTZhNTY3MWMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shame, but it would definitely keep them out of the fight long enough, which was good since Hammonds bounty target was on that ship, and currently working with a Crabbit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2QyNjZlMzVmYTQwYTlhZDU2NDk3ODgyMTlmOTRk"> </p>
<p class="cnM0Mjc0NDVkOWMyOTQ0ZjlhOTcwNTU0NTkxNmIyMTgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">We’d gotten lucky they had been so quick to accept a Crabbit upload.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmNGMxYzEwZWQxYzQyYmU5YzU2ODM0ODM2ODEyNTEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked over at the Crabbit settled in the corner, the poor things Tab screen was dimmed, as its mind was elsewhere. </span></p>

<p class="cnNiYzk1Zjk5ZTU2MzRhOGQ5ZTA3OTllMzA1OWQ1YzA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">It also had a whole horde of additional Crabbits in the ship giving their extra processing power to make sure it’d be able to control that ship for a bit.</span></p>

<p class="cnNiMjA2MTI0YmJmZjQwM2U4NTNjM2I1MjE1YWRkNTZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook it off and focused. “We’re charging in. Get me a starboard broadside aimed and ready.” I demanded, and Tactical started whispering numbers under her breath.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzM4NWZiOGIzYTRlN2NiYjNjOWE3ODc4ZmQxODJm"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNzM0ZWY4MjU2ZjQ0OWU4OTRjYTQzOGNmMDA4OWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was kinda scary, but she was my scary.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyZDNhMDRmNmQ2ODRkNTNiNTFlMTJiN2M5YzUwMmY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A broadside?” Hammonds rumbling voice cut in, questioning.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to get in between the two ships in case they decide to fire on their allies before trying to escape.” I explained and Hammond instantly nodded. He’d been very firm that I had to do everything I could to keep his bounty alive. So that’s what I was doing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjFmOTIzZmRiNTQzNTNhMzk2MzFiMDMwYjUyODQ1"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YmNiNzViODg0YzQxODliNDFhODI3NGMwYWNjYzg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn’t expected him to react so strongly when we got a distress message that was actually a normal comm. What a weird trick. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTk5MzVhYTRkMTQ2YjRiMmFmZjJhMjczYmU2YTIy"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOWRkM2U5YWZjNzRiZDFiN2I0YTAwYmQ4Y2FhODBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up from the Tab just in time to see a lucky shot ballon our shields. The blue cloud of energetic particles expanded before dimming out of view as the ballistic round slammed into us.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjVlNWU0NzU4NDRiMzk4MTZiNTkxMmM5OWY0OGI5"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a lucky shot, and not a threat. “Keep their lock ons off me.” I reminded, and the Crabbit continued to work.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTgzYjI2ZmZlOTQyOWY4ZTFmZDczOTFhMmFmYzRi"> </p>
<p class="cnM0Yzc2ZWE0YjBiYTQwNjI4M2JkNGZkMzNiZDk1ZTNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were a little sluggish. Too much of their processing power was given to the invading Crabbit right now.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjNiNTNiYjJlZTRmY2I4NjE1MWFjYzc2ZGNiOGNk"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNzM0OTFmMDQ2OTQyZTZhNjlhZTUwZjllM2FlY2E2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something to consider for the future. Maybe a box full of processors to give them more power in emergencies? Wouldn’t be good long term, but for short bursts- I shook off the wandering thoughts, and flipped the button on the Tab before pressing it again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmRhMWIyOTIwMDQ2ODc4NjUyY2FhNGMzNTlmOGVk"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYzRlZGFjMzlkNjQ3YjE5YWYxNWJhZGY5ZTU2MzJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Nebula burned a little as the Thermal Lance turret started firing its lasers. Missing unfortunately, but I wanted the pirates on the back foot. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjI1MWRhOTFiODQ1ZDhiODFjMjU5NTgzNzllMzcz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYjQ3YWJmNmM5NDRjMWU4ZjAyMDgwNjkzY2M0NjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">They might not even realize what kind of weapon it was at the bow of my ship.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWFlNGExOWJiZTRkYjFiOWY4ZjQxNTQ5MjUzOWQ1"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NjkyZjA3MmNhMjQxNTk4YjMwYzA5Nzc4N2ZjZDI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched closely as the turrets lasers managed a lucky hit, but I didn’t flick the switch for the Lance to open up. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTA0OGM3MWFkZjQ4ZmFiZThiZGRjMTIwNzAyNTdh"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNWY2NTRhMGYwMDQ0MTE4OTBhODdlOWJlZGYxY2E3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How's their jump coming?” I asked. This wasn’t like the last time I’d faced pirates. We weren’t working with a Kenish Navy Frigate with a military level of finesse towards Electronic Warfare. Nor were we outnumbered and prey. I was the biggest ship in the area, and these pirates were scavengers, preying on the weak. Of course they’d try to jump into subspace and escape once a warship showed up.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDI4MTY5Y2FkMjRlYTViYTEwNzU5MjBmZWY0MTYw"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDY3YWY1YTE4ZTRhY2Y5NWZjODY2ZWZlNDZhMjIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was one of the reasons Electronic Warfare was so important. If I flooded their sensors with enough false data their Warp Controller might not be able to handle the data to safely jump.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OThmYTIyZThiYTQ3NzNiYWEwMWJhZGYyOWE0NmY0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZTEyNjA4ZmM4MDQ4NzJhNzVlNjIwMGQyMTNmNzJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right now the Crabbit at the EW station was more on the offense than defense. Trying to keep that ship in real space so we could take it out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmZmNjBhNDg2NTQ4ODQ4ZDc0YTk2YmFlY2JhODhh"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYzY0NDRmYzBmNjRjM2RhNDllNDFkOTM2ZjYxZmQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Another hit to the Phantoms shields flared up, but it was minor at best. These pirates only had armaments capable of threatening civilian ships. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmE1NmRmNmMxMzRlMzZiNDkwMDkyZTA1NGNlOWZi"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NmYwODEyYjI0MDRjMDVhNWQ1YmZiMGRlMjQzODY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">In return I now had an angle, not just the Thermal Lance turret, but the new Laser batteries on the starboard side fired, And I watched as the pirate ships shields flared, as a few of the lasers managed to hit as the green lasers searched through space for their targets. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjMwYTNiYzgzYTRlMjdhZWVmNWJmZjczNzY3OTRm"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMzdkODY5NzI3MDQ1NTJiNzdlNTAwZmJlYTYwNWU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">To the Phantom they were just prey.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODRlMDQ2NWE5OTRhMWI4NTExYmQxYTA4YzhkNmUx"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Then it was time. Just before the Phantom would cross over the barrier from long range to knife fighting, I accelerated even more. A little bit of extra speed I’d been saving. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGM3ZDc3MmI5MjRmZmI4OTRkY2I5Yzc3NDg0ZTAy"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNWViZDMzZTE2MzQ2ZGM4NWM3NDc1Njc0ZjI3ZmVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">It meant that the moment we crossed the barrier, the pirates largest weapon, a Rail Gun of some sort, missed, as they’d been using data from my previous speed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2QzZGM5NGQ3MTQwMDI4NDhmNmI4NDUwZTA4NzUy"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZjc1OTNjMDMzMzRiNWRiMDQ2ZmU3YTM2MTk2YzI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Without the ECM interference, the Phantom’s sensors locked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGE4YWU5NzdhYzRhYjViMTEzZWMzYWZjOGExMjc5"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NmViNGZjODhlNTRlYzY4NzM1ZGY3OGI3Mjk5ZGM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Firing!” I called out and thumbed the button on the tab for the Thermal Lance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDY5N2ZkNmM1ZDRmNWFiYWJhMWNhOGU3ZGI2MDY5"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZmJjZTliNjY3MzQwNmE4ZjIwYjE0ODBiYzk1YjY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">If the lasers and weapons shooting through the nebula had lit up the gas into a kaleidoscope, the Thermal Lance ignited a star. Everything went pinkish white, and the viewport dimmed in response to protect my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWNlMzMwMDc3ZTRjMzI4ZGNkZWMyYzk2MDhhMzE3"> </p>
<p class="cnNhY2E4YjEwZTExYjRjM2VhNmUyMTRhNTg3NDA1OTdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Direct hit! Math was correct! Math is best!” The Tactical Crabbit cheered startling Hammond as he looked from her to me, but I just focused on the viewport.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDUzYzhhYTJhMzQxMDE5ODAzNzI0Njc2ODAyOTk5"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYmQyZjYxNjYyOTRiY2M4ZmY5YWM4MjUxNTVmYmJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The glare faded as the reflection of the light on the gas faded, and it showed my deadly work.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmM4MzgwNDVjNzQxMmE5NzE1MzBjNmQ5NjY0YmIy"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNWVkZDc4MmNmNzQ0ZGJhMDEzOWNiMjE2NDllOWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I swallowed as I watched the former pirate ship list to the side.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGM4NDg3OWE0MTQxM2JhYzE4YjBmODFhODM3YTFi"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YzM3MjVmZjYyZDQyNDg5YTdmNWVjNGE5ZDU1NDdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wouldn’t be jumping to subspace anymore.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGNmMGExMzZjODRhY2M5OWNmNjIzOTViNWU2MzBl"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZjg1YTE1NzU0MTQwNGZiMzcxMTM0MWFhNzgwNDcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s the other ship?” Hammond prompted, after a while and I blinked away the scene seared into my mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTUyZDMwYmU0MjQzNjRhNWEzNDNhOWVhODBkMDg5"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMTBlY2QxNTQ1YTQxOGM5NzFiOTEzNjFmZTc2OTU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. The other ship.” I turned, the Phantom. Work wasn’t done yet. </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM0YWU5ZjQzMTEwMzQ4MGVhMWQ4MTljOGVjMDI1ODgy">With both ships disabled, this fight was mostly over. </p>
<p class="cnNiYmYxNzNiZGRkZjQwMjU4NDA0NzU3YjgxODIxYmVj"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNDlmYjUyNzBmZTQ0MjM5NzY3M2VjMzE5NzBlZmFk">But just because the ships were dead, didn’t mean the pirates were.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzE2YWY5NmRiMTQ2NDhiZTAzNWQxZDFjNGZhZWQw"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNjhlODJkYzExNTRkYTk5MDI2Nzk0YTIwYjA1MWQ5">As the Phantom came up on the side of the overridden pirate freighter, I could already see pirates on the hull of the ship, those that had survived the decompression and being yanked out of their ship already returning to try and retake it.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODk5OGY2ODI4NjQ2OGZhNjhmNzJiNmVhOGMwMjJi"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NzY3MGRiZDc2YjRiYzM5NjY0MGJlMzU0YTg2ZjI2">“Do it.” I whispered to myself as my thumb hesitated over the button. I watched as they turned to me, and some even had weapons on them, minor lasers flashed over the Phantoms shield, doing so little it might as well be a joke.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGE2Yzk1YWNhMDQzNWI4MDFiMjliM2JiZTdkNThh"> </p>
<p class="cnMzOTcxZmFiOGMyYTQ4NzVhNzJlMTJjMDFlYWNlYzhi">I pushed the button. The laser battery had already locked onto the pirates.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2VkYjU5NzVhMTQzNDA5Njg1ODAyZGUwY2NiOGE4"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMWQ0YjY3YjI4ODQ1NjI5ZDgxNGE3ZDU4NDZiMjdh">Naval scale weapons, even just the smaller lasers that I fired did terrible things to people.</p>
<p class="cnMzODc5ZGRmNmMyMjRjMzQ5N2U1NTU3MDBiNGI2ODc5"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMWNmODAyNGYxMjQxMTc4ZWQ2N2FhN2NhMzc5OGJm">I looked away, unable to really watch as the lasers lashed out using the Crabbits calculations to strike the men. <br/><br/>Soon the only thing left was already cooling craters in the ship's hull.</p>
<p class="cnMzYWUzNTNmMTllOTRlNzA4YTNhZWEwNzA0ZGE0MWVl"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYThmNDk5OWQ4YTQ2ZTc5MzZkYzQxZmY3NTJmZTYw">“Hammond I’ll connect with the port airlock.” I told him, and as soon as the words left me he was gone, rushing off the bridge.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODg2YmZiNGJiZjQwNDJhNzdhMjM4Y2E4NjQ5ZmIz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNTE2ODE1OTI2YzQ4NGQ5MGRjYzI4MWNhNjM2MDc4">With a few shifts on the controls, I maneuvered the ship into place and then we locked with the pirate freighter.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDJjYzAxM2FlODQ4NWM4M2ZjNmRhZjZkZjYwM2Vi"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMTVkYThiMjMxODRhNGI5YzM5MmZkYWRkZGJkOTU3">I sat there for a while, should I get up? Should I go help? I wavered. I really wanted to just sit here and cry for a while, but instead I rose up and moved. </p>
<p class="cnNkNmIyMDBkZGE0MzQzNmJiYTdlN2Q4YzMxYzNmNzRm"> </p>
<p class="cnM2OGFmYWI4MTI2ZTQwMDhiNGNkOTQ2NTdlNTkzNjZm">Hammond was crew, I wouldn’t let him go alone, and more importantly… I needed this. This was part of being a ship captain. If I was going to hunt pirates, I needed to do this. </p>
<p class="cnM0NDU2Nzg4NjNhMjQ3OThiYzdlODI5MGQ4ZGM1OTBm"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOGQ5YTRiNTUzNDRkNzRhZjRiNzE3MThhOGZmNjJl">“Oh! Oh! Is it our turn! It’s our turn right? Right?” The sudden appearance of a small squad of Crabbit floating up onto the bridge before I reached the ladder distracted me, and I took a moment to recognize which ones I was looking at.</p>
<p class="cnMyNzU0Yzg0NGU4YjRmNTU5NzY2ZmQxOGRlNDYyMjc1"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZTBkYjc1ZWQzODQ2Mjc4NDRhNGVmN2RlNzdhODU0">“I don’t think you’re really ready, girls.” I muttered remembering the last experiment with them.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWRjZWY3OThkZTRlMzBiMjc4MzBlM2YwMzZjYjRj"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMGNlOTU2NTVlODQzYmY4OGUzOTc0MGEzMDg3M2Rl">“Pleeeease! We want to help! We can help! Pleeeease!” One of them begged at me, tugging lighty on my sleeve, and I sighed and let out a chuckle.</p>
<p class="cnNjZGQ0OTI2ZDczMDQyOThhZDI4Mjg1Yzk1Y2I2NGE3"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZjY0NTRiOTVkMTRjY2JhMzYyOTg3OTI2YTIyNzM1">Of course they had no issue with the killing we had just done. They were innocent. Just happy to help. To do their job.</p>
<p class="cnNlMTgzYjcyOTkyYTQ0NzVhOTBlZTQ3NmY3NmZkYzFl"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MWE4ZTI0NGI5MzRhMTM4NzA2YWE2M2Q4NjQxYTI3">“Alright, come on, let’s catch up with Hammond.” I called and turned to the ladder hurrying down. I raced across the ship to the airlocks and caught Hammond at the door. He had stalled for a moment, as he worked on a personal forcefield device around his neck. </p>
<p class="cnNhN2Y5MmQxZTVmNzRlYTE4NjYwMWU3ZGRjM2ZhZjg5"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNmU3MjRkZTE5NTRmYzhhMDM3YmJiOTcwZDE2OTgw">It looked cheap, and I did actually recognize it. While mine was built into my suits, and was a solid model that could save me from sudden decompression at any time, his was an old military issue.

<p class="cnMzMDJhMWNmYzcyODQ0OWRiZWQxNjA2OWQxMjkyM2Rk">Once he was done, he looked at me. “My main target is going to be the Bounty. I need to find and secure her. I’ll clear as I go. Just stay behind me, and keep my back clear. It could take a while to find her.”<br/><br/>“Wait. We know where she is.” I told him and he blinked in surprise. I looked to the Crabbits who cheered at getting to help, and the data beeped on his Tab. He looked at it for a moment checking his path and then he turned, hitting the switch for the door. </p>

<p class="cnM4NjE5ZTQxOGUzODRhM2ViMjg2YTIxMjc5Nzg5MWM3">His large laser rifle led the way into the decompressed ship. Stalking his prey. He looked menacing, and I was sure that his bounty, the woman that had actually reached out to the Phantom before the battle, would not be escaping from him.</p>

<p class="cnNiZmUzNjkwODYxMTRkNmViMWIxNDA4MDk4MDhjZjNk">I drew my blaster, and the Crabbits took places around my shoulders as I moved towards the airlock. Hammond was already farther ahead, rifle checking corners.</p>

<p class="cnNmMTY1Njg0MTg2YTRlYzlhNjk4OTUxNDI2YWJiYmRj">I felt my hands go clammy in my gloves even with my Crabbits around me for some protection.

<p class="cnM4ZDBiMjIwZjM3MTQ0ZGY5ZDM5NzNiMDMzNTdmZjg0">A moment later there was an explosion washing over me. The shield emitter had failed.

<p class="cnNmNGRjMWMxYmFlMzRiNmQ5ZjI3Nzg5Y2I3MGFhZmVm">He walked over and slammed a fist into it a few times to my surprise.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzMzYTlkODRjYTQ3NzJhODkyZWEzOGFhY2IyNjJk"> </p>
<p class="cnNlM2UxMzI4MjM5ODQzYWI4MGU4MTc5MzAzMDcwMDkw">“Not worried she’ll try to shoot you?” I asked, and he just jerked his head in a no.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTI2MzNhNGY1ZTRiZWY4MDBkMGQ2ZTI2OWZjYzQy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMThhMTI4MWFjMDQ2NTk4NjNjMTEwOGMyMzgxODE0">I could feel the door unlocking through the plating below my feet as it rumbled, and then slid open.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTNkOGVlNzZhZjQ0ZTY4MjA5YTMyZTA5ZmU3ZDAx"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNmMxZjI1ZWViYzRiOTY5NWQ5NDQ4ODIyZjBkMmI3">The woman on the other side…</p>
<p class="cnNhMDI0YjMwNWI3ODQwYTI4OTg0ZTM1NmRkYTBhNWQx"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZjgwZjFkZGU5NDQxOTg5NDRlYjU3NjRjYmI4Mzg4">Shit she was kinda cool looking. For a Pirate I mean, so not cool at all but lame… Totally lame.</p>
<p class="cnMxOWIzNWE5ZGI5ODQ4ODU4ZDQ2ZjBjMzZmN2YyZGMz"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YzE5Mzk2OWZlZjRiZmViMmEzZTllNjFmOWM4ZTgx">She was totally punk rock. Red hair, slightly tattered clothes but in a cool way, a look on her face of faux confidence. But before I could say anything, she opened her mouth and her jaw dropped for a second and then she said something that I definitely wasn’t expecting.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2I4Yzc1MWEyNjQ2N2M4YjRjMzFlY2E5NzVkZmM2"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYzkwYjcxZTJmNDRhYWJiYTcyODcxMTM2MWJiMzEx">“Grandpa?”</p>
<p class="cnNjYWRiOGViODliOTRkNjdiNzJlZWJjZDM4NDhmYzFh"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZWFjOWIzYTJhMzQ1NmFhOGI1OTM0ODI4MjUyNTRm">“Sinclair.” Hammond rumbled as he pushed into the room, she flinched but was too slow, and he pulled the woman into a bone crushing hug.</p>
<p class="cnMwZGI5M2ZhZjM0MTRmYzg5OTg4YmJhOWIyNzU0MDA5"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNjgxYmEzZTgzZDQxYTg5M2QzNDI5YjBiYmQ5NjY3">She was normal sized, and Hammond very much wasn’t. He dwarfed her and she had no way to resist his bear hug.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDUzNTRlNGVjZDRlNjFhYWRlMzgwZmJmNzM3ZmQ2"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZjczZWM3NDE4YjRiOWViNzIxYWZmY2M3MDUwMDEz">Wait.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDQ2Zjg5OWU2NzQwNGU5YzgyNGIxZTc1MDVhZDVj"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYWI5ZjhlMmEzYzQwNWNhZjhlY2MyZTU1ZDcxMzhh">What?</p>
<p class="cnMxNjE2MzFhMWFlYzQzYWQ5Mjk4ZTM1YjcwOGUyY2Rm"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZGMxZTczMzNmNDQxY2Q4NTdhMzA1NWUzOTUwODE2">I looked on as the two reunited, and I just had to wonder what was going on. Hammond had said a Bounty… If he was trying to rescue family, he should have told me.</p>
<p class="cnNjZGZiY2U2MzlhZjRjMGI4MjYxMjE0ZTdiMTVhZDBl"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NjNiODgwNGU0MzRkMzA4NTQ1NjRkYmQ1YjNlY2I3">Huh. So his granddaughter was captured by pirates and her big tough space marine grandpa had come to rescue her?</p>
<p class="cnM5OWMwNjJmYjkyMTRjOTRhOTZlMzFkYmM4OTM4NmVl"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOTJjNzk3NzZlYjRiYTViNWM2OTY0ZTE5OThmZGNh">That was kinda sweet.</p>
<p class="cnNmOGZkYTRhZjQ4NTRjOGQ4ZjhiMTA5MTg1MTM2YWU4"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZmM4MDAyZjQ4ZDQ3OGU4NzQxM2QzZmI2Nzc5NmU2">Finally Hammond pulled away and Sinclair? Looked up at him, the shock finally starting to melt from her face. </p>
<p class="cnNmYzUwN2ZiMzQ5OTQ4NWRiOWJmODc5YTA4ZTA2NGQz"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NGE2N2M4YWRlYzRkZWZiMjI4YjJkMDFiMTgzZjc0">“You’re here to rescue me? I wasn’t… I wasn’t expecting you.”<br/><br/>“You called for help.”<br/><br/>“To the bounty office, not you!” She hissed and then stopped looking away. “Thanks. I guess that means I don’t have to worry about being handed over to the Securitate then?” She asked, sounding a little hopeful, but then Hammond sort of turned a bit to look at me.</p>
<p class="cnNlODJlYmE5ZTNlNTRiZWNhM2VmNmNjMmQ3ZmQwMDg3"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MjE0MTZiYmIzYTQ4MTM4OWI1NDkzODZiY2FiMmRh">Hmm?</p>
<p class="cnNlYWNjODdjOGNiNjRjOWM4ZGVmMTIzMzJkMzMwMDdk"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZjc3ZGM0NzMyMDQwY2NhNGZkMWM0ODA0ZGQyMzAy">I blinked as I looked between the two faces. Was there something on my face? Did something happen? Why are you looking at me?</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDZmYjJiODA2ZTQ4MzVhNjVhNDY0NjE2YjBlMWJj"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OTVjODE0MGQ0MDRjMmQ5YjdjMDAzYTcwN2NiMTZi">“Captain?”<br/><br/>“Yes?” I asked honestly, confused, and Hammond seemed a bit irritated at my incomprehension.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzM3ZmU2MWNlYzQzYWU4ZDk1OWY0ZjY1MDUzOGJj"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYWQyOTBjZmNkMzRhZTI4ODAxMmM4MTYwZjdjNTZj">Well excuse you! Why don’t you actually say something!?</p>
<p class="cnM5N2Q5MGRlMGU2ODQwODJhYWY5MzdjYzIxMTcyNzgx"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYmI0MDg3ZmZjYzRkYThiNDdiNTRkNGU3NzJlNzM1">“There is still a bounty on Sinclair… I didn’t come here to collect it.” Hammond finally said, turning to face me and standing firm. “I know it’s a grave risk to harbor a fugitive, but she’s my granddaughter. I won’t turn her over to the Securitate. If you can take us to a rogue harbor, we can get off and you can go on your way, or if that’s too much, if you could leave us one of the ships with enough to make repairs.”</p>
<p class="cnMwY2QwYjQzODMwNzQ2YTU4ZDZlMzdkZTU0MzlmZmM5"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOGIyMGJlZDY4YzQyOTU4Y2ZhNjBlZTAyMGU3OWFj">I blinked at him as my realization of this entire situation just shifted.</p>
<p class="cnNhN2JlZWFhNGU1NjQ4ODVhN2E2NzA4YzdmOGU0ZmMy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MGViMjAwYjYyZjQyNjdiNmNmYzZmMzBhZDk2YTNi">Hammond wasn’t working as a bounty hunter, he was just here to rescue his granddaughter that had a bounty… I knew what happened to people that had bounties. </p>
<p class="cnM4NDk5YzhjYjI2ZTQ3NTBiZGUwNzlkOGEzYzcyNzQ0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNjU3OTAzODgxYzQyYmJhNjUxNTNiZThhM2YzZGY1">They were hunted, and protecting them was pretty bad. You could end up getting a lot of attention for doing so, and… She did have a bounty. Was that how he knew she needed help? </p>
<p class="cnNjODExYzE4M2NkOTRjOTY5YmU0OGMxOGExZWVmNDc2"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MzljN2M5MDU3ZjRhNWQ4MmIyNGE4YjJlNGM0NWY3">Jeez this was actually complicated.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDkwMzJkMTNhYzRiNmFiZGJlZmE4NmFlMDc5OThm"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZmNlM2YwMzAyNzQ5NjFiM2JkMjZmZDNjYWVlZWE2">“I’m not really a big fan of pirates.” I offered, trying to work my own head through the situation when Sinclair spoke up.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDg4M2VlMmM2YTRjNTA4MzBmOTQyNzU4YWJjZGQx"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MmU4ZmRlNTNmODRjMjBiYjIwNGFhNjA0ZDNiYTAx">“Neither am I. You think they’re bad, try living with them.” She grumbled darkly, and I took that in. She went still as she seemed to realize she snarked a bit before clearing her throat. “So… You’re the captain of that warship?”<br/><br/>“The Phantom Star. I’m Kat, Well Katherine. Just call me Kat.” I offered and there was a bit of a perking up in her body.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDY2MzhlODU4MTQ4YmI4NzExODcyNmExMDM4NzRj"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYTFiOGFlMjRhNDRmZWVhNGNiOTU1OTAyNTQxZDlj">“Sin.” She responded back, as I looked her over there. She looked… A little rough if you looked close. Her eyes were bloodshot, and she had bags under them. Her hair was a mess… Did this freighter even have a real shower?</p>
<p class="cnMzMDllZDQwZTFmMzQzOWM5OTVkYzJlM2MyMGNlNGY3"> </p>
<p class="cnNkN2RjMTkzNGUwMjRmNTM4YmNlNTJmYjJlMzIxZmJi">Ew. I’m very glad my forcefield is still active, I couldn’t imagine the smell.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTQ4OGNhMjRmYzQ2NjBhOTUyNTBlYTA5M2JkNTYz"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNzlkYmU2ZTZhNDQ1NWZiNmZmNDhjNTY4YWUzMmM0">Her clothes were rough and filled with holes. They might look purposeful, but they were definitely well worn. </p>
<p class="cnNjYjdlYjlmZmNiMzQzZmE5MDdlZjdkMGZkN2JhZWUx"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OTExNWU5MTc0MTQ4M2I4NDFhMTQ2Yjc1ZGUwNmNh">She had on an emergency jacket that didn’t match her clothes at all. The jacket was designed to power a forcefield and such. It was crap. The sort of garbage that ran on batteries and dreams.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDcyNzNlMTk4YTQzZmY4Yzk2Y2Q3YzA3NGMyNDM0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNDI2MjdiNTRjZDQyNTFhOWM1MzIxYmJlNTg5MDVm">“Captain… I know it’s a big ask. I should have brought it up earlier. But just a flight out of here would… Be appreciated.” Hammond finally said and I looked back at him.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDc1NTZmYzhhMDQ0MmJhNGE3ZDkwY2VhM2YxZDI2"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMGRiYWM0MGJhZTQ4MDA5MzNiMDllMTFkZDk3YTZh">He looked stressed. Well, so was I.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTk0ODAyZTkzYTQzMzE5MGFhY2ZlZjEyMGVmY2Mx"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZmI0NTdlOTk1NzRhNDlhMGQxODBkMGYxNWFjYzNl">“Listen… Forget this for now. I want to secure these wrecks and loot what I can… She’s… Your family, and your bounty I guess. So bring her on board, we have extra bunks. We’ll… Figure it out.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNjYzODI2NzM0YTRkMGE5Yzk2ZTY5YzUyMDg4NTZi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNzg4ZDkwMGNkYzQ3ZmQ5Mzk5YTBlMTIwNGQxY2Iz">Hammond nodded looking to Sinclair who met his face and then looked away. “Sure… Can I get my stuff?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDc5YjJhOWM4YjRiNjRhNmQ3NTgwOWRjZThhZWM1"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZjU2NzBkN2FkNzQ5Nzk4ZmFmOThlMmM3ZmE1Yjlh">I hesitated and just shrugged. I turned on my heel and walked away. </p>
<p class="cnM0MDM2YjJjNzdhMTRjODZhZjRhZDQ3YmYyZWY2ZDU0"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NmNmNWM4NTViYzQ5ZTA4MzM2MTJlYzQwY2U1Yjgz">I’d got into a space battle. Been shot at, been looking at dead bodies, and now had my arms full of damaged Crabbit…</p>
<p class="cnM0ODM0ZWI2MWU4ZjQ5Yjg5MTY4ZWVlMzdiMzNmNDBj"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MWVhYWUxMjM4MTQxZjg5MTY3MTY3YmZkM2ExMTJk">There was only one thing I wanted and that was to get someplace safe.</p>
<p class="cnNkYTMzMTA0NDZiNzRlMmViMDc4OTNjMzA5M2QwZjFj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YzEwZWVhZjg2YTQ1NTg4MWZkOWUzOGE3ODE3YTFi">“Can you go out and grab up the remains of the other ship… Unless it’s drifted too far?” I asked the Crabbit in my arms. She tapped at her screen with one of her hands before shaking her head. </p>
<p class="cnM2YzNiZDM2OGFmNzQ4Zjg5MTQyOTRlYWY2MjJhYWE4"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZDVjYzAwM2RhYjQ3Zjk5NDgxYWI1MDU1NDkxMDJl">“Too far.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjAyN2U3MGJjNTRmNmNiNTFiZWY3MWI2NzNjNzVh"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNzIzNjA0NjBiYjQzMjhhZmM0YjZkZmM1OWI4Zjg2">“Uuuu.” I whined because that meant I’d have to chase after it in this sludge.</p>

<p class="cnNhOThlMjg3OThkNTRlNDA4YzY3ZGY1M2JhNTRjN2I5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sinclair Kirkbride</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM2YmFiZjBkNjA2MzRmMDliNmQ2NzYxZWY4OTNlNDYw"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ODBkYzJhZDViOTQ4ODU5MThiMjJkODQ2YjQ5NWRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the fuck.” She hissed as she stared into a mirror. Grandpa… Her Grandpa had shown up out of the blue with an AI warship and rescued her…</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTYyNzcyN2YyODQ5MjBhY2JhZDk3NTEwNTc4YzJm"> </p>
<p class="cnMzODhhMWVhMjk3ZjQ3ZDVhZGExYjQ0OTI1ODQ4ZGNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The same man that had said without hesitation he would put a blaster through her skull when she ran off to join Trent. She’d thought it funny then. As she called him a relic on the comm, the last time she’d seen him fourteen years ago.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTk1YjQ0MDA2NjRjMDE5MWJjZjc4ODVjNjUxOTIx"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YmEyNWRkMmU3ZjRmNDU4YzVkOGExNjllNDIwZThh"><span style="font-weight: 400">But now?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmRkYWMyOTllYTQxNTQ5MjY1Y2M4NTViYWY4Njhh"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNGQ3NTE0ZDU5MTQwMDk4MzVkODRjY2NhMzdjZTY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d sent out the distress message through some tricky routing to keep any of her crew, or worse other pirates from finding out…</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjE0ZDA4N2RiMTRmZDg5ZDU1ZjJmOWRlN2JiMDdi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMDM3ZWVmNGM1ZTRlZGNhNmFkOTg2NjI2ZGRlYjZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">She ran a hand through her hair. Actual hot water, what a fucking luxury. She needed a Klitz to calm her nerves.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjAxYWY2NmU4MzQwMGVhYzA1NDJkYzgzYmIzMWY3"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YWI1ZWZiMTY4ZDRiNGViNDllMjg0YmI0MmE4OTM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">She took the towel that had been supplied warm and fluffy and finished drying off. A few minutes later she was re-dressed enough and stepped out of the bathroom into the hold. She swallowed. She never did get used to just staring out into open space, especially not without a suit and  Forcefield.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MThhODMzYTE1NzQ3ZjI5N2Q0NTI1OGVhMjRjNjMw"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZmNkOTRmMzhkMDQ4YWJhYTdjN2Q1MGRiNzM3MTdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">But what was worse was the swarm of AI floating around. They chattered to each other, and worse to anyone they saw as they floated around.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjU4ZDM1MTVlODRiZjZhMDQzZGNlZGM2MzExOTdj"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello! Nice and clean!” One called out to her as it floated past heading back out of the hold. She shuddered. This was a disaster. Was the AI in control? Who flew around with an active AI!?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGQwMDllNjg3MDQzZGVhOTRlYzUyYjE5ZjA1Yzll"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NDNjZTYwYzUxMzRhM2NhYjNhNjY4OTZmZjZkNDc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet she couldn’t help but stare as part after part was brought floating into the hold by a team of the drones. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjAxMGI0NTJjMDQzNzM5MzM4YmUwZTdiMzA3MWQ1"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NGIzZTZmZGEwYzQ3NDE5OWE2MWZmM2VlMDc0OWE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was part of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Huskarl</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Shield Emitters, and she was pretty sure that part was part of the weapons systems.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmYwYTkxNzIxZjQ4NWFiNzBmNGU2ZGIwNGZmZGM0"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNjc3MTM1NWUwNzQ0ZmFiNDE3Y2YyYjFjMDA2NGYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess having AI to help scrap a ship down was useful.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2VhNDVmNzI0NDRiMmJiZWYyZWE5NDUxODYwN2Fj"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZWQzZDQxY2MxZTQ3OGM4NTE4NTc1MDFhZjM3NDI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sinclair.” A rumbling familiar voice spoke up and she turned from where she was staring to see her Grandpa. Standing a bit awkward and looking like he wasn’t sure what to say.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDQ3YWIxZmIwMjQ1ZTQ4NzYwNWQ4MThiM2NiNjdh"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZDkzZWJhMzY5MjRlZGY5ODEwMzIzNjI3YjUxOGNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah her either. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlODIwZmFhNWJmMDRjYWNiZTQ3MjJkMjhkMjhjOGNk"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZWJiN2MzNTUzMTRjYjNhNzc0YjRiZjJkZTRiZTM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially since all she wanted was to get into whatever room or cell that was waiting for her and just not, for a while.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTY2ZDgzM2M2MzRiOGNhYWU4N2Y4YjY0MWJjMzc5"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MGVmNWMxNWM5ODRiNjViNjc5ZjY5MDdmMDEyZDNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did you even know to come?” She finally spoke, the question that had been burning on her mind throughout the shower. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Bounty… I always kept an eye out for you. I saw your bounty and started searching for you… I had to be the one, couldn’t let anyone else catch you. One of my contacts reached out to me, with your message.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you thought, to just capture your pirate granddaughter?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rescue.” He said instead and she flinched as she looked away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjk2MmZmM2Y3ZDRkNWE4MzEzYzcyN2JlMTg5ZmNh"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYzYwYWYwN2M1ODQyNzI4OTNjZDQ5ZWJmNTVkODc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What happened to a blaster to the head?” She asked harshly, and he stopped looking at her, just as she had stopped looking at him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWIwOWRhOTkxMzRiMzRiYjc5NTNkZmM1OTJkZDlh"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NWQ5NmZlMzg3YjRkZGE4YTUzMzlhOTk5ZGE5ZTJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said that in anger… I’ve dealt with pirates for decades. Couldn’t… I couldn’t deal with my own blood joining them.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah well… How's Grandma? Aunt Cass?” She asked, it had been fourteen years since she’d even… Heard from them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjQyYjNjYzUyYTQxMmRhYjI1NDc0NTAwZDQ2NzVj"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZjNiM2M1NmQ3ZTQ1YTZiY2I5MjJjMTI2ZDE0ZDY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your… Grandma passed. About eight years ago.” He said almost gently. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTYzODhkMTEwMjRhZDY5ZjE2YThjMDkyZmNmYmMz"> </p>
<p class="cnM2OTkyZjY3YjJhYzRiY2E5NmFjYjBjZWQ0Zjc3NDAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuck.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cass is fine. You should call her sometime… The Captain of this boat is… Nice. She’ll probably allow it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDUyYmE1MDc1ODQzNmFiNjU4MWVlMGE3YTJlY2Ex"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYjJhZTQxMTJhYjQ4ZWU4NDg2YjczYWRmNzcyMDk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded and then shuddered as she was reminded of what was going on.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWFmODkwNmU4YzQwNzRhNDg5YjNiODQ1MTkwNTI2"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZDA5ZGI5OTI4YzQzYjViYmIwMGJhNjlkNjgzZGY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s up with this ship? The AI, and the Captain… She’s kinda young looking.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“She is. Not sure. Disavowed Noble maybe. She’s a bit awkward, but a good person.” Her grandfather finally offered. “A bit green, but she’s… Well she flys this thing.” He said while waving around, and yeah that fit.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fucking monster of a ship. When I saw it on the radar I thought I was dead.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDgwZGYyYjI2YzQwMGE4ZWJmNjNhZDdhMzA3MTQ5"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNzhiNTcxNTg2YTQ5YmZhNDk0YTkyYTU2OGE3OWFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You called out though.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well of course I did! This thing would have butchered the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Huskarl</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> just like… It wasn’t a fight.

With the ship I expected?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I made the Phantom Star myself. With a whole lot of help from my Crabbits.” I explained and the Crabbit on my shoulder waved at being acknowledged.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWVmMDMwZDE2YzQ0ODU5NjIyZjhkODVlOWI1N2E3"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MWUyZDdhMTliMzRjZGI4MmIzNzdlYzZiZmY3YTk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then… That still leaves us where we were. We need a Noble.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I know a guy. I could talk to him. I'd probably owe him a favor, but he’s a Baron. He’d be willing… Probably.” I offered and I saw something kind of flattering in Hammonds eyes. Hope.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzVkNmI0YWFkZjRlZWRhMGZjNTBlNzM3NWZjN2Nl"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNjlhMDk1MWRhODQwMDFiYmU4N2I3NDViMTRhMjZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’d do that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… It depends. I’m not entirely altruistic here. Sinclair’s an EW specialist. I’m sort of lacking one of those right now. But… I don’t like the idea of demanding she work for me, if I did this. I mean, we haven’t talked to her, to find out if she would even be willing-”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably something you should do first, yeah.” Another voice called out startling me, as Sinclair came around the corner. She was wearing the same clothes as before, but she’d obviously showered, and wasn’t quite as done up. She looked… Tired to be honest.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjkxYzkwOTQ3YjRiZWFiNDA2NmQxNzIyYzMzYWIx"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MTYyMzhhNTdjNDQ4NjVhYzQ1ZjNkZjRmZTFjYmIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sinclair. Eavesdropping is rude.” Hammond rumbled, but Sinclair despite being in her twenties rolled her eyes like a teenager. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZThjNjYxYmI4NDRmYWNhNWJmY2ZkMWNjMzRhNTVj"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MzdlNjQ1ODE2MDQ5YzZiYmQ4NzYwOGVkNTAwZDQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We haven’t had a chance to talk, and it seems like you’ve been coming up with some ideas.” She offered to me, and I nodded my head. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTZkMTU4MDk3ZTQwMGZhMDc0MDdiM2RhOWJkOTA5"> </p>
<p class="cnM4Y2RhZTNmM2U3NTRjYzI5Yjc4NjM1ZjUwZmMyZGI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right. You did a good job on that other ship. Kept them from jumping away.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s what I did for the last decade.” She offered simply, and I could see Hammond tense at the explanation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjhiNmI2NWNiNTQ4MzNhNjQ0MjMyMDg0MzQwOWFh"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MTcwMjllODNjNjQ1MWZiMDY3YWQ1YWM1YWIyNzUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then… If you could do it to hunt pirates instead, would you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not picky about targets.” She said which earned her no points for me, but she settled against the counter across from Hammond and crossed her arms. “But I don’t want to live the rest of my life on some dirt ball. If you can clear my name. I’ll work for you… Until it doesn’t work anyways.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjA0ZTRjNWVlMDRmMmRiMDVkNWI4MzJmY2RmZjc2"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YjlkNDI5YTNiMzRhMjk5YjQ4MzczZDc1M2M3ZGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sinclair. Be more polite. Captain Katherine is offering you… Your life back.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I’m thankful, but that doesn’t mean I’m swearing myself to slavery here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjNjNmI4MGMyODQ3NDQ4MjRmYjAxZGU1YTkyN2M4"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYmFiN2I3MmE2OTRiNWJhNGM3MmNhNmZhMDljZDAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not asking for that.” I offered and then breathed in and out. “I’ll offer you the standard crew contract. You’ll get paid. You’ll work, and if you want to leave you break the contract and I drop you off.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“And what’s the price then?” She asked, a bit harshly. “People don’t just ask favors from nobles for nothing. That’s a big cost.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve already worked with him in the past. It’s fine.” I said despite it kinda not being.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODc3MjY0MjY5MjRlNTM4YjdhZDUwMWU3ZDU2ZmI1"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNjI1MWQ2MGFmMTRmNWRhYzE5NmM3ODE1MDZmNDNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was this the right thing? She was a pirate, she didn’t even seem all that bothered by the fact. This wasn’t a woman that stopped being a pirate because she saw how horrible her actions were, she did it for herself…</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWI4MzRkYWY5MzRmY2Y4MjExZjA2MThmM2JlOTEz"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZGRhZDgxYWMwYjQwZjJiOGNlZDNhMTYwMTA0NTU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I stared until her eyes caught mine and our eyes locked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWFhODM5YjAwNzQzMGY5ZjZjODFmMTI5N2NmYWNj"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYmY1ZjIyZGQzNjQ0ZDg5ODQ3N2RiM2EyY2EyOWJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked away first. Almost instantly. Was that regret? Shame? Or was she just unhappy about her powerless position right now?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjQzOTBhNGI1MDRiMTE5MDU0Yjk1ZjZmNzk1ZmE2"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">It was impossible to say, the only thing I could do…</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzhhOTE2NTNiYjQ3YTU5YzAyNTFlOTQ5MzE5ZjFj"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YTcxZjEwYzZhNjQ4Yjg4MDQ0ZTM2N2IyZGE5MjBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. I’ll put my faith in you then.” I decided and that earned a look of surprise from the woman.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTA5NDViY2I3NjRlMTRhYzA0NjFkMjczYmQ4NDBl"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NDgyY2Y4YmMzYzRkMTc5Nzk3MjJjMDllYWE3YmE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well there’s no way for me to know for sure if you are really going to be a good fit, or a good person. So I can either turn you away, bring you on and constantly doubt and suspect you, or just have some faith. So I’ll do that. It’s less stressful.” I decided, and shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzI4OTE4N2UzZjRkZDhhZGE1YjIzOTdiNjBkNTMy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMDkwMzgxZTJiYTQwMDU4NmFjZmY4NjVjMzQ4ZDEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s so stupid.” She offered back, and I smirked, because someone that was trying to trick me, wouldn’t have said something like that!</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTFhNzU0MDIzYzRiZTY4MTZmOTY1NDBmNTFjNzdh"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYzI5ZWFlNjI4MjRkZWViZTBhNDg1Njk3YjZmNGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably!</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWQzZDZmYTgzYTRjNGE5OTA0MjA4YWI0YzQ2MzI3"> </p>
<p class="cnM3N2E2MGU5ZGYyZTQwZmM4MzY3YjA3YWQyNTA1ZjY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I need to go find the other ship and scrap what I can from it. We’re going to keep the hull of your ship, and sell it off back home. I’ll be able to talk to the Baron from there.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGE1MWExYjk1NjRkYzhiMzRiM2NkZWU2YmRjNDIw"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NzJlYWJlZTczZTRmNjliZGMyM2NhNWQ0N2QwNmU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hammond nodded, while Sinclair continued to just stare at me with an array of emotions constantly appearing and hiding on her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODY5ZTk0ZDY5ZTQ1MDdiNmJmYTE5MmJmNzBhZjQ5"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZDhiY2ZjMjgyMjQyNzc5Y2YyMGUxYWNkNDBlZWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But before that… We did just finish a big battle so we should celebrate right? Anyone hungry?” I asked, pointing at the protein resequencer and earning myself a bit of a surprised look. “Great, what does everyone want to eat?” I asked before anyone could actually say anything. Some food would likely break up the tense atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGRhODlhNzNmNTQyMTE5MjRjZTIzMmEzMDIyOThm"> </p>
<p class="cnM0OTc2ZjEwY2QzMjQyNzVhZjM0ZjdiNDQ1NDdhZTZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurried over to the protein resequencer, and started it up, slowly getting it turned on and active.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWJlYjViMzBjYzRkNDg4ZTlmOGJkYWZkMTY4MTM2"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MGIyNTcxOGNjNTQzMTJhNjBkZTdjODdkODdiMTM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anything is fine.” Sinclair offered, but Hammond came over and put in his order as well. The fact both of us were setting up the machine got Sinclair interested.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGI4NGFkNDYzYzQ1MTI5MTMzMWFjZjUwNGU3M2Y3"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZThlZDIxZWMyOTQxY2NhMjY3NDIwZjgyYzk3MjYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow. That’s not a cheap unit.” She muttered as she got closer.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTNiMjcxZmUzMjQ2Yjc4NjI1YzQxMDc1YjU2NGFm"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZDc4OGRkOTZhYzQyYjc5ZWJkMzFiZTdlOGU4YTUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope. I splurged on a good one. Good Protein too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“The meals here are good.” Hammond offered to his granddaughter and she seemed to perk up at that. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjUyNDFhMmIyYzQ0NzI5NDlmMWM2OGVmNjI4YmM1"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NTg0N2U2MjhhNzQ0N2E4MTA3ZTMxMmE2NzRiMDMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, you buy high quality protein?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah why wouldn’t I?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe because it’s expensive?” She offered back a little shocked. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2NiMzY5MTc4ZDQ0MWQ5ZTRjOTBhNjI1ZGYwNWQy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MzcwNDVkN2M4ZTQxY2ZiYjcwY2QyNjJjODk2NjJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s really not.” I couldn’t help but argue. “I bought a ton of it when I was first picking up rations. Oh we have some fruit in the freezer. It’s called Vinefruit. It’s pretty good.” I offered and that had Sinclair’s jaw drop a little in shock. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fresh fruit?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… It’s frozen now. But it should still be pretty fresh.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTQxZDk2YmMwNTQ2ZDg5ZmU4ZTVjMDYyMmEzNDVm"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MGIxNjQyYjQ0MDQyNzBhMGMxOTQ4MTg4OTU5OTc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I can just have some?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re hungry you should eat.” I explained simply. And then smiled as the resequencer dinged. “Foods up!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGIyNjVkOWUyMzQ1OGU4OGM1NjYyMjY4ZGI5NTcy"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMmMzNzYxN2E2MzQyOWU4YzViOTZkMjc3N2Y2YWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled as Sinclair perked up at the smell wafting from the steaming plates. I grabbed two and carried them over. I handed one of the identical meals to Sinclair. “Welcome aboard.” I offered, and for a moment she smiled an actual normal look.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTkyMjU3YTE3YTQ2MTRiNDVlYjdiZmY1Zjc1NWFl"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZjM3N2U1OGQzNDQxZmJhODJkYmFiY2M0NzliNWU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2ZmODE4ZTJlMDRmNzI4NDRiMDA5MjYzMTQ2OGQx"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMDEzNmNhZTM0MjQ4ZWZhNWExZjllMzYzZTJhYzUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>

<p class="cnMzZmVmZDQxM2Q2ZTQ2ZmU4ZWU2MDQzZmZhYWQ1NWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a bit hard to have a big crew meal around the mess hall without a table, but that was still on the important things to buy list. But we made do, and Sinclair seemed to actually get used to the whole thing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmEzZjFmZjM0NzQ1NTNiODUzMDQ0NmM2ZTg4ZWQz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNTdhODc3NzEyMjRhNDRiMGFiOTg2MWYwMWIwZjNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">After the meal, I got back to work. Sinclair was still settling in, and Hammond was hovering over her, but that left the real work to me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2M0MmE2Y2RlNjRhNDliMTkwNDVjZjBlMDkwM2Vj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YjdlYjZhMzhmYjQxNzY4MjA0YjQ1YzVmNjQ4MjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which was fine. This was the fun part.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDRlOTAyYjZmMDQ3YTQ5ODIxZTgwN2M1ZjBiZWFm"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NDMxODUyZTRhOTRiZDE5MWZlYjM3OGMwZjcxYWJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay you know what to do?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes yes! Navigation complete!” Chirped the Crabbit and I reached down and stroked her chassis. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWUxMjBlNDUxODRjNWRhZmFjMDMxYzVhMmI0ODgx"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMjVlY2MyMmYxYzQ2ZDlhMmY1OWEyZTYyNjhjMGY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a good girl. We’ll be following you soon, just head straight to UNK-L and send the message once you arrive, but we’ll probably beat you there.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“We can do it! No problem!” She responded excitedly, and I couldn’t help but stroke all of their chassis for a minute.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTlhNmU1MzU1NDRhMGM5ODhkNTBjZDE1YmQ0ZDI1"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YzdjOTQ2MGE1NzQxNWVhYWIyNzAwMGJkNzg1NjEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Five of my Crabbits were taking the Huskarl, and would jump it back to UNK-L while I scrapped what I could out of the ship I’d blown apart.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2VjODYzOWEyOTRjMzFhZTE3MDQzNjdlZWM5NzEx"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZmU4YzhjYTkxMjQ5YjI4NTRjNmU5MWZjMTFhMzQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">It’d be good Creds, and… I already had to head back to UNK-L anyway to talk to the Baron.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTQyMTgxNmU1ZTQwY2U4ZTUwMjkzYTlmZjQzYzQ1"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNTY3ZDQyMWE5YjQwZGRiNmJhNGRhZTM3ZTA0NDAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it still meant I had to leave my little Prize Crew traveling on their own.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWZjZGFhNTliYjQxMTE4ZjdkM2ZjNWQzNzM4ZmYy"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZmYyMWVkYWUwNzQ4YTdhZTczMTMwMjAyYTExYmYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d taken a bit of time to make sure the engines, navigation, and comm system were all functioning on the ship. Although not much else was.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGM3ZTUwZTI0YTQwNzE5MWJhYTUzNjgxNWExMzRm"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NjU2ZjYwMjBjMzQ5ZDg5ODQ5ZDJmOGUxMmJiNjk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still… I didn’t like sending them off on their own. When I left the Crabbits back in the old freighter when I’d left it’d been something I had to do, and it was mostly safe since they were where they always were.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzE2NzQwOTlhMTRlZmU4YTJmMjZmMTBkNjZhNjNm"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZWE2MTg5MzNhMzQ5ODc5OGRjZWY3MGYxMTUxYjE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">But now they were off on their own.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDU2ZmY2MjUwZDQ4OTBiMjFjMDg5ODU4MmFhMjdk"> </p>
<p class="cnMzM2U4NWE0NGQ2OTQ1ODhiNWU3ZGE2YTU2MTRmYWVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. I set up a Tab that’ll play lots of shows, and you can pause and stop it, but don’t get distracted and forget to check on navigation, and don’t watch it all the time. Do something else sometimes… Don’t forget to sync up, so you don’t overload your databanks.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTE4MTliMmI5MTRlNTliZmMzYzg4ZjhjNzQxNzBm"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYzY0OGQ1ZWQ0NzQ0ZjI5NmRlY2Y2YmRkNzgwODZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger roger! We’ll be good girls! Everything Green!” They all nodded at me, and I nodded along with them. I’d picked some of the calmer less rambunctious girls for this. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmNhMTE2NGI1NTQwYTBhYTQzMzI0ZjU1MWZiNGE4"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYmU2ZjQxNjgxOTQ5MTdiNzczZWYzNDM1MGIyZDQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I believe in you. I’ll see you soon.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yay!” They cheered as they floated onto the Huskarl. I hit the switch closing the airlock and disengaging the clamps.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjU1ZjMyZDBmOTQ1YTI5ZjliNTE3MmYyYWRlMDRk"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYjNiMzBhNDVkNDQyN2Y4MTQxYjFkZjA1NmViZDA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were on their own now.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzMDE1YjE3ZTBkMDRlMTZiYzlmOWZkMmQ2MjM3MDVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I landed in the hold with a gentle exhale as I looked behind me. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWY0ZDc1ZjAwOTQ2YmRiYzUyZWQ0ODExN2FlZjli"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MmMxZWQ1NTViZDQzYjQ4NDY4NTA2MDY1ZWZjZmY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hehe! The pirate freighter that I had destroyed had been a gold mine. Even if most of the components on the ship were trashed, some things had survived.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Zjg5MmNkYjkzOTRkNzBhYzliNzg4MzA4ZThjODVl"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMzYwMDVlYmM0MzQ1ZGU5NTQyODY5YmQ0ZTllOTA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The glowing Medium Iris Drive the Crabbit were hauling in behind me was exactly what I had hoped to find in the wreck.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjNlMTlmNGMwMTQ3OWI5MTFkNTUxMTJlM2QwNjEy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NzU0NmViYjg1NDRkOTQ5OWU5NjYyYTkwM2RmMmM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a good find.” Hammond offered from deeper in the hold, although the large man seemed uncomfortable in the open hold. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzNhZTZhNDA0ODRiNGU4MDQ1YzExNjhjOGE2YjEx"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDE4OTQ1YWFmNjRmYmFiMjk3NDNmZjY3MGFkYjcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is! This is worth more than the last few deliveries I did. It’s great!” I cheered as I watched the Crabbits set it down and secure it. “Anything from Sin?” I asked, using the name the former pirate had asked me to use.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWI2ZTZlMzNkNzQ4NDNiNWVmZGYzMDQ1ODljY2Zm"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MzVjZjA3MzRkZTQ0ZTNiMzMwZTk2Y2U1YjZmMDNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hammond looked irritated at the name, but didn’t argue. “She says she has the stash coordinates. We can head there when you’re ready.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Awesome. Yeah I think I got most of the value out of the wreck. Let’s get everyone back on board and head out.” The pirates had an asteroid out in the middle of this nebula soup that they were dropping off all their loot at until they could sell it off to pirate traders.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWRmZTY2NzA0NTQ5MTNiNzE0OGI3NzBlZmVjY2Ji"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMGQxMGU5Nzk3ZjQ3YzU5OGUzNDU5ZWNiMzcxNDdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Funnily enough there was an actual market for trader ships that brought pirate loot and then jumped it a few sectors away to sell it off.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhNjhlOThkNjZkNDQzYzM5YWQxNzBiOTFlMDdkN2I1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’ll take some adjusting, we’ll figure it out.” I said confidently as I turned to make myself something to eat too.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGM0YjdhNzU1NTQ1YWQ4ODg0ZGQ2NzZlYmJjNTBh"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMGVjNWJhMGI1NzRkZWFhOGU3YWQ5YWVjZjk2ODRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Better to eat now, so I can get some work done during the trip. It was going to be about five days to get back to UNK-L.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlY2RlOWRkNGNlNzQxOTY5NTkwMWVlM2FlZWQ5YmE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So… Captain?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTNjZTBmYjE2YjQ1NjQ5MDA5N2MyMjFmMmY5NTcz"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MTkwZWVjMjIzNzQ4YzI4NjExNTZmYmYwYzc2MzU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You always do this?” Sin called out and I just threw her a thumbs up from where I was laying under a chunk from the destroyed pirate ship. I was currently removing part of the ship's comm system.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTEyMGFjNDI1NTRiYWZhZmM4N2YyZDNhOWMzN2Qz"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMzVmZTEyOTYyNzQwYzBiMmNjNDZiYjMzOWQ0YjE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering I needed to upgrade the Phantom’s Comms for Electronic Warfare, I might as well start here. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjYxZDJiNDM2ZjQ4MDI4NWQ0ZjY1NTIwYTQ5ZjM4"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYTIwYmFiZjZjMjRjZjhiNjA3NjYzMTBmOTg5ZGE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright!” I chirped as I had the Crabbits pull me out, and I was able to remove the comm system from the hull, watching as it started floating thanks to the Crabbits. “Well she’s a bit roughed up, but I can fix it. And upgrade it.” I decided, seeing the Antennae-like system with the long sensor panels sticking out from it as well. Where would be the best place to install? On top of the bridge?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTE5ZWEwMmIzYzQ5ZGU5OTc2N2YzNTA1MWMwOGY3"> </p>
<p class="cnMyY2ZhYmViMjI0ZDRiOTdiNDFhM2Y2NGY5ODcyZWY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that wasn’t any good. I still wanted to install some point defense systems that would overwatch the top of the ship. There was the frontal section just under the bridge that would work.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzMzYjA3MjE3ODRhODc4NWYzZTQwMGNmMmRiMTZi"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MDRhMWIyMGNmZTQ4MDA4NTgzNjcwZjU4Njc2YjJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">No better to split this into two actually. Or even three. I could upgrade the sensors with the sensor panels, and then add a bit more to the comm unit?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTY4MTRlZGZhNDRkMGQ5NGUyYzg0NzVhMjkzNjk0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZjFmMjk5ZWVkYjQyMGZhYjMxZGI5MWU0ODZhNDQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">No better to keep the sensors with the comm so it would have a faster connection for the EW system.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjkyOTc5Nzg3YTQ3YzI4ZjA1OGJiNzI3NTA1MmRm"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NDM2M2EzNDBlNjQxOTY5MmRjNmMzZTg4NzBlNTRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You really get lost in this stuff huh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I blinked as I realized that Sin was still there. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTUzOGZlNDEwYjRjOWQ5YmQ4NmZlMTI2MWYzZDA4"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMmE2ZmFiNTg0NzQ1YmQ4NWFlZmI4ODg2OTZkNGNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s what I like to do… Do you need something?” I finally asked her directly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2MwMDBhOWEwMjRmODk4YWQxZDgzOWNhMDRmNzgy"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YjcxNzE4Nzg1MzQ3YjRiZjRhZWY1OWJiYTJkMjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mostly just getting a feel for things.” She offered shaking her head. “I’ve mostly just been sitting on my ass and taking a nap for the last twelve. You got a work rotation, or something? Feels weird not to have something to do.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmFkYWQ0YmFhMzQ1OTM5OTYxMzFjNWZkYzk4MGI4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0OWE5M2Q2ZWIyNjRmZTk4NGY2MjhiYjMyNGMyMzMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really.” I told her honestly. “But if you want something to do, you can give me a hand here. I’m grabbing sensor and comm parts from this to upgrade the ship.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“This junk?” She asked, looking at me skeptically.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzhmNDZlMDk2ODQwYWNiMTgxMGRhMDMyM2Y4MzIy"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YzhhZWY3NDk0MjQyM2E4OGIwMTU2YWUzOTUzMmQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the antenna I was still half holding despite it being floating thanks to the Crabbits.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTJkZDFlNDY0NjRhYTJhNWU3Nzc3ZmJjODI1NmQ1"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MjA1ZjdhZjU5YzQ1ZmNhMTQwNjMxZmVmYjAzZjdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure it was a little busted up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODg2Y2MyMmRhZjRhZGRiZGYzMDI4ODc1ZjZiMzVl"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNmE2M2RkOGRmMDQ4NTk4ZjdiN2QzZjNhYTRkZjZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is good stuff. Only minimal damage, easily fixed, it’s solid. These sensor panels are actually pretty good. Not standard for sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pretty sure those came off a Nebula scanner… Uh, the corps send them out into the murk to find patches of gasses they need.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That would do it. Yeah these are nice sensors, better than the stuff I have installed. I’m tempted to strip the sensors off and just do a minor Comm upgrade, but if you’re sticking around, it’ll be best to configure the whole thing as the EW array.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a lot of system for just the electronic warfare suite.” She said, sounding confused at my response.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGY3NmZmMjllOTQ5ZmY5YmY1YzFmZTJiYjM4ZjI5"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMzVhYzk1NzBmNzQ2Y2VhNmQ1NGM4YTRhMTcyMDYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really? The higher bandwidth and accuracy you have the more effective you’ll be.” I countered and she nodded, still looking a little confused. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGE5YzNlZGY4ZTQwMWE4NGQ2ZTQ0NDU1NzE0ODI4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDUzOWIxNzA2YTRkMGM4NWEzNWFlOWEwNDU4MzE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I guess I’m just used to a more relaxed budget.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged at her response. I don’t see how a budget had anything to do with this considering the parts were free, but I shrugged it off. Time to get to work fixing it up for the install. I’d have to wait until we left subspace to do it of course.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTYxYjAzODAzYTQzODk5MjU5ZWRiYTQxYTQxYzky"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYmE0ZTE1YjQxMTQ1MmY5Zjk0OWE5MzIxM2YyYzlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGYzNTJmYTQ1MjRjMjFhMDFkZGIyODM3ZjE0N2Jh"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZDE5Nzg5ZjE3YjQ2MmU4YTAxY2RhNTI2ODJhN2E2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I spent hours working, fixing the parts I found and happily prepping them for installation. Then once I had everything sorted for that I grabbed a string of shield emitters hefting the parts up in my arms straining a bit despite the Crabbits helped as I maneuvered the large roll of parts.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDg2OTViZmNhMDRmOTJiOTM1ZGJhYmI0MGI2MDVh"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NTMzOTg2ODI3ODQzYTA4OTgwMzFlYjlmNTcyNzE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sin disappeared suddenly when I called my helpers and I shrugged as she rushed off as I headed out of the hold with the Crabbits following after me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzQ0ZDA0NzM3YTQwYzNiNmE5OGI0NTc1MjdhNDgz"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YzAzNTlmZjZkNDRhNDlhNzA5OWQ0ODUyOGM2ZDNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran into Hammond as I moved through the mess, the man was bleary eyed, obviously just waking up as he stood in front of the drink maker, obviously getting some coffee.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDIwNjIwZDE4ODQ0ODliMzUxZDBmOGViNjAzNzk5"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYTQ3ODIzMTc0ZDQzY2Y4NmQ1NGJhNTlhMTAwMjdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning!” I greeted and he nearly flinched as he looked at me with eyes that seemed confused for a while before he nodded and grumbled something.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODlmNmRlYjIwYzRmYTY4ZDYwYWNlYTQzMDk4NzA5"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMDNjMWFjY2IwNzQxOWQ4MjdjYTRiMzNkZWI2OTA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued hauling the shield emitters to the workshop. Entering in and dropping the very heavy parts on the side beside my workbench. There wasn’t much else I could repair while in subspace, so it was time to do something else. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyODIyZjkyNWUzNjRjMWRhZDBiNGFkYTRhNGQyNTZj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NDNlMjA1YWVkNzRiNmVhZTdhYTBhYzYyMzE1M2Uw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath, no more half assed solutions. “You ready for this?” I asked, and the horde of Crabbits excitedly cheered all around me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODMyZWQ1YWM4NjQ2YjA5MGIwYWUxNTE3NWMzNTAw"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NzRjMzJmM2VmMzRmZTE5NjEzZWZmYmRjOGZjNzcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! We can do it! You can do it!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhmm! Captain can do it!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yay! I want upgrades!” That last one was spinning in the air cheerfully enough it almost made me dizzy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWY0MjU1OTQ1MjQ1YjVhZTgxMzk2ZTAyYjc1MzYy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYzY4OWZhYmRiMTQ2YTVhNjM4MGIyMDZlZjI2ODY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright then, I’m going to need all of your help here.” I looked at the empty workbench, and opened myself to the song. As always this deep in subspace it sounded odd, but the Phantom Star was there. Her Metal undertone thanks to the Diamond Drive was muffled thanks to the bass line of a demanding march.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGY0ZjcwZWQ4NTRmZmFiYmU4YmE2ZThiZWM1ZTRl"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNTRkMGE0MDE1OTQxZTNiMGUyOWIzN2Q0NjU1MzM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d grown well. Her song had changed with every part, every connection. She was an endurer now. A promise in my ear that no matter what she’d face she’d endure and keep going.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTljYjc0MjZhODQ3MTk4NGM4MGMzMTFiMTM2MjJi"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZmZhNTk1YzFmZjRkMThhMzE0Zjc4ZDBiOTQxNDJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was my home, my tool, and my mode of transportation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTMyNWY2MjQ5NTQwMGNhMTZmYzU3MDI0MWU5ODAx"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNGQ0NmU3ODA2NTQwNzM5NTUwODBmNjIxYmZmYzlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bring me some nanopaste. I’ll need some high energy cords, and some of the Iris Drives from storage. Just bring everything and we’ll figure out what we need.” I called, and the Crabbits went at it, buzzing away cheerfully as I pulled up the shield emitter and grabbed a tool. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTc0ZWVlMzViODQ4NjVhZDc2OTliNmI2NzQ1Y2Zh"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NzgzN2YxY2MzYjQwNjc5N2Y5ZTE1YTk3NjJjYTUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I bent in and popped one of the emitters free, and then started disassembling it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDRmM2RiYzMxNzQyOTM5MDVjZjQ0YmM4N2RkNWQ3"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MWNlZWY5ZjhhMDQ5Zjc4N2YxNDFiYzQwZDU2Mjhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjYyMDI1MWUzZDQ4N2RiZTkzMjExOGU1ZjExNmU4"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZGFjODk1ODA1NTQ1MGY5NmNiNjYxZTgyYWQ2Mzll"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact was I needed something that could be used in two very different environments. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmU5NzVmZGMxMDRlNzM5ODk3ZTM2MTNiOTFiMmY0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NzE1NzA5MTAyNDRmMjM4YjgwODJiNjhkMzMxYjcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Personal shields were very rare out on the frontier, part of me wanted to ask the Baron when I saw him if I could disassemble his to find out how it worked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTM1OGNmZmJjYTQ2NzVhMjEzMGUzOTlkNmMyZWI2"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZWQxY2Q4N2U2MjQzMGJhM2RlZjQwMTU5MjAyYjY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably a bad idea… I’d do it anyway.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Nzc2MGIyNjc1NjRhZjU5YjkwNmNhMGI4YWQwMzI4"> </p>
<p class="cnM5OGUxOWE2MWZiYjRiMWI4ZDZjODVmYzUwM2RmMTMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">But for now, even if it would only work in space, I needed more than a shield that would blow up in one hit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzc2ZTUxODgxYzRhODQ5NDg2MWI4ODE5YTg5ZDJj"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNjE1ZGU5NDMzZjQyZmY5ODMyYTcyNDYyMDUzYjJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it wouldn’t be the last time I faced space pirates, and I had nearly gotten shot. I really didn’t want to get shot, it was scary!</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmUyYzZlNzgzMzQ2ZTRhYWYwNGYxZWVhOGJhMDQy"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMTUyYzRjMWM3YTRhMGM4Y2RmZDA3NmUxNzMwYTk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. That looks better.” I muttered as I pulled away from the wiring. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDViOTU2Mzk5NDQ1OTM4MTgzMTcxZDVlOGE4YzJm"> </p>
<p class="cnM3M2E3ODcyY2M2NjQ5OGM5OTA4ZmU0ZjI1OTNmY2Ri"><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d thought about keeping the shield module as something the Crabbits could just always have with them, but that ended up with the exploding issue. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjdhNzdhOTUwOTQ3Y2ZhYjhlZmM3OGU0OGRlOTcz"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZmRjOTQzNGRhOTRkYzFhNDEzNmQ5MzJlMDYyZTU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The emitters I had on hand to create shields were too big, the quality too low. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTlkODE4NDI3NjQxYTk5NDVmZWFhNGExYzVhMGRl"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMWMyY2Y5MTA1YzRjYTNhMmRhNGU4MDlkM2U1M2U1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Could I make my own emitters of higher quality and miniaturize them? Maybe if I wanted to spend a few years to manufacture, the equipment to manufacture them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2Y1MzRkODNkMDQ5YWY4NWY4MDhlMWE4YzFiNjA4"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YTJjYmI1ZmFjODQ4Yjk4NzNmMjljYjZhYjBkNGUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like the issue with the focusing arrays. If I spent the time to make the tools to make the tools to make the object I could make something better, but that was a lot of time, especially when I could just buy what I needed instead.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzBhYTMwNDNmZTRjMmM4Mjk5Y2JkNDk2NzBlYzAx"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZmQyYjc5NjNkZjQwMDJhNmIzYmFiOTQwNDNiNTQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well usually. The war made trying to buy war material a pain, something I was trying to avoid.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGJkMzA5NGYwZTQ4MjY5ODYyNmY1ZTU0ZGVhYjU3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmN2IxMzBjMjNhZjQyNTY5NjUzNjdhNzliNmMxNWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked it over. The song sounded good, made no sense for it not to. I’d gone over this thing over and over, and at the end of the day, I’d gone for rugged simplicity.</span></p><span class="cmM1OWNhMjdkNTQyMjRhZTlhODNiOTg0ZTc1MmExNWQ3"><br/>This text was taken from Royal Road. Help the author by reading the original version there.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNiYWU2ZjczODNiOTRjYzM5NzE0NzViZjY2ZDBlZTE5"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZDU2N2ViOGU4NDQxYTNiMzllZWIzNTZiZDJkZDJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright girls.” I called out, and the two Crabbits floated down and locked into the object on opposite ends, and it rose up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODc2NjFlMjY2YTQzMDQ5NTlmZGY1OTNmMjAzZjEy"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMjhmZDlmMTUxNTQ1NTVhMjc5NTg1YTBhNDBiYWYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well even if it didn’t work I could still hide most of myself behind it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTc3ZjA4NzQ1MjQ4NzU4NGE1OGU2ODFjOGZjYTZk"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYTVhMTgwMTE0YzQyOWZhNGUwMjBhMjMzMzcwYzdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the Iris Drives, stuck into the object. The Crabbits drives just didn’t have enough power on their own, so instead I’d made a completely separate module.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDQ2NmYxNTk0MDQ3NDRhYjNiMDMwYzczOTdlOTc2"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNzk1ZjNmZGFmYTQxZmJiZGJlYmNjMzI3MDlkMjI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sudden urge to turn it on struck me and I shook it off. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTc1MzEzZGEwMDRkNWU5NDJhY2M0NzAxOWM0NDEy"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay let’s move to the hold, and see if it works.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yay! Yes! We’ll be your guards now!” The two cheered at me, and I couldn’t help but smile at their happiness at getting their own special job.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjQ1ZTU5OGY1ZDQzODA4MmQ2YmJlNGM4Mzk4M2I3"> </p>
<p class="cnMxN2Y4ODUxODFjNjRjMjA5MWQyMjc3YWFlNzQzMTM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right. I’ll rely on you two.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeee!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aww.” I heard behind me and saw the other two of the former shield formation. I’d decided to only use two Crabbits instead of four for this, so I did feel bad. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTg0ZjgzMDk3ZjQ3ZDJiMGEyZDJhMzA3YTAwNjli"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NGVjYmZkOGZmZTQ1OTA4ZTgxYjRhZDQ2ZWEwYzBh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crabbits loved having their own job, it made them proud. They’d often puff up and tell others how important they were.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDhhMjgzZjFkNDRkOGViMjk5YzgxYzY3MzdjNTMw"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNjQ5NmU2ZmY2ZTQxZTE4ZWUyNzFmNzMyZTQ5ZWM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. I haven’t forgotten you two.” I told them and winked. Which cheered them up substantially.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDQ4OTg2MWI2YTRkN2JiZWM0NmE5ZTBmYmVjOWU4"> </p>
<p class="cnM3N2YwMjAwMTFkMTQxMTZiNGQxMTNmNTU3ZGIyMjRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I’d need something to cover my back too.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjA3MjM4MjYwNjQ5ODFiNDY5MTU0ZmE1MTEyM2Iy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZmVjNWE1NTgyMzQwMWU5YzQ1MjMzNDU3ODhjOTY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I yawned as we headed out of the workshop and down into the hold, I didn’t see Hammond, or Sinclair but that was fine. Once we were down the Crabbits moved to where I pointed and then I nodded as I stood all the way on the other side of the hold.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmE3MTYyMTgyNTRkOWE4ZGViNmQ5OGJkNDI3ZWFk"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMWZjNGE1ZmVmZjQxZjQ5NmMwM2IwYmU2MjQxMGE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Activate!” I called out and ducked my head. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTA1ZTcxOGU5NzQwZjk4MGE2YzgxOWVjZjc0ZDkx"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNDBkZDA5ZGNkNzQwNmI5OTJjMmE4Mjg0ZDkxZTIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Just because I was confident it would work, didn’t mean I was stupid.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzQ5MjE3ZTZiNzRmN2Y4YzRmNzA0Y2U1ZGJkMjM0"> </p>

<p class="cnM5ZDZiODNiNTg0NzQ5ZmM4YzlhNDJiMzUyMTIxYjI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was… Well a shield. Six feet tall of shaped metal tapered towards the top and bottom, and sort of diamond shaped. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2Zjc5ODIxZWViODQ0YWJiN2UyMGU2NjM0NzU1Nzk5"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZGZhZTA0NzhjODQxNmNhY2JjNjllZjliODU3YzU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a shield. A literal piece of metal shaped as a shield. Inset into the center on one side was a jury rigged shield emitter with the output set about four feet in front of the shield. That alone had taken hours to get right so it didn’t just burn out.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGZjYmE5MjRkMzRmOTZhOWJmYTQ3N2FmYjJhYmZk"> </p>
<p class="cnM2OThhN2Q1NDU3NDQ4YjA4MmJjZjRiODBjMjA5MGM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then on the back side was a power pack with the glow of Iris Drives glittering. Mostly Tiny drives, but there was a small one inset as well.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODJkZmJjNDQ0OTRiMzg4YzY0ZjNjMWE5MDY2ODBi"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOWY3NGM4OTg3YzQ1NzVhZjlmZTQxZDRmMzljMDUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">That had only barely been enough power to keep the emitter going at a very low level, but I wasn’t dealing with capital ship weapons. It was more than strong enough to stop infantry weapons… Probably.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxOWU2MmRkNjUxMzQ2MzdiMzllNjY1YjhiNTdlMmEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was… Big, bulky, rugged, and not at all like the personal shields like the Baron has. No, but it would let me stay alive, especially once I finished the second one, and could literally enclose myself while traveling down ship hallways with shields on each side.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlMTAzODJlZTY4MjRjMmE5MDRmNjE4MzcxZTRkZjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crabbits were sitting on the ends of the bar, and obviously using the Gravity Plate to make it heavy as Hammonds arms that were thick and corded were obviously straining as he lifted the bar up and then down. And then he dropped it, causing the bar to bang into the floor making a loud noise.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmM3YjgxNTgwZDQ1MWVhNzk5YzM5ZTk5MTRiOWY0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNjMxMDYyZWIwODQ2NjQ4OTNjNDc3ODViOWMyMThh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully the Crabbits had been quick to cancel out the gravity so it was just the sound of a metal bar landing on metal, and nothing was denting my floors.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4NWRmMjQ4MzI1MTRkYTBiMzc1OTgzYzhmMjYxMjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, that’s… We’ll figure out a better place to exercise, because I was sleeping.” I grumbled rubbing my eyes again. </span></p>

I wet my throat as I watched Hammond continue a routine. He grabbed two smaller metal bars, and the Crabbits rushed over to grab onto the end of each one. The two Crabbits hanging cutely from his hand as they giggled as he started doing a sort of jumping jack routine.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1MjhmMTM1MmIwMzRlYmRhOGZlYzkwMzM0MTdhNzAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoa.” Aunt Sheila muttered as Hammond stepped through the airlock and onto the floor of UNK-L. The massive man looked around a bit curiously as he took in the sight of everyone crowded aroun d,e</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDZmMGM3MGViNDRlMzlhZjAwMzk4NDQ0YjE1NTk0"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MzdmZTI1N2FiMzQzNmM4YmI3OGE5OTg3NjkyMjE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh um.. Hammond, this is my Mom, my Dad, and well everyone. Everyone this is Hammond Kristler, a Bounty Hunter I picked up as a crew member.” I explained.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmVlNzhmYjVmMzQ1OTRhZWY1YmJhMWYxYjc4YzBi"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YWEyNjQ0ZjgxZDQxNjhhMzk5NzMzZGQ3ZTllMDg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hammond stood up fully and offered a Kenish Salute. “A pleasure to meet you all.” He offered before looking to me and there was something in his eyes. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjhmMWI3OTMwODQ4OTBiMmVkZjc4MGNlYTJlMjg2"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMmVhOWVmMGY5NzRhZTJiYmRkODdiOWFhYjEyMzM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. The Baron isn’t here right now, but let’s take a bit of leave?” I offered, knowing it was pretty common to let your crew relax when you docked on stations.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmRkODExOTA4MTRhYTNiZWIwNjdlZjg1MDAzZWM3"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZmNkOTBmNDI5ZTRjOTBhMjUxNDg3MTllMGRlNDEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hammond looked pleased and nodded offering a greeting to Dad, that he returned. Real man energy between the two. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzRiMjAyZWRjNzRiOThiYzE1OThjOTEzN2VjZTU3"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYTg1M2ZmZGM3YTRmNTRhYmM3Yzc1ZjczM2MwMDk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You found some crew huh?” Dad spoke, sounding proud and suddenly I was squeezed again. “You’re growing up Kat.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is another matter.” Suddenly Uncle Kyle cut in. “I’m told you are looking to sell the other ship your drones delivered?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep!” I chirped smiling happily as Uncle Kyle looked more than happy as well.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhNmNiOTFlMDE2YjRjMzc5YzhmODM1MGI3N2RkYmE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Great. Now just had to haggle with my Uncle that does this for a living, and then somehow find the Baron.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkMTE0YTA0NTg2MTQ4NjA4YzA5MzMwODZlOGRhMDUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I dropped into the Captain's chair with a sigh of relief. Looking out the window I could see UNK-L. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmY3ZmE2YzgyNjQ2NGE4ZGJkMzA1MTc4MDBlZjJj"> </p>
<p class="cnMzOGExNzUwYmEzMDQ5MjViMTYzMzcwZmMxZmZjMTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was nice to be back, but there was also the problem of everyone wanting some of my time to hear about my travels.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODkwZGY0ODE4MjQ4MmJhYjAyODUzMDJhMjc1MmVi"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZWUzYjVhY2JlNDRlZWViODFlODYwMWRjZmE4MDg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">It hadn’t even been two months! I wasn’t telling them about my adventure on Starks Point! That was embarrassing!</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmUyNzAzMDUxMDQwMTU5NWJkNjQyNmM1ZGJlNmJm"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNzE3NTk3MDQzYTQ0MGE5YjJiNzVkMDQ4OTZjNjNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran a hand over my face and hit the comms unit. I’d set up a connection to the comm array on UNK-L and it was time to make a call I felt… Complicated about.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Nzc3MDRiMGMxNzRmYzU5MDkwYjVjNjQ4ZTAwNTlk"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZGNjM2IxYjdkNjRmMTc5MjMwMmQwNWQ1YzRlMGU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">But I’d sent out a request, and gotten a time for the call.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWMzZjI0ODBhNjQxOTI4MmIwNzlmNWNmNDJhNDQz"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YTViMjU0NzNhODRlMTJhMTU0NzkyZTAyZjViMTU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I sent it out and only a minute after the channel opened.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDVjYjQ4YTc3OTRiZGQ5MjEyZTRiZGFiMzE4YmNh"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNTBiNjJlOWE1MjQ5MTk4YzNlNmI1ZmJiMGYwNjQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Katherine. A pleasant surprise, to be sure.” Baron Cyger Ritz offered with a smile. The man to my surprise was hatless showing off his coiffed back hair, as he lounged in a chair with all sorts of trophies and things behind him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDAyNGE5YTIzNzRlY2E4YzVhY2E1MGZjOWE5YTQy"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MjRlMTZmZGQ0ODQzMTBiMTdmMmVjZTM2ZTViNzRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Baron. Thank you for taking my comm.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh it’s nothing. When I was moved away I feared it might be some time before our paths crossed again. Tell me, how were your travels?” He asked, switching to small talk which surprised me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDExNGZkZTA4MTRiNDI5Mjc1NDA1YTRmZTgwMmQz"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMjQwOTkxYTE2MDQxZDY5YzQyODE4MzM1MmUwZjU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, uh, it was eye opening.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Profitable?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh yes. I just delivered a ship to UNK-L for scrapping. I’m doing well.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent! I’m glad to hear it! My own time has been mostly travel so far, but things are becoming quite exciting, but I don’t wish to hold you in suspense. You wished to speak to me about a private matter?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded, a bit uncomfortable, but… This was for Hammond, and Sin of course. “While dealing with some pirates, I ran into a situation. One of the pirates was… Well she assisted me in taking over both ships from within. She’s on the pirate registry though.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I see your problem clearly. You need someone with a Noble Rank in order to clear her name?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. That’s why I’m calling you. I don’t know the sort of price it would be, but you’re the only Noble I know.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Easily done.” He said, waving his hand as if it was nothing to be concerned with. “Send over her data, and I’ll have Artemis take care of it.” He offered with a wave of his hand. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGNiZDYwNWUyMzQ2MjNhODExNTZhMmI5YzJhZjE5"> </p>
<p class="cnNmN2JhNDllMWU2ZDRjZmJhZDYyNzhkYmY5ZWRmMWEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a simple matter for someone that I consider an important friend.” He said, and his words were matched with an open smile. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDk4YzNmMjM0MzQ3MDA4MTZiNDYzZTkxNDM5OTM0"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZWY0ZWY1MTJiMDQ4NDM5NzcyZTdkY2U2MWNkYzVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately it only made me more uncomfortable, because I knew what he really meant was someone he wanted working for him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmQ5YTc5MDY0NDRkZmE5NzA5M2IyZTc2NmVlYzA2"> </p>
<p class="cnMzOWVjOTA0N2VmYzRmNDVhNDI5OTA4NDAxMmRmYWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.” Was all I could say though. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDI0ODk2NDdmYTQ5NjBhNDkzOGUyMTRiYzVjZTIx"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MDZlNjYwZjA2YzRjZTQ4ZmYzNTA5MDNlNWFjNzU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good! Then that matter is resolved. There is another matter, are you interested in future work?” He asked and I felt the trap close in on me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmI0ZjBmZDdhNDQzYjZiZjMwNmY0Y2Q0MzkyY2Zl"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMzU2MDBkODBhNzRlNmY5MzMzMWVmY2U4YzZiMjlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m in between jobs. Right now.” I had to admit, which earned me a smile, that reminded me far too much of a cat catching the canary.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWQxMGQxYzgwZjQyZWQ4MjJlZjQ2NmQ0ZTlmY2Fm"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNzZhZmQ3OWNiYzQxNjg5NDZhZmNjMTY0ZWFjZjAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It will be some time. I can’t say much over an unsecured line, but the Octavius has been moved closer to the front lines. There is something coming up in the future. Something big, something that could earn us both a much brighter future. Can I at least be confident you’ll hear me out when the time comes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTBkYjAwYzRhZDQ2Y2U5MzhjZTE2NDJlOGQ3Nzcy"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYzE2Y2MzYjM5MDQzYmNiY2UwNDIxODA0NzI2MzIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I swallowed a little dryly. Of course I could refuse. If he was moved closer to the front line, then he was definitely talking about a wartime action…</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2VjYjZiYmJhZTQ5NTVhMjYxZjA4MTI2MTk3NjFj"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNzJiOWY4NGFiMzRmM2E4ZTNkNDM0ZjZhMjVjNGI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d… I’d like to hear what you have in mind. I have to worry about my ship of course. I don’t like the idea of getting close to the front lines.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. I’ll send you a meeting time and location, when plans solidify. I promise you Katherine, you won’t regret joining me for this. I would also consider it a favor, even for simply hearing me out.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTVmYThjY2RjOTRlOTdhN2I4MTQ0YzExNDhiODYy"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMGRkYWFmN2E1MzRmOGU4MDQ1MzEyYTgzYjNjNGYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand.” I said, not entirely agreeing, but… I would hear him out. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDFjMTA5YzYwNzRiNDRhOWI1NWE4OWEyYjg3ODc4"> </p>
<p class="cnM0Y2VhMGJjZDU1ZjRhYmY4ZDM3YjYxNzdmM2ExZmY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent! Send over that Pirate’s data and her status will be restored as a normal citizen, and I look forward to speaking to you again face to face.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you again.” I offered and the comm line was cut after the Baron offered a Kenish Salute.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmIxNTA1OTQwZTQzZmM4OTMxZjEzYjhkYWY0OTE2"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NDdkMWE5ZTEwMTQxZmZiYTVlYzg0YzMzMjk3MTRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well… That was a thing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWE1NTU1ODE5MzQ2MDE5YjI1NzUzZjU5ZDJmZDFj"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MDNjZGUyNDQ0ZDQ0MmM5ZjU2NzdmN2IzMjNmOTIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly sent Sinclairs data through the comm and just… That was it. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTczNTE3YzNlZDQ1NjliYTI3ZTc0NzBlZjNlMDNi"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MWVlNGVhNDAxNTRiN2RiYjI5ODJjYjg2MDdhN2Ez"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGU0MmY2ZjE5MzRiZjZiYmM3ZDA1YTllOTRjNTQw"> </p>
<p class="cnM4M2IwZjQwNjg0ZDQwYzhhYzU5ZjlmYzhkZGRmYjI3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Sinclair Kirkbride</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiMTEzYzc0NjJkNjQyOTNiMzk0MDZhZjM5ZDY5MjBm"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZTdlMzI3ZDdlMTQ2YTVhYmU1MGNlZDk1ZDRlYzU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">At least the room was big. Sin wasn’t about to head off the ship while still registered as a pirate, that was asking for someone to do an ID scan and suddenly everyone is shooting to kill.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTAzNjk2ZGI0ZDRmNjI5MjUxZDk3OWFiNDUzZDk5"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MDM0Zjc3YWY1MDQ2MDc4YTEzNDIwYzFlM2M3Mzc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead she was wasting time away watching stupid videos on her Tab. One benefit to being at a normal station was access to the Subspace Relay. It had been a long time since Sin had been able to just browse and update everything.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjk3YmFkMmNiNTQwMGY5NmY5ZWEzMGMxZGUwMTFj"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NmQ4ZGIyZjQ0MTRhYzBhODkwZGRhMmU1YTgzMWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh. A new season dropped. Nice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjJhYjc0YTdjYzQ2YWM4YWU0Y2RlMzZiNjliYWI0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYTQwNWZhYWQ0ODRjMGQ4ZmE4YjBiMmRlNjUzM2I3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of a knock startled her and she sat up glaring.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGQzNTQ3MDg1MzQxMWFhNGViM2ZlNGM0MWIyNGY2"> </p>
<p class="cnMwOGVlNjkxYWQ3OTRkYmVhMDZiYmFmYTkyYmI4MjNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not playing hide and seek you-!” She cut herself off. Don’t call the insanely terrifying free AI names Sin.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDJlOTUxN2Y3MTRhODI4NGRlNjMwODRhNDllZjBi"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMDI2YjU1OTI3NDQ4NjJhMDIwOWYzMjY1NDdiNzJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was quiet for a moment.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzQyYTMyZjdiZjRjYTA4ODg3MDUxMDc0MjAyYmQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m glad, cause I’m not really looking for a game either.” The voice on the other side of the door wasn’t those terrifying little shits.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWM4NjkwOWIxODRiZTk4ZTg4NTg3OTc3ZWFkMDg4"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MGY5YzljNTBmMTQ0MDhiOGIyOGVjYzczNTk2YjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">She sat up and rose for the door opening it to see the large form of the Captain. Looking up she met her eyes and quirked her eyebrow as the big woman sort of glanced away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGNmYjE5ZjI3MDRhZDY4M2Q5MjVjZjEyYjYyNzg2"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NmE5OWE3ZGU0ODRjZDBiMTJiMzMyNmJhNGQwNTYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to bother you.” She suddenly said, refusing to look anywhere at her. Sin looked down. She was wearing a fucking bra, and panties, the fuck was wrong?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTgzMGI0OTE4ZTRiYWZiMThjOGJmNjYxYzI0Y2Q1"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZTQxYmIxODk2ODRiZjg4Y2JiZWNhYmM1NmQ5MjNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine I was just downloading some shit… You need something?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, actually.” She pulled out her Tab and then hesitated. “You have your Tab?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.” Sin grumbled walking back to the bed and grabbing it waving it up in the air. A moment later it chirped as the Captain flicked her Tab.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjVkZjgxMjM3OTQ3ODE4ZDVlNjQ2NzUzODJmNjUw"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYjk4Y2I4Y2QzNTQxMWQ5NjBhMzJlMzUwNTg1N2Fk"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was going on? She looked at the Tab at the updated file. Rolling her eyes at the complete lack of security, as if she would just open some random ass fi- Was that a Citizen Registry file?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjcxOGZjZjYwYjQ3OWZiNDMwMmI5ZGZhYjRmMGFj"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">She opened it instantly, and then stilled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWViMjVkZDE1YTRmMDE5NWYzOWI5MzIyZDkyYjlk"> </p>
<p class="cnM2Y2QxMjkwNTE5NjRkZDI4NDQyNmRjMmQ5MjQxZDE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bullshit.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjVjYjFhODY0NTRiY2E5ZjE4NWUwYTFhNDlmYjMz"> </p>
<p class="cnNlODE4ZTRhN2FiYjQ3N2U4NWFhOTYzZWE2YzVjODM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sin stared at the registry file, her registry file. The complete file no longer had Pirate, and the massive warning on top of it. That data was still there, but… It had her listed as a Citizen.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzIzN2U5YmRmZjQ1Nzc5OWQzNjMzN2FmODhkY2Q2"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZTZlMWM4MDRkNTQ2MTZiNjQ1YWY4YjZiYWZhMTI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sin looked up. She’d honestly sort of bet that it would’t work, and she’d end up either bailing to go dirt humping again, or be trapped on board the ship working for this crazy obviously hidden noble. No matter that Grandpa had mentioned meeting her totally normal spacer parents.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWVjNjY5ZTVhMzQyYWFhZGZiMmZmMDg1MDE3MWMx"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNGVkNzYwN2E5YTQ3YjVhYTViYzhhOTc3YjA5ZTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sin wasn’t going to stop thinking she was the love child of someone no matter what ‘evidence’ the woman gave.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGIwOWFlZTExMDQxYjVhMTM5ODJiZDI4OWIyODE0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYTEyMWFjOGFmYjRmNjg4NjAwMDdlMDY5NWFjZmUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">But…</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjZlYTg1YjUzODQyZDJiNmFhOTlmYzliNDZhZDM5"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYjRiZTIyMTFlYzRkYTI5Y2NjZjgwNWViYWQzMDk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuck.” She whispered as it hit her, this random ass woman had just given her back her life. “This is real?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmEyNmM0ZTQ5MDQyMWQ5ZGI3N2E5Y2U3NTBmOWNm"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOTM2MzZkOTFjNDRlNjBhZTU2MTE5NjBiNzg5NGU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep. I reached out to the noble I know, and he agreed to clear you… I might also have been offered a job closer to the front lines in the future, but that’s a future problem.” She added, but Sin was just in awe at what she was looking at. This was…</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTk4MDNhODE2YjRkNWNiYjgxZjMwMWUzMzkzZWYz"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MjBkOGNjZjIyYzQ0MjU4NzczYzY3MzFlODg0ZWJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoa!” The Captain… No, Sin might need to actually start calling her Katherine. It wasn’t very often that someone literally fixes your entire lifes fuck up in one action. But Sin was more focused on leaving. Her scramble past Katherine earning her shout was just pure need to move. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjY2MGZjYzk3ODRlZDJiMTU4ZGIzMDY2ZmEzNTgx"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MGY2ZDY0NzllNDQ4YTdhOWI1YWE4NzJiZTdjYTFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">But then she stopped, turned and rushed back into her room, probably better to throw on some actual clothes, wouldn’t want to freak out the poor innocent station folk.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjNmMWUzNDZjOTRiNDBiNzVkN2RiNTE5YmEyZmI4"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNWE5Y2M0ZDk1MzQ2Y2M5MGM5Y2Y1MDdmOWMyNjA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">—--</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjM3NDc0MGM5ZjQ4MWM5NmEwMjZlYjc0NjA3ZWEw"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNDllZTljNzk4OTQ1YzU5YzdjNDUwNDk2YTQ3MWM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sin stepping onto UNK-L was a bit of a trip. I’d headed to the airlock and then over to the station… Mostly because I was really curious how everyone would react, and the answer was funnily.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTI2MGI3M2QzZjRlNGY4NTIwNjUyNzc0YzE0Njdm"> </p>

<p class="cnNmMTE4NDAzYjI4YzQyODg4YTVmNGJkNGYyNTA4ZDIw"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YzRiMjVmYjFiZDRkYmJhZDc4NDdlYjg1MmM5YWY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well grab a tool, the Crabbit can tell you what needs doing.” I offered and she instantly soured a bit.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWY2ZjZhMWVkYTQwMWY4M2FhZGZmMTU4ODE1NTA4"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NmNhODVlMjk5YjQwYjU4ZDcxNmY3YmVlYjk0N2M5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, she can join up with us.” Carter said, smiling charmingly. “We’re nearly done here, Sam! Why don’t you go help out the other crew?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a chance Carter.” Sam offered the older boy smiled winningly, and I just wanted to roll my eyes. She was way too old for Carter.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjRjM2U3ZjBkMjQwNTk5YzE3ZDQwYWI1ODRmZDk2"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYjA2YmM2MTA0MDQ2MzBhMGZiMzk4OTllM2RkMGJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well well.” Sin said, suddenly sauntering in, bypassing me, and Carter and leaning against the missile rack as she sort of hovered over Sam. “Maybe someone will be kind enough to buy me a drink instead?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh yeah, that I can do.” Sam added smiling dopily up at the pirate girl.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmQxOTYzMmRkNzQ3Yzc4NDYwM2RkODYzNjhlZWQx"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMzc2ZjU1YWI4YzQ5MTM4MzhhY2IzMzk2YmQ1YWM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ugh. Gag me with a spoon. I looked over and saw Carter not taking it well. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yjc3ZGFmODMyYTQ5ZGNhOWMzZDhmNGEwNDEzMjQ4"> </p>
<p class="cnNmOTc5NDIyNTEwNTQwOWI4YWIyZWJmZTRhN2M5MmVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright! No drinks until the work is done!” I called out and reached over and grabbed Sin by the back of her stupid tattered jacket that made her look so cool and suddenly she yelped as I pulled her out of the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTI1OWExNzc4YTRlOWVhMTZmNThiMjkzNDFkNWFl"><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-hey!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Flirt with my workers once they’re done with the work.” I told her firmly as she turned on me and then realized she had to look up to meet my face.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmU4NWQyZGI5MjQ5NGM4NGEzMjY1NWQzNmQxODU4"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYTg2ZTg5MWIwYzQwYTFiZjllZDVhOTYwZTlkMWY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a moment of tension before Sin seemed to ease up shoulders lowering. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTFmYzM4OGYzZDQ0MGQ4ZDc4MGMzMTBhYTRhNDM5"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZjFlMzVkZDZkNzQ1Mzk4OGQ5NmQzMTQ4YWFhNDk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah that’s fair. Sorry, just figured it would be fun to get a drink.” She offered and I eased up too.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjk5NzczODU0MDRlNmFhNzk3YmE1ZTMzOTRlNTAy"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZGM1MmEyMDBmZDQwY2Q4ZDEyNDY3YmMxZjkzMzJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well you’ll make Sam’s day if you do find him after.” I added with a bit of a sigh.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sam huh? Heh. It’s been a while since I was free to walk around on a station and flirt with boys and stuff… It’s been a long time.” She said a little airly, and I realized that Sin for all her confidence was actually…</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDc4NWVkNzQ3ZTQ4N2M5MmY1ZDA3MzM4ZjA5MDRi"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MTlhZjVlNTE1NjQ1YmNiZmZhNzQzODFkOGJkNzdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably pretty lonely. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDQyY2Q1ZTczZjQ4OTliYjIzYTYyYzM3M2JiZjRk"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NWU0NWI3OTgyMzQ4YmE5ZTJlOTk5YjVmOTdmNzU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They really had you locked away huh?” I asked, and she looked at me, to the open door and jerked her head. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjgwZWNmOWI5MTRmNDE4OGVhZmM5Yzc1Y2EyZjQz"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZmQ3ZmZhNDVmNTQ3OGJhOWNhNmM2MmI2ODlkMDk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah probably a good idea, considering I could see two shadows on the other side of the door obviously listening in.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmFmZjQ1YjExMzQ3Y2Y5YzkyOGY3ODkwYTk2MzY5"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MTNhZDU2NjE5YjQ1NWE4YTMxMjFiNzQ3YmZhOTc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Boys.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3NDIyZjFlMzc3YjQwYmViM2M4Yzc3ZWMwNGFkZTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took her to the one place on the ship where we could get some privacy up to the bridge.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTBhNWM1N2NmYzQ0NWI4Y2UyYjI4Y2E5NjJhNjBi"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMGYzNTNiMzE2NTQzMjE5NTBiMjAxZjBjZDdmM2Q1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I even shut the hatch behind me as I climbed up, giving us all the privacy we’d need.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmQ4NjNkMjFkMTQ1NjJiZmEyMGQ1MjQwYTU2YjAw"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZGYyNzQzYjcwYjQ5YmNiYmJjNDU4NTA5NzEzNGQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It wasn't that bad.” She finally said, as we settled into chairs on the bridge. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzc0NDk2MDkyZDRkNGI5YmM1YjM4NzNkYjdhNTJm"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMmUzNDBmMzFiNDRkYzQ5NzVlNGNmMjNhNzVhYmRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really. You’d think the whole pirate thing… Listen, you only really get two types of pirates. Real evil fucks, and yeah those suck, and the ones that just want to do what they want. Sometimes they were criminals beforehand, sometimes they’re running from something… I was running, from home, but well. I joined because of a boy.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I blinked at the admittance from the older woman and my expression must have said something because she laughed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDJmZDdjZWU1MTQwODdiZTg3NjU3M2E3YjBmNjcy"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMDM5MGYyMTRiNjRhOTZiM2NiMGExM2IzMTJmOWNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You think that’s weird?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really. Lots of girls join pirate crews to be with their rough and tumble man… It was… At first, a real adventure. Trent… He was gruff and strong, but kind enough. Until he wasn’t. Eventually it got bad enough I went to the captain. I’d been doing the electronic warfare side of things for a while. I didn’t have any history as a soldier or anything, but I learned that to be useful, and because I was useful.” She trailed off for a moment her eyes far away.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“He stepped in?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep. Trent didn’t take it well, but I wasn’t in his bunk anymore… But that’s when the issues started. You ever had a jealous ex?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope.” I admitted freely. I had to admit, I was kinda… Real stories of a space pirate right from the source? This was fascinating.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjUxMjRiMjVlYjQ0ZDFhZjU5MDQ4NmY2ZjI3Y2Y0"> </p>
<p class="cnM2Nzk2MzA5M2M5YzQ1OWZiMjJjZjMzMjE3MjYwMmY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well it sucked. I flirted with a guy at a bar once a few months after the breakup, and I was never allowed to go on planet again. Trent killed the poor guy, and burned the bar down. Really fucked us over too.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTAyNDZjOThiZjRjMDlhM2I5MmVhMTdmMTdlYjk5"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MmFjMGYyYjhiNjRlMmQ5NGRmYThiMjZlNTA2OTlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Charming.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh.” She shrugged. “Like I said, it lost the shine… I don’t regret it, you know? To be clear. Joining, going off world and becoming a pirate. It sucked sometimes, but it let me escape from just being a broodmare to some farmer on some dustball. I have a skill that’s valuable, and I got to see amazing things.” She said, sounding almost nostalgic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“And kill a lot of people that didn’t deserve it.” I bit out a bit harshly. Pointedly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Less than you’d think.” She admitted, but there was no apology. We stared at each other for a while before she sighed. “This is still kinda awkward. You’re so… Young. Even if you ripped us a new port with this ship. I talked to some of your family, still shocking you aren’t some noble kid. You’re a new captain, newer than I realized.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.” I agreed, I knew at some point it would come out. How new to all this I was.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTdlYTYxZGM4YzRhNDY5N2MzOTBkZjgyMDZjZmIx"> </p>
<p class="cnNiODkxZDE5MzE5MjRhOTg4OWQyMzE0Zjg3OGZkZmUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen. You’re fucking weird, and I still don’t entirely believe you aren’t some nobles bastard that no wants to admit to… But you came through for me, so I’ll work for you for a while. I’ll be straight. You won’t have to worry about a knife in the dark from me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Which I hadn’t worried about until now that she brought it up! Was I going to have to set guard Crabbits!?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTdmNjU2NGI0MzQ3MWRhMTViMGY4MTM2MWI0MDcy"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMDIzNzM2ZTRkOTRmNWFiNmZkMmEzODhjOTZmZWM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, well I’m going to enjoy my freedom for a bit." She offered as she rose up and stretched and then just walked away…</span></p>
